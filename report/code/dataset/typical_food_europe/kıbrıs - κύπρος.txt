description=Spoon sweets are a traditional Greek and Cypriot custom and a sign of hospitality – fruits, nuts, and vegetables are placed in sugar syrup, remaining firm and retaining their original color, flavor, and aroma. They are called spoon sweets because the standard serving portion is a well-filled teaspoon which is offered to guests at numerous Greek homes.It is believed that when the custom first started to appear, everyone took spoon sweets from the same bowl as a precautionary measure – it was a way to know that the food was not poisoned. Even though spoon sweets are made throughout Greece, some of them are linked to specific regions: Andros is known for lemon and orange blossoms, Chios for grapes, figs, and mandarins, Santorini and Kos for their small, cinnamon-flavored tomatoes and almonds, Crete is famous for its grape and raisin sweets, while the Peloponnese is known for every imaginable citrus.Since these sweet treats have no fat, they are one of the Mediterranean's healthiest sweet products which can even be used as a topping for ice cream, yogurt, and various cakes.

description=Cyprus flake salt is a natural crystal flake sea salt from the Mediterranean Sea surrounding the island of Cyprus. It is recognized for its unique, thin pyramid-shaped crystals formed through a meticulous solar evaporation process.This process involves channeling sea water into a series of shallow ponds or lagoons, known as "salins," and then into large pans where the water is gradually heated, eventually forming the salt's characteristic pyramid shapes​. The creation of Cyprus flake salt can take up to two years from start to finish, attesting to the care and tradition invested in its production.The salt is not only aesthetically distinctive with its sparkling white crystals but also offers a mild taste typical of Mediterranean salts. Its light and fluffy texture makes it a popular choice for both cooking and baking, and it is commonly used as a finishing salt, particularly as a garnish for fish and vegetable dishes, because of its ability to add a delicate crunch without overpowering the main flavors.The large flake size also makes Cyprus flake salt suitable for salads and other dishes where a visible, textural element is desired.
