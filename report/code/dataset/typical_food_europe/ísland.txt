food_type=smoked-fish
description=One of the staples of traditional Icelandic diet, harðfiskur is a fish delicacy made by following an old preserving method that involves drying fresh fish on wooden racks, outdoors in the cool Icelandic wind.

food_type=sheep
description=The Icelandic sheep is a breed of domestic sheep that originates from Iceland.

The breed is dual-purpose, raised both for meat and wool. Icelandic sheep are quite distinctive in appearance. They are medium-sized, with both males and females often possessing horns.Their fleece, which is dual-coated, consists of a warm inner layer (thel) and a weather-resistant outer layer (tog). This wool is popular for knitting and weaving and is used for making "lopapeysa", traditional Icelandic sweaters. These sheep are also well adapted to harsh climates, being able to survive and thrive in rugged landscapes and extreme cold.
