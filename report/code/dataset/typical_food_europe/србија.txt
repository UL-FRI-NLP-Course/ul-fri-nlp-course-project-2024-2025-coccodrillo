description=Pljeskavica, a Serbian national dish also known as theSerbian hamburger, is a flat, round patty made from minced beef, pork, and veal, or a combination of the three, with the addition of selected seasonings such as paprika, salt and pepper, and in some cases, finely minced onions and garlic.It is a simple dish that is hard to master, as the ratio of meat and fat is extremely important in the preparation process. Flavorful and juicy, the wordpljeskavicacomes from the wordpljeskati, meaningto clap, since this is the motion made when forming the patties that are then grilled on both sides to a smoky brown color, with typical grill marks on both sides.Traditionally, the meat is then placed inside a thick flatbread calledlepinja, which is as equally important as the meat - it should not be too dry, cold, nor crumbly, but moist, springy, and warm. The perfect pljeskavica should be juicy, perfectly spiced, and preferably topped withkajmak–a rich, clotted, slightly salty, local cream cheese.Read more

food_type=savory-pastry
description=Burek sa sirom is a phyllo pastry that is round or coil-shaped and filled with a mixture of cheese and eggs. The dough is made with flour, salt, and water (and perhaps a bit of oil) and stretched into translucent sheets. The sheets of phyllo dough are stacked in a large tray, and each sheet is sprinkled with oil or oil and mineral water and spread with the cheese and egg filling.Still, you might have heard that burek can only be called burek if it's filled with meat. That is, if you live in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but not everyone does, nor is burek really Bosnian – in fact, it has Turkish origins. In Bosnia, burek (with meat) and other types of similar pies such assirnica(cheese) andkrumpiruša(potatoes) are usually rolled into a coil, while Croatians and Serbs have a more relaxed approach – burek can be round and cut into quarters, or rolled into a coil – both shapes are good, and both can be called burek sa sirom (when filled with cheese, of course).Initially, burek was brought over to Niš in the 15th century, and it was prepared as a round pie. After World War II, burek came to Croatia and Slovenia. The termburek sa sirom, denoting a round or coil-shaped pie filled with cheese has been so engrained into Croatian culture (for more than 50 years) that it can be considered a Croatian classic regardless of its name.The most important thing is that it's delicious, filling, and a great breakfast staple for many Serbs and Croatians, especially when paired with a refreshing cup of yogurt on the side.
