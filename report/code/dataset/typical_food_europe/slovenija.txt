food_type=Desserts
description=This well-known dessert is a traditional dish of Prekmurje, Slovenia’s northeastern region whose recipes have often been inspired by Hungarian and Austrian traditions. According to the Etymological Dictionary of the Slovenian Language, Prekmurska gibanica is a variety ofpotica, a layered strudel pie characteristic for the eastern part of the country.The name comes fromgibâničnik, a type ofpastry basket, orgibâničar, an old Slovenian word for abaker. The oldest written records of Prekmurska gibanica date back to the 1700s when it was first mentioned asgebanza, while another written source from 1828 described it as a dessert that is typically served at weddings. This interesting combination of different fillings and paper-thin phyllo strudel pastry is actually very common in Central European cuisine, but what makes Slovenian gibanica different from the others is the bottom layer, often made with shortcrust pastry.The fillings used to make Prekmurska gibanica are divided by butter-brushed pastry sheets and layered in this exact order: poppy seeds, cottage cheese, ground walnuts, and grated apples. Also, the original gibanica has eight layers of filling, which means that the layering is done twice, finished with another sheet of pastry, and brushed with egg wash before baking.Traditionally prepared during festive seasons, Prekmurska gibanica has a rich flavor, an intense aroma, and must retain its succulent sweetness without being too greasy.

description=Classified as a semi-soft cheese of a white to pale yellowish or buttery beige color,Mohantis made from raw cow's milk. It's famous for a savory and quite tangy taste, slightly bitter, and a strong musty aroma, which makes it distinguishable from other cheeses produced across the country.The traditional method of producing Mohant in two phases, together with a specific process of ripening, has a great influence on its final flavor and lumpy texture. In summer, when the cheese naturally ripens faster and it takes only about six weeks to mature, Mohant is made from full-fat milk, while in winter skimmed milk is used instead, and it can take up to three months to ripen. This Slovenian cheese variety is traditionally made in the historical Goriška region of northwestern Slovenia, namely on farms and villages around the Bohinj basin in the Julian Alps.On the outskirts of Triglav National Park, Mohant is often enjoyed as a side to various dishes, but it's more commonly eaten with a spoon, served with boiled unskinned potatoes.

food_type=dry-cured-hams
description=The gold standard of Slovenian cured meats -Kraški pršut, also known as Karstprosciuttoor simply Karst ham, is a non-smoked, dry-cured ham with more than a hundred years old tradition. Its truly authentic flavor is the result of favorable climate conditions in the Karst region, which have a direct influence on the dynamic of drying and aging.Regardless of today's technological innovations, the manufacturers of this prized ham have retained the traditional methods of production. Rich in vitamins and minerals, this extremely nutritional dry-cured ham also has an even higher protein content than the one found in cooked meat. The meat is salted twice, using only coarse salt from the Slovenian coastal region, and then left to age at a temperature of approximately 12-16°C.This natural dry-curing process doesn’t include any kind of heat or smoking treatment, just the traditional Slovenian know-how. Salted and exposed to air from the very beginning, the prosciutto gradually starts to dry, and after a while, the salt is washed off.To remove the last of the natural juices, the prosciutto is pressed into its distinctive flattened guitar-like shape and prepared for maturing, which takes about 12-16 months, depending on the size of the ham. Like most other hams of the prosciutto variety, Kraški pršut is best enjoyed sliced into thin, almost see-through strips, and traditionally served as a cold appetizer accompanied with homemade bread, cheese, olives or sometimes sweet melons.

food_type=Honey
description=One of the main distinctions of Slovenian honey comes from a very low water content and its characteristic pollen spectrum, which reflects the diverse flora of the area where honey is produced. As of 2013, the following types of honey can be marketed as Slovenski med: floral or nectar honey; forest or honeydew honey; acacia, linden, chestnut, fir and spruce honey. The production of honey in Slovenia is based exclusively on beekeeping of the Carniolan bee.This specific bee species is the second most widespread honey bee in the world, adapted to the wider area of Kočevje, once the historical region of Carniola. In fact, Slovenia is the only EU member state which has protected its native bee, after which it introduced controlled honey production in 1999.The excellence of Slovenski med is evidenced by the various awards received in both national and international competitions, for instance, numerous gold medal awards at the Apimedica & Apiquality world honey competition. Its most recent awards include the BiolMiel 2011 international organic honey competition in Italy, where Slovenian acacia and forest honey won gold medals and chestnut honey came in at 4th place.

description=Bohinjski siris a Slovenian emmentaler-style cheese originating from the Bohinj region. The cheese was first made in 1873 when a cheesemaker from Switzerland started to educate local shepherds about Swiss cheese production. Bohinjski sir is made from raw or thermized cow's milk.Underneath its firm and dry natural rind, the texture is hard and open with many large eyes dispersed throughout the body. The flavors are aromatic, mild, and nutty, but with prolonged maturation the cheese becomes even more aromatic and slightly piquant.In the past, the first stage of ripening was done on highland farms, and the cheese was then brought to valley dairies for prolonged ripening at higher temperatures, while the final stage of maturation was done in a cold place once again for further flavor development.

description=Known as the 'Slovenian cheese that tastes like the wind',Nanoški siris a type of hard cheese made of cow milk from the animals pastured on slopes of the Nanos mountain. It takes about two months for the Nanos cheese to ripen, after which it acquires its pleasantly salty to slightly spicy taste, and quite an intense scent. As the cheese ages, its aroma and piquant flavor become even stronger.Easily distinguished by its peach colored rind, Nanos cheese comes in wheels weighing from 8 to 11 kilos. Also, the milk used for the production of Nanoški sir has to be obtained exclusively from Brown Swiss cows, which are pastured within the designated area of Nanos, Vipava Valley and the Karst plateau.While the unique flora of the region makes a significant difference when it comes to milk quality, the climate conditions together with strong Bora winds have a major influence on the maturing process and cheese quality.

Due to a considerably high percentage of salinity in the Gulf of Trieste together with favorable climate conditions, here on the Slovenian coast, Piran salt is traditionally produced by hand, using the same salt panning methods and tools that have been in use for over the last 700 years. Piran salt contains no additives, and since it is neither refined or rinsed, it maintains a naturally balanced composition.A unique work of nature, Piran salt is mild in flavor and varies in subtle undertones of a distinct sea aroma.

Made by choosing only the finest of pork legs, together with the skin and bacon, Prekmurje hams are traditionally dry-cured in salt and spices, smoked and then gradually coated with a mixture of buckwheat flour, red peppers and spices.Lastly, they are left to mature for a period of at least 6 months. During that time, relatively dry but harsh winters, with brisk air coming from Goričko hills, and other conditions typical for the continental climate together contribute to the making of the final product. Considerably smaller in size, Prekmurje ham weighs in at about 3 to 4 kilograms.On the outside, the color of the ham is evenly dark reddish to brown, which is rather typical for strongly smoked products, while on the inside the meat is medium to dark red, with creamy white to yellowish fat. Its distinctive flavor reveals subtle hints of beechwood smokiness.According to an old Slovenian custom, Prekmurje ham is usually served on a wooden board in centimeter thick slices, cut into smaller strips.
