description=The story of the invention of this everyday household name changes depending on how you define it. If you think a pizza is an oven-baked flatbread, its origins lie in the ancient Middle East. If pizza must have toppings, its origins date back to the ancient Romans and Greeks, who baked flatbreads and topped them with available, local spices and olive oil.But the pizza we all know today, made with tomato sauce, cheese, and numerous toppings, originated in Italy. It became popular in Naples in the 18th century as a cheap, nourishing food that was consumed mainly by peasants. The modern pizza as we know it today evolved from early Neapolitan flatbreads topped with lard, salt, and garlic.No one knows when or why the tomato first began being used in the preparation of pizza, but it is known that they were first recorded in Italy in 1544. While most Europeans initially disparaged them as poisonous, the southern Italians embraced them, giving them the name pomi d’oro (golden apples).Although some say that tomatoes have been used on pizza marinara since 1734, others claim that they were not used until the early 19th century. The Italians credit Raffaele Esposito of Pizzeria Brandi as having invented the first modern pizza in 1889.He was supposed to make a variety of pizzas for the queen, so he made one with lard, cheese, and basil, one with fish, and one with mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. Known as pizza alla mozzarella at the time, this last pizza later became known as pizza margherita, once the queen declared it as her favorite.Interestingly enough, the colors of the margherita are the same as those found on the Italian flag. Pizza crossed over the Italian border shortly thereafter, to Spain, France, England, and the United States, where it was introduced by Italian immigrants.However, it didn’t gain much popularity until after World War II. In the United States, the first pizzeria was opened in New York City by Gennaro Lombardi in 1905, and since then it has become one of the most popular food items in the United States.In an ironic twist of fate, American-style pizza has been re-exported back to Italy, where it is has also gained in popularity today. In 2008, two Italian associations called Real Pizza and the Association of Neapolitan Pizza-makers introduced new regulations on what constitutes a true Neapolitan pizza.According to them, the real, legally-protected Neapolitan margherita should be made with exact amounts of mozzarella, salt, and tomatoes, and it should be baked in a wood-fired oven at 485°C. Today, there are numerous variations of this beloved dish throughout the world, from those with simple toppings such as ham, prosciutto, onions, and bell peppers, to unusual variations such as hot dog or hamburger pizza or decadent toppings such as white truffles, edible gold, lobster, and caviar.

description=This widely popular and extremely versatile group of dishes consists of a base of rice and stock. Butter, saffron, and parmesan are some of the ingredients most often combined with the base to make a variety of flavorful risottos. The history of the dish is rife with conflicting theories about its origins, however, it is certain that rice was first introduced to Italy by the Arabs during the Middle Ages.Since the Mediterranean climate was perfect for growing short-grain rice, huge amounts of it started to be sold - primarily in Venice, Genoa, and the surrounding areas. As rice gained in popularity, it became a staple food of the Po valley, Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto, and the city of Milan.It was only a matter of time before rice was combined with saffron, which the Milan region was famous for, and the legendary risotto alla Milanese was invented. Even today, risotto is still usually prepared using the same key components: rice, stock, butter, wine, parmesan, saffron, and onions.The dish is served throughout the world, so there are also a number of varieties with ingredients such as truffles, squid ink, asparagus, sausage, scallops, and veal, among many others.

food_type=pasta
description=Tagliatelle al ragù alla Bolognese is a traditional dish originating from Bologna, consisting of tagliatelle pasta and a rich ragù made with a mixture of minced beef and pork, and tomatoes as key ingredients. Even though they are often thought to be synonymous, tagliatelle al ragù—one of Bologna's signature dishes—bears little or no resemblance to the dish known as spaghetti Bolognese in the rest of the world.In fact, the world famous Italian ragù alla Bolognese meat sauce is never served with spaghetti in Bologna. Instead, when it isn't served over fresh tagliatelle, you will most often find it topping a bed of some other other ribbon-like pasta, such as fettuccine or pappardelle.Regardless of the type of pasta used, what makes or breaks this classic Emilian dish is the ragù itself. Experts nowadays tend to consider the recipe for ragù alla Bolognese registered by the Italian Academy of Cuisine in October 1982 the most authentic version.However, chances are that every restaurant and trattoria in Emilia Romagna dishes out its own version of tagliatelle al ragù, and each version is surely worth trying.

description=The carbonara we know today is prepared by simply tossing spaghetti withguanciale(cured pork jowl), egg yolks, and Pecorino Romano cheese. Despite its simplicity, this dish remains one of Rome's favorites, equally popular throughout the country.Even though carbonara is considered a typical Roman dish today, its origins are quite vague and often disputed. The name is said to have been derived from thecarbonari, woodcutters and charcoal-makers who lived in the Appenine mountains northeast of Rome, and who supposedly cooked their pasta over a hardwood charcoal fire and tossed it with eggs and cheese.Another popular theory claims that carbonara was invented after the liberation of Rome in 1944, when food shortages were so severe that Allied troops distributed bacon and powdered eggs, which the local population would then mix with water to make pasta sauce.

food_type=pasta
description=The word ravioli denotes various kinds of pasta made by placing a filling between two thin layers of dough. The pasta used is typically wheat flour and egg based, and it acts as an enclosure while also binding with the sauce or broth the ravioli is cooked or served in.Ravioli are usually served boiled with a sauce as a first course, or boiled and served in broth as a traditional winter dish. Ravioli fillings include diverse varieties of meat, cheese, and vegetables, and they vary from region to region. There are also sweet ravioli, which are usually deep-fried.Although no one is certain when the first ravioli were made exactly, the earliest written recipe for ravioli appears in a 14th-century document written by Francesco di Marco, a Tuscan merchant. Today, modern regional varieties are distinguished by their fillings, by the ingredients used in the dough (such as olive oil in southern Italy), and by their shape, which can be square, round, rectangular, or half-moon with straight or serrated edges.

food_type=Dumplings
description=This is the traditional Italian form of dumplings. Today, the word gnocchi usually refers to a dumpling made with potato-based dough shaped into thick bite-sized pieces and pressed into a ribbed wooden board or grater to create an imprint, which helps the sauce to adhere to each piece.They are typically boiled in large amounts of salted water or fried in shallow oil, a technique typical for some Italian regions. Gnocchi are believed to have been a predecessor of pasta, and historical records show that the term gnocchi, or gnocco, was sometimes interchangeably used with the word maccherone, a word that once referred to all pasta in general.Before the introduction of the potato, they were made with any available flour, most commonly wheat and semolina, while gnocchi in mountain regions was made with barley, rye, or chestnut flour. During times of extreme poverty, they were occasionally made with grated and soaked stale bread.Potato only became the star gnocchi ingredient in the 19th century, by which time this New World import had begun making common appearances in Italian households. The proportion of flour and mashed potatoes has drastically changed since the first potato gnocchi was created – today, mashed potatoes are the foundation of the dough, with only a small amount of flour used to bind the ingredients together.Although potato gnocchi are the most common variety, Italy is abound with numerous gnocchi varieties, and each Italian region has its own favorite. These varieties often bear different names, such as malfatti, strangulaprievete, malloreddus, or cavattieli, and they use different base ingredients such as ricotta, spinach, pumpkin, and even beetroot.The essential accompaniment to any gnocchi serving is the sauce. The most common are traditional tomato sauce and flavorful butter and sage, but the possibilities are numerous and often include creamy cheese-based sauces, ragùs, and extras such as cured meat and vegetables, combined with fragrant Italian herbs and spices.

description=Even though tiramisù is actually a fairly recent invention, this dessert of coffee-soaked ladyfingers layered with mascarpone cream enjoys an iconic status among Italian desserts. Its name stems from the phrasetirami sù, an Italian expression which literally meanspick me up, a reference to the uplifting effects of sugar, liquor, and coffee.The origins of tiramisù are heavily disputed between Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions, but it is often suggested that the first was made in Veneto in the early 1960s. The earliest documented recipe for tiramisù (interestingly, without alcohol!) was printed in the 1981 spring edition ofVin Venetomagazine in an article on coffee-based desserts by Giuseppe Maffioli, a renowned food critic and member of the Italian Academy of Cuisine.However, in August 2017, Friuli-Venezia Giulia's tiramisu was officially added to the list of traditional regional dishes, but a Veneto local won the Tiramisu World Cup in November 2017, so the playing field is somewhat levelled once again. Regardless of these disputes, the perfect tiramisù should always deliver a serious caffeine kick from a shot of strong espresso, while brandy-fortified Marsala wine adds a nice sweet buzz.In 2021, Ado Campeol, the owner of the restaurant where tiramisù is widely thought to have been invented, has died.

food_type=Pizzas
description=Italy’s most emblematic culinary creation, the genuine pizza Napoletana is made with just a few simple ingredients and prepared in only two variations –marinara, the basic Neapolitan pizza topped with a tomato-based sauce flavored with garlic and oregano, andmargherita, which is topped with tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil leaves, a delicious combination whose colors are said to represent the Italian flag.The crust is very thin at the base, and the dough puffs up on the sides, which results in airy crust that should have typical charred 'leopard spots' if baked properly. The origins of this iconic Neapolitan dish can be traced to the early 1700s, when what we know today as pizza marinara was first described by Italian chef, writer, and philosopher Vincenzo Corrado in his treatise on the eating habits of the people of Naples.Almost 200 years later, in 1889, the premier Neapolitan master pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito added mozzarella to the mix and invented the margherita, which is now generally cited as the first modern pizza. Originally dubbedla pizza tricolore, Esposito’s creation is said to have been made in honor of and named after Margherita of Savoy, the Queen consort of the Kingdom of Italy, who was visiting Naples at the time.In 2010, as one of Italy’s most popular foods worldwide, pizza Napoletana was officially recognized by the European Union and granted the designation of Traditional Specialty Guaranteed. And remember, a good pizza Napoletana doesn't need any additions other than the designated toppings.

In 1889, Queen Margherita of Savoy visited Naples, where she was served a pizza that was made to resemble the colors of the Italian flag: red tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese, and green basil.It was made by a chef named Raffaele Esposito of Pizzeria Brandi, who is credited for its invention. The Queen loved the dish, and Esposito named it after her - pizza Margherita, but such a pizza was also made before that time, and can be dated back to at least 1866, when the most popular pizza toppings included basil, cheese, and tomatoes, but the pizza was not yet named Margherita.Since those times, Margherita has become one of the most popular pizza varieties in the world, and in 2009, it was protected as one of the threePizze Napoletanewith an STG European label of protection, proving its excellence in flavor, ingredients, and traditional pizza-making techniques.

description=Bruschetta is a traditional appetizer that's nowadays popular throughout the world. In its simplest form known asfettunta, this classic appetizer consists of a grilled slice of bread rubbed with garlic and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.According to Marcella Hazan, a cookery writer and one of the foremost authorities on Italian cuisine, the history of bruschetta dates back to ancient Rome – its name stems from the old Latin bruscare (meaning “to roast over coals”).Once merely a snack of Italian farmers and olive pickers, the versatile bruschetta has grown into one of the most delicious antipasti Italian cuisine has to offer. Nowadays, bruschetta comes in virtually infinite varieties: spread with bell pepper, mushroom, eggplant, or zucchini pâtés, and topped with small chunks of eggplant, figs, scamorza cheese, mozzarella, or even anchovies, prosciutto, or various types of salami.However, even though it might seem that there isn’t much to this simple grilled bread appetizer, the secret to a perfect bruschetta is in its simplicity.

description=This is one of the oldest types of confections, and varieties can be found throughout Italy, Spain, France, the Balkans, and the Middle East. Although each region has its own distinctive type, most nougats are made of whipped egg white mixed with roasted chopped nuts such as almonds, pistachios, walnuts, and hazelnuts.The result is a sweet treat with a chewy consistency. The exact origin of nougat is hard to trace, but the first recipe for a sweet resembling white nougat callednatifwas recorded in a 10th-century book found in Baghdad. Nougat can be divided into numerous categories, but the most basic distinction is made between soft or hard nougat, depending on whether it is made with honey or sugar.In Italy, nougat is known astorrone, and each city and region has its own traditional type of torrone, ranging from hard versions made with sugar to soft and chewy honey-based varieties. French nougat is predominately made without eggs and with a larger proportion of nuts, while the Spanish usually use roasted almonds and raw honey.Viennese nougat is somewhat different from the other types –it is made of finely ground cocoa butter, nuts, and cocoa mass, resulting in a soft chocolaty blend that is usually incorporated with other confections. Most traditional nougats are usually eaten on their own as a dessert or sweet snack, and the festive appearance of sliced nougat has earned it a regular place on various regional holiday platters.

Even though panna cotta (lit. cooked cream) wasn't mentioned in Italian cookbooks until the 1960s, today it is considered a traditional Piedmontese dessert, and the original recipe calls for only whole cream, sugar, vanilla, and gelatin.When made to perfection and properly chilled, panna cotta is silky smooth, deliciously creamy, and has a gentle wobble to it. For a slightly lighter version of this scrumptious dessert, use half-and-half instead of heavy cream, or simply dilute heavy cream with milk.According to Anna Del Conte, a renowned food writer and leading figure in Italian cuisine, classic Piedmontese panna cotta is served on its own or sometimes accompanied with Brutti ma buoni hazelnut meringue biscotti, while the Valle d’Aosta version of panna cotta is flavored with a dash of peach eau-de-vie and garnished with red berry coulis.In other parts of Italy, panna cotta is frequently flavored with rum or sweet Marsala wine and topped with a generous drizzle of caramel sauce, which perfectly complements the seductive aroma of vanilla. Imagination being the only limit, variations on this elegant dessert are virtually endless, and it can be easily tailored to anyone’s taste.

description=Marinara is a red sauce consisting of olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs. Onions might sometimes get added to the combination of these ingredients, and marinara might be transformed into another sauce such asarrabbiataorputtanescawith the addition of different ingredients.Due to its simplicity, marinara acts as a versatile base for many Italian dishes. It originated in Naples in southern Italy, its name derived from the Italian word for sailors (marinai). Some say it was named after the sailors because marinara's ingredients didn't spoil easily, and the sauce could be prepared quickly, in about the same time it took pasta to cook, so the two made a flavorful and cheap meal for sailors on their voyages.By the early 1900s, marinara became a classic in the United States of America as well, due to a large number of Italian immigrants. Today, it is commonly served hot with pasta such as ziti, linguini, or spaghetti.

They are commonly referred as navels, originating from the famous legend which claims that a chef created it after he saw the goddess Venus, and modeled it on the look of her belly button.The first written record of tortellini goes back to the 17th century, although it is probable that they were created earlier than that. It is believed that they originate from the Emilia-Romagna area, specifically cities Modena and Bologna. Unlike other pasta varieties, tortellini were considered a luxurious food, usually served during important holidays or festivities.The stuffing usually employed at the time lavish ingredients such as prosciutto, mortadella, parmesan cheese, pancetta, beef, or veal, all finely chopped to create a dense filling. Tortellini can be served in broth or sauce, but according to tradition, the only right way is to serve them submerged in a sizzling broth, usually made with chicken or beef.Serving them in soup promotes the tortellini as the star ingredient, not overshadowed by a fragrant sauce or heaps of parmesan. The original way of preparation and serving has not drastically changed; tortellini are still made with traditional egg pasta and utilize the same ingredients to create a hearty filling.However, modern variations nowadays occasionally add natural coloring to pasta, like spinach and beetroot, and tomato, cream, or ragu-like sauces are more often used to accompany the tender tortellini. Today, this refined pasta is considered a common ingredient, cherished in Italy and around the world.It is usually factory produced, but the homemade varieties, using fresh pasta, are considered to be a true delicacy.

Historians tend to believe it was invented either by the Etruscans or in ancient Greece, although unleavened flatbreads have long been made throughout the Middle East.The name focaccia is derived from the Roman panis focacius, meaning “hearth bread”, referring to the fact that focaccia was traditionally baked in coals in Roman times. The basic recipe spread to France and Spain over time, where the bread is known as fouaisse and hogaza, respectively.Foccacia’s pockmarked appearance results from indentations made in the dough to prevent large bubbles from appearing on its surface during baking. Today, savory versions of focaccia are topped with rosemary, sage, garlic, cheese, and onions, while sweet varieties can be topped with honey, raisins, sugar, and lemon peel, among others.

Carpaccio was created in 1950 by a Venetian restaurateur named Giuseppe Cipriani, the owner ofHarry’s Bar, who first made the dish for Countess Amalia Nani Mocenigo, whose doctors had recommended she eat raw meat.Cipriani based the dish on a specialty from Piedmont consisting of slices of raw beef dressed with lemon juice, olive oil, and white truffle shavings. An impassioned art lover, Cipriani named the new dish carpaccio in honor of painter Vittore Carpaccio, whose style and bold colors were reminiscent of the intense red color of raw meat.Today, there are numerous modern varieties of carpaccio made with zucchini, scallops, beet, salmon, figs, and lamb, and it is said that any kind of carpaccio is best paired with a glass of wine on the side.

food_type=sweet-pastry
description=These decadent, crispy fried pastry tubes filled with luscious ricotta cheese cream are perhaps one of Sicily's best known desserts outside of Italy. Cannoli are believed to have originated around Palermo during the 9th century, while Sicily was under Arab rule.Legend has it that they were originally prepared by the women of the ancient city of Qal'at al-Nisā' (lit. castle of women), the modern-day Caltanissetta, which at the time served as the harem of a Saracen emir. Later on, the recipe later somehow found its way to the monasteries of Palermo where nuns would prepare this lavish dessert during the carnival season.Cannoli have come a long way since then, becoming incredibly popular not only throughout Italy, but also in North America, where they were introduced by Sicilian immigrants in the late 19th century. Furthermore, thanks to one of the most famous lines from the movie The Godfather — "Leave the gun.Take the cannoli." — by the end of the 1970s, this dessert had attained a truly iconic status. Although people in the United States are familiar with different variations of this classic recipe, cannoli in Sicily are still prepared in a more traditional way.The crispy pastry shells are typically flavored with cocoa, suet, and Marsala wine, while the delicate freshness of the sweetened ricotta is sometimes enriched with orange blossom water, candied orange peel, chocolate, zuccata candied pumpkin, or finely chopped pistachios.The name is derived fromcanna, a cane reed that’s cut into sections and used as a mold for frying the pastry shells, although metal cylinders have mostly replaced canna nowadays. And last, but certainly not least, cannoli shells are always filled just before serving to prevent them from getting soggy, ensuring the perfect feel of crunchiness against the creamy filling.

This oven-baked classic is a typical dish of the Emilia-Romagna region, and of the city of Bologna specifically.However, it has become so popular over time that it now enjoys a position as a worldwide symbol of Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, as is often the case with timeless dishes, changes to the original recipe or the substitution of lower-quality ingredients cause many renditions of lasagne alla Bolognese that fail to live up to the splendor of the original.Interestingly enough, in many bolognese households, there is a special deep oven casserole with handles calledruola, made of aluminum and used for baking lasagne alla bolognese.

Historically, being a poor man's food dating as far back as the year 30 CE, this peasant-style soup was made with a mashed bean or spelt base and leftovers from variouscontorni(side dishes) and other meals. Today, even though there's not a set recipe for this dish and every region has its own version, the most common ingredients include stock, onions, tomatoes, celery, carrots, and legumes.The vegetables are cut-up and simmered for quite a long time, but they must not turn mushy. Lastly, pasta or rice can be added to round-up this inexpensive, yet filling dish. Depending on the method of cooking, these flavorful soups are divided into two main categories:minestrone a crudoandminestrone col soffritto.While the first version uses raw vegetables and often garlic-flavored olive oil added towards the end of cooking, minestrone col soffritto is made with vegetables which are first sautéed in butter, oil, pork fat or lard, together with pancetta (bacon) and pork rind.The perfect comfort food to warm a cold day, minestrone is even better when made in advance and served reheated, as it takes some time for the flavors to fuse and deepen.

Nor, in fact, does it have any connection with the city of Parma whatsoever. In fact, the name of this scrumptious summer dish supposedly stems from parmisciana, the word for “Persian” in the Sicilian dialect, and it is often suggested that the word is rooted in the Arabic badhnajan or Turkish patlıcan, both of which mean “eggplant”.Although the eggplant was introduced to Italy by the Arabs as early as the 8th century, the parmigiana we know today may have originated in Sicily at around the 16th century, when tomatoes were first brought to Italy from the New World by the Spaniards.Later, the eggplant casserole spread across the country, taking on a version of its own in each region. Regardless of its true origins and the many different takes on the classic recipe, parmigiana di melanzane remains Southern Italian comfort food at its best, and is one of the most popular Italian dishes today.

Amatriciana was invented in the 17th century by adding tomatoes to the already famousgriciasauce – diced tomatoes are sautéed in fat rendered from juicy bits of guanciale (cured pork jowl), then tossed together with grated pecorino cheese and either spaghetti or bucatini pasta.The first recipe for Amatriciana was published in the 1790 cookbookL’Apicio Modernoby Francesco Leonardi, a renowned Roman chef and author. Over time, this classic Italian dish became so popular it was featured in several movies, from Alberto Sordi’s 1954 filmAn American in Romeand Luciano Salce’s 1978Where Are You Going on Holiday?to Ryan Murphy’sEat Pray Love, in which Julia Roberts joyfully wolfs down a portion of spaghetti all’Amatriciana while sitting on the terrace of a typical Romanosteria.With delicate heat from pepperoncino peppers, the sweetness and tartness from the tomato-based sauce, the sharpness of pecorino, and the fatty richness of guanciale, Amatriciana is best enjoyed with medium-bodied, smooth Italian reds such as Montepulciano d’Abruzzo and Sangiovese.

The perfect combination of ripe, sun-kissed tomatoes, creamy mozzarella and fresh basil - this simple salad is believed to have originated on the island of Capri, hence the name.Caprese was originally made with theRe UmbertoorFiasconetomatoes, traditionally grown along the beautiful Amalfi coast, andtreccia di Sorrento, a type of braided mozzarella cheese. Also, contrary to popular practice, the authentic Caprese salad recipe doesn't call for balsamic or any other type of vinegar.Instead, mozzarella and tomatoes are thickly sliced, arranged on a plate and garnished with basil leaves, sprinkled with some salt and white pepper, then finished with a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

description=This timeless Italian classic is another staple ofcucina povera- the traditional Italian peasant-style cooking that makes as much as possible with the fewest ingredients. Even though the official name of this simple, iconic dish literally translates tospaghetti, garlic, and oil, there's also an optional ingredient that adds a spicy kick and a nice touch of warmth - the tiny red chili pepper known in Italian aspeperoncino rosso, ordiavolillo(lit. little devil), as it is affectionately referred to in some parts of the country.The dish is made simply by tossing spaghetti together with garlic (and crushed chili for aglio, olio, and peperoncino) sautéed in olive oil. It is sometimes suggested that this basic pasta recipe might have originated in the neighboring regions of Abruzzo and Campania, but the Italian Academy of Cuisine officially listed spaghetti aglio e olio as a typical dish of Lazio.As such, it remains one of Rome's culinary darlings that can be found in nearly every trattoria in the city and throughout the region.

Cacio e pepe consists of pasta (usually spaghetti), aged Pecorino Romano cheese, salt, and lots of ground black pepper. Since the ingredients are easy to transport and do not spoil easily, it was once the favorite dish of Roman shepherds.The spicy pepper protected the shepherds from the effects of cold weather during the night, while the pasta provided them with the carbohydrates they needed to perform their back-breaking labor.

It is characterized by numerous air pockets on the interior and a crispy crust. The first ciabatta was made in 1982 by a Veronese miller and baker named Arnaldo Cavallari.The bread was invented as a response to the rising popularity of French baguette, as the bakers were worried that it might endanger their business.

description=A classic Neapolitan entrée locally known simply asaulive e chiappariell(lit. olives and capers), spaghetti alla puttanesca is a southern Italian pasta dish, often accompanied by wildly inappropriate and mostly inaccurate theories on the origin and meaning of its name.While the Italian wordputtanaliterally translates toprostituteand many people believe that this pasta dish was created at the beginning of 20th century in the brothels of Naples to be served to guests after their tiring sexual encounters, in colloquial Italian, the wordputtanatais used to describe something worthless or good-for-nothing, reflecting the fact that puttanesca is so quick and easy to make, using simple and humble ingredients and often even leftovers.Moreover, this dish falls into the so-calledspaghettatacategory, which refers to a quick meal, usually–but not necessarily–made with spaghetti, and put together at the last minute for unexpected guests. In fact, spaghetti alla puttanesca is said to have been invented in the 1950s by Sandro Petti, then a co-owner ofRancio Fellone, a famous Ischian restaurant and nightspot.Petti claims he came up with this down-and-dirty recipe one night when his friends showed up after closing time, asking him to make "una puttanata qualsiasi," meaning anything he could whip up with the little he had left in the pantry. He then cooked some spaghetti and tossed them with the zesty garlic and oregano flavored sauce made with tomatoes, olive oil, black Gaeta olives, and capers.The dish was allegedly received so well that Petti later decided to add it to the restaurant menu, naming it puttanesca in memory of that night. Today, spaghetti alla puttanesca is a dish that is commonly found not only in Naples and throughout Campania, but also in the neighboring Lazio region, where puttanesca sauce is made with the addition of salted anchovies and sometimes even chili peppers.With all these tangy ingredients, spaghetti alla puttanesca packs quite an aromatic punch, making southern Italian reds such asNero d’Avola,NegroamaraandPrimitivothe perfect accompaniments to this flavorful pasta dish.

However, throughout the region, agnolotti come in various shapes.Around Langhe and Monferrato, they are sealed with a firm pinch, which gives them their distinctive appearance, and they are calledagnolotti al plin,while the town of Asti is known foragnolotti gobbi(lit. hunchbacked) - pasta pockets that are filled so abundantly that they become slightly curved.Another interesting variety are the half-moon-shapedagnolotti a mezzaluna. They are traditionally filled with a mixture of different leftover meats which are often flavored with wine and herbs, and some of the classic fillings includestracotto- slowly braised beef, roasted rabbit, pork, or even chicken.Unique to the entire region are agnolotti filled with donkey meat, a specialty of the town of Calliano.

description=The main thing about pizza Romana is its crust: thin, extremely crunchy, and almost cracker-like, which is why it is also known under the namescrocchiarella, meaningthe crunchy one. There are a few things that make this pizza so light and crispy: olive oil - added to the basic dough - and less water in the mixture - the maximum hydration of the dough is up to 55 %.Due to a harder consistency, this dough must be stretched with a rolling pin, unlike the softer Neapolitan variety that is shaped by hand with almost acrobatic moves while being tossed in the air. Once shaped, the dough is covered with a sparse layer of tomato sauce and chosen toppings – they can vary, but the most traditional combination would include mozzarella, anchovies, capers, chopped basil, and pecorino.The final touch lies in the skilfull baking, which has to be a bit longer than usual, in order to additionally dry the crust, thus creating its signature crispiness and perfectly charred underside.

Next to pork, salsiccia can also include products made with beef, rabbit, and even seafood ingredients. They are usually heavily spiced with pepper, ground paprika, parsley, fennel, nutmeg, anise, coriander, while some even employ red wine.They can also differ in size, ranging from short and bulky to thin and long varieties.

These two mountain towns nestled in the Apennine peaks between the neighboring regions of Lazio and Abruzzo have long been known as home to semi-nomadic shepherds, who were often credited with inventing this simple sauce.While tending herds during their long months of transhumance, the shepherds usedguanciale(cured pork jowl) and tangy pecorino cheese tossed with pasta to prepare quick and humble meals likecacio e unto(lit. cheese and lard), as gricia sauce was once called.Even today, the list of ingredients goes no further than guanciale, pecorino, and black pepper — more than enough to result in the divine flavor of pasta alla gricia, which is typically served with bucatini, spaghetti, or rigatoni.

Their name is derived from the Italianamaro, meaningbitter, in reference to the sharp flavor of bitter almonds or apricot kernels, which are traditionally used in the recipe, together with egg whites and sugar.They can be made either dry and crispy, or soft and chewy—secchiormorbidi, respectively—though amaretti are today synonymous with the crispyamaretti di Saronnofrom the homonymous Lombardian town, commercialized by Lazzaroni family and often referred to as the original amaretti.Over time, they have become ubiquitous in Italy, and each region has its own version of the recipe, using different proportions of the basic ingredients or different stiffness of egg whites, temperatures, and times of baking, or additional ingredients such as egg yolks, flour, or leavening agents.Piedmont’s version,amaretti di Mombaruzzoare also crunchy and made exclusively with sugar, egg whites, sweet almonds, and apricot kernels, while the small town of Sassello in Liguria is renowned for their round-shaped, very soft and chewy amaretti, with almost marzipan-like interior, due to a very high percentage of almonds in the dough.Lombardy's version,amaretti di Gallarate, are also very soft, but irregularly shaped, whileamaretti Casperiani- from the province of Rieti - are made with hazelnuts instead of almonds.Amaretti di Carmigiano, also known asamaretti di Fochi, can be found in Tuscany - they are soft, imperfectly shaped, and smaller than the others, with characteristical amber color and strong almond aroma.In Lazio, soft and oval-shapedamaretti of Fiuggiandof Guarcinoare made with both sweet and bitter almonds, egg whites, and sugar, and they are traditionally placed on a disc of wafer paper. Also made with the combination of sweet and bitter almonds is Emilia-Romagna’s version,amaretti di Modena, which are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Regardless of the type, amaretti are an excellent after-meal snack that pairs perfectly with the sweet, almond flavored liqueur calledamaretto Disaronno, but they also go very well with a cup of coffee or Italian espresso.

Although polenta today is characterized by its intense yellow color,  before the arrival of corn in Europe in the 16th century, it was made with spelt, rye, and buckwheat, which gave it a much darker color.In Roman times, polenta was called pulmentum, and it was a staple of both peasants and Roman soldiers, who were given portions of grain as field rations. In Italy today, polenta is still made using a copper pot called a paiolo and a long wooden spoon known as a tarello.The boiled polenta is poured onto a flat surface or into a pan and left to cool and harden, and the cooled polenta cake is then traditionally cut into slices with a wooden knife or a cotton thread. Polenta is also characterized by its versatility; it can replace bread or pasta, it can serve as a side to fish or meat, or it can even be grilled and served with tomatoes and mushrooms.Despite its humble beginnings, in recent years, polenta has made a steady move towards gourmet audiences and high-end restaurants.

Although similar, the two dishes do differ slightly: the Viennese version is traditionally dipped in both flour and bread crumbs before being fried in oil, butter, or a combination of both, while the Milanese version is cooked bone-in and uses only bread crumbs and butter.It is often suggested that the similarities between these two culinary classics are not purely coincidental, as Milan was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the 17th and 18th century. However, when responding to any superficial comparison between the cotoletta and Wiener schnitzel, the Milanese will proudly point out that their dish has been a specialty of Milan and Lombardy since the 12th century.A recent Milanese invention is a version of the cotoletta calledl’orecchia di elefante(lit. elephant's ear) in reference to its size and shape, while the original version gets its name fromla costoletta- the cut of meat traditionally used to make it, a nearly inch-thick bone-in veal chop.

food_type=Rice-dishes
description=Risotto ai funghi, or mushroom risotto, is a classic Italian dish celebrated for its creamy texture and rich, earthy flavors.The dish begins with sautéing Arborio or Carnaroli rice in butter to lightly toast the grains.

Various types of mushrooms, such as porcini, shiitake, or button mushrooms, are used in the dish, enhancing its flavor. These mushrooms may be sautéed separately and added to the rice during cooking.Dried mushrooms can also be used after being rehydrated, with the soaking liquid strained and added to the risotto for additional mushroom flavor. The dish is typically finished with a generous amount of Parmesan cheese and butter stirred in off the heat, adding richness and a velvety texture.It may be garnished with fresh herbs like parsley to add color and freshness.

description=Pasta al forno is a classic Italian dish that translates to "baked pasta," and it is a hearty, comforting meal made by baking pasta with a variety of sauces, cheeses, and other ingredients. It is similar to timballo, a more elaborate and structured version, often involving additional elements and presentation.This dish is a staple in Italian households, often prepared for family gatherings, holidays, or Sunday meals, as it is easy to make in large quantities and can be customized to suit individual tastes. Traditionally, short pasta shapes like rigatoni, penne, ziti, or fusilli are used because they hold up well during baking and trap the sauce in their ridges and hollow centers.A rich tomato-based sauce, often a ragù made with ground beef, pork, or sausage, forms the foundation, while cheese, such as mozzarella, parmesan, pecorino, or ricotta, is layered to create gooey, golden layers. Some versions use béchamel sauce or combine it with the tomato sauce for added creaminess.Additional ingredients may include meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ham, or vegetables like eggplant or zucchini, depending on regional or family traditions. The pasta is cooked slightly under al dente, then mixed with the sauce and layered with cheese in a baking dish.Some versions involve layering the ingredients lasagna-style, while others mix everything together before baking. Breadcrumbs or grated parmesan are often sprinkled on top to create a golden, crispy crust. The dish is baked in the oven until bubbly and browned on top.Regional variations include the Sicilian version, which often features eggplant, hard-boiled eggs, and caciocavallo cheese, and the Neapolitan version, which commonly uses ziti or paccheri pasta, layered with meatballs, ricotta, and tomato sauce. In Northern Italy, variations may include béchamel sauce and a mix of local cheeses like fontina or taleggio.

Salt should be added carefully as pancetta is a part of this goulash, so it could become too salty if one doesn't pay attention.Once done, this hearty and thick goulash is typically served with runny polenta, canederli dumplings, or mashed potatoes and toasted bread on the side. It can also be served in a hollowed out loaf of bread, if desired. Südtiroler gulasch is typically served in shallow plates because there is not as much sauce as there is in other gulasch varieties.

Bigoli in salsa was originally consumed during fasting days such as Ash Wednesday, Christmas Eve, or Good Friday, and over the years it became a dish that is best consumed the night before a big feast, since it is both substantial and light enough to leave some space for the next day's feast.

This salad is one of the most important appetizers at the New Year's salad buffets in Russia, as well as in some of the other countries of the former USSR.The original was invented in the 1860s by Lucien Olivier, a chef in the popular Moscow restaurant calledL'Hermitage. Olivier guarded the recipe until he died, but it is believed that the recipe was stolen by an employee who watched the chef at work, so the salad is still made today.Another theory says that the recipe for the new Olivier salad was developed by one of the restaurant's customers who wanted to keep the salad alive after the chef passed away. Olivier salad as we know it today is nothing like the original version, because it was calledgame bird mayonnaise, made with gourmet ingredients such as black caviar, capers, hen, and crayfish tails.Over time, the salad evolved and most of the gourmet ingredients have been replaced with more common ones such as peas, chicken, ham, and pickles. Today, the variations are endless, but most Russian chefs agree on one thing: adding carrots to the Olivier is a heresy.Interestingly, Olivier salad is also sometimes called Russian salad, while the meatless version is calledFrench saladorfrancuska salata, probably due to the French name of its creator. The Spanish version is known as ensaladilla rusa.It is so popular in Spain that it's an important part of the Spanish gastronomy as well as being a staple in schools and summer camps all over the country. Ensaladilla rusa is also one of Spain's most popular tapas – in some cases, it's even served free of charge if you order a beer.There's also the Piedmonteseinsalata russa,typically consumed as an appetizer, and with many variations, so the salad might also include ingredients such as pickled cauliflower, anchovies, and tuna.

Although there is some dispute over the origin of this dish, it is mostly agreed upon that it was invented in 1967 by chef Enzo Francavilla in his Barese restaurant Al Sorso Preferito, which serves it to this day.This novel recipe spawned many variations, like the ones made with broccoli rabe and stracciatella cheese (Assassina di rape) or with squid and prawns (Assassina di mare), but the original is still one of the Barese best kept (and tastiest) secrets.Spaghetti all'assassina is served hot and can be garnished with fresh chili peppers.

The classic version is made with onions, celery, carrots, olive oil, a mixture of minced pork and beef, salsiccia, vegetable or beef stock, and white wine.Some versions can be made with chicken, wild boar, rabbit or even donkey and horse meat, and combinations of various different types of meat.

food_type=Pizzas
description=Canotto is a recent style of Italian pizza that's characterized by its inflated rim with giant bubbles inside. The crust must not be too dense or heavy as the cornicione (rim or edge) must be full of air. The secret for a puffy cornicione lies in the hydration, which must be around 70%.Unlike the simple yeast used for a traditional Neapolitan pizza, starters such as biga or poolish have a slower maturation time, and as a result, the dough is more digestible. The dough for Neapolitan pizza must be made the same day, while the dough for canotto pizza may be proofed for 48 or 72 hours in order to develop an airy structure with a unique aroma.The pizza is then topped with the desired ingredients and baked over high heat, just as the classic one. However, purist Neapolitan pizzaioli are determined not to consider the canotto as a true Neapolitan pizza, so the pizzaioli that make canotto often call it contemporary Neapolitan pizza.
