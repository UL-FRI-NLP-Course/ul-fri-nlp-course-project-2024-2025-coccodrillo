description=Most Brits would agree that there is nothing more British than fish and chips. This comforting, widely loved national dish consists of a freshly fried, hot, white fish fillet and large, sliced and fried potatoes. Cod, haddock, and flounder are the most common types of fish that is fried for the dish, and the customers can choose which type of fish they want, with cod being the most popular choice.The fillets get dipped in a batter made from eggs, milk, and flour, and are then fried in oil, lard, or beef drippings along with the potatoes. The origins of this dish go back to the 17th century, when potatoes were fried as a substitute for fish in the winter months, while fried fish was introduced into the country by Jewish refugees.Fish and chips are a favorite takeaway dish, with numerouschippies(fish and chips shops) popping up all over the country and offering a few accompaniments and sides, such as salt, vinegar, mushy peas, curry sauce, ketchup, brown sauce, and a cup of sweet, milky tea.Traditionally, the dish is served wrapped in greaseproof paper and a layer of newspaper in order to make eating outside easier, and if you want to do as the Brits do, it is the only acceptable way to eat it. Interestingly, in Yorkshire, a cup of tea is the perfect beverage pairing for fish and chips.

food_type=Offal
description=Haggis is a spicy mince, a type of pudding of high nutritional value made from sheep's innards, lamb's heart, lungs and liver, beef, onions, oats, and spices. It is the national dish of Scotland and an excellent source of fibre, iron, and carbohydrates.According to some, the wordhaggisstems from the French wordhacher, meaningto chop upormangle. Originally, it was a poor man's meal made with liver and kidneys stuffed in intestines, providing a good way to feed a lot of people so that no meat would go to waste.Its flavor can best be described as spicy, crumbly, earthy, meaty, savoury, peppery, moist, and oaty. There is also a vegetarian version of haggis containing various vegetables, mushrooms, oatmeal, onions, and seeds. The dish is an important part of theBurns Suppercelebrations that are held every year on January 25, in honor of Scotland's famous poet Robert Burns.He was the one that immortalised haggis in his poemAddress to a haggis. The dish is typically accompanied by turnips and mashed potatoes on the side. And even though some like to accompany the dish with Scotch whisky, one of Scotland's authorities on haggis and so-called ''Haggis Queen'' Jo Macsween claims that serving whisky with haggis is a recipe for a ''culinary catastrophe.''

food_type=Sweet-breads
description=Scone is a quick bread that is shaped into various forms such as squares, diamonds, and triangles, then baked in the oven. Although scones were griddle-baked and made with oats in the past, today they are traditionally made with wheat flour, baking powder or soda, butter, milk, sugar, and eggs.They can be either savory or sweet, consumed for breakfast, or served with afternoon tea. The most popular theory about their origin says they originated in Scotland in the early 1500s, the namesconesderived from the Stone of Destiny, where the Kings of Scotland used to be crowned.This theory is supported by the fact that the first known reference in print regarding scones appeared in 1513, in the poems of a Scottish poet. Today, most of the English scones are plain, relying on the addition of jam, lemon curd, or honey for extra flavor, but there are also some decadent varieties with cranberries, nuts, chocolate bits, and dates.

food_type=saltwater-fish-dishes
description=Fish and chips is a traditional dish consisting of freshly fried fish fillets and sliced fried potatoes. The fish is dipped in a batter of eggs, flour, and milk, and it’s then fried in oil, lard, or beef drippings. The most common types of fish used are cod, haddock, skate, and pollock, but cod is the most popular choice, with 60% of all fish and chips meals using it as the preferred fish.Cod has a texture that is very supple, tender, and mild, and it makes for a great contrast to the crispy-fried batter shell. In addition, its tender meat nicely absorbs the condiments and seasonings such as malt vinegar and salt. You can find fish and chips made with cod throughout the country, but it’s especially popular in southern seaside towns such as Hastings and Brighton.

food_type=Porridge
description=Enjoyed for centuries in Scotland and made from oats–one of the few grains that grow well in the country–Scottish porridge is a healthy and tasty dish containing high amounts of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Traditionally, the oatmeal is cooked in water with a pinch of salt, stirred clockwise (to fend off the Devil) with a wooden rod called aspurtlethat prevents the porridge from congealing.It is then served in wooden bowls while still hot. Sometimes, a bit of milk, dried fruits, and brown sugar are added as sweeteners. The dish should be eaten while standing up; a tradition left over from busy farmers who were simultaneously working and eating their breakfast.In the past, it used to be poured into aporridge drawerto cool down, and once it did, it would be cut up into thick slices that were easy to carry. It helps in reducing cholesterol and keeps one satiated and full of energy for a long time, so there is probably no better way to start the day than by eating a bowl of traditional Scottish porridge.

Today, they are mainly made on the griddle, and there are numerous regional variations that diverge from its simple origins: for instance, theSelkirk bannockis more like a lardy, raisin-studded fruitcake, while thePitcaithly bannockis a rich shortbread with candied fruit peel.

food_type=deep-fried-desserts
description=Deep-fried Mars bar is a famous Scottish delicacy and a champion of the jokingly-calledScottish Diet, where the rule is that sugar, fat, and alcohol must each account for at least 30% of a person's daily caloric intake. The unusual snack was invented in 1992 by the employees of theCarronfish bar in Stonehaven, a place where the popularfish and chipsare served, and the deep-fried Mars chocolate bar (nougat and caramel coated in milk chocolate) is made in the same oil that the fish and chips were fried in.However, this dessert became a Scottish tradition and was then copied in chip shops all across the country, and it even spread to Canada and Australia. One batter fits all - fish, chips, and the Mars bar. The batter is made by mixing milk, flour, and eggs.A chilled Mars bar is completely coated in batter, lowered into hot oil, then fried until the batter develops a golden brown color. It is a controversial delicacy, with mostly empty calories, high fat, and little nutritional value, but, as it turns out, the bars are delicious to some, as the savory flour mixes with the sugar, the batter elevates the crispy texture, and the salt and caramel meet on the palate, resulting in a delicious contrast of crispiness and chewiness.
