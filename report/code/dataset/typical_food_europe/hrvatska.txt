food_type=Stews
description=Brudet is one of the true classics of traditional Croatian cuisine. Prepared with a variety of seafood, this rustic stew is consumed along the entire Croatian coast. It is nearly impossible to find a unique brudet recipe, since every region, town, and household have their favorite version of the dish.General guidelines suggest that at least three different types of fish should be used – always cut into larger chunks and left on the bone. Scorpionfish, monkfish, sea bass, or any other white-fleshed fish is suitable for brudet. The addition of shellfish such as mussels and scampi is a desirable complement since they considerably contribute to the flavor.Brudet is usually cooked in large amounts in traditional pans with a heavy bottom. The fish is primarily fried with olive oil, onions, and garlic, and later braised in a flavorful broth which usually employs a combination of seafood stock, tomato sauce, and white or red wine, with the occasional addition of fresh tomatoes, chili peppers, and a touch of vinegar.Read more

description=Burek sa sirom is a phyllo pastry that is round or coil-shaped and filled with a mixture of cheese and eggs. The dough is made with flour, salt, and water (and perhaps a bit of oil) and stretched into translucent sheets. The sheets of phyllo dough are stacked in a large tray, and each sheet is sprinkled with oil or oil and mineral water and spread with the cheese and egg filling.Still, you might have heard that burek can only be called burek if it's filled with meat. That is, if you live in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but not everyone does, nor is burek really Bosnian – in fact, it has Turkish origins. In Bosnia, burek (with meat) and other types of similar pies such assirnica(cheese) andkrumpiruša(potatoes) are usually rolled into a coil, while Croatians and Serbs have a more relaxed approach – burek can be round and cut into quarters, or rolled into a coil – both shapes are good, and both can be called burek sa sirom (when filled with cheese, of course).Initially, burek was brought over to Niš in the 15th century, and it was prepared as a round pie. After World War II, burek came to Croatia and Slovenia. The termburek sa sirom, denoting a round or coil-shaped pie filled with cheese has been so engrained into Croatian culture (for more than 50 years) that it can be considered a Croatian classic regardless of its name.The most important thing is that it's delicious, filling, and a great breakfast staple for many Serbs and Croatians, especially when paired with a refreshing cup of yogurt on the side.
