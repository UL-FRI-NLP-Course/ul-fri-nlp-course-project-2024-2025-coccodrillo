food_type=Stews
description=Irish stewis a traditional folk stew that first appeared at the beginning of the 19th century and was developed out of necessity to make a meal out of available, leftover ingredients. Originally, the stew was made only with mutton, onions, potatoes, and sometimes barley, while lamb meat and other root vegetables like carrots, turnips, and parsnips were added later. It is said that goat meat was also used in the past, but besides the previously mentioned mutton and lamb, beef is a common addition in today's recipes.Given that the meat used in the dish is chewy and hard, usually bone-in, the stew is cooked slowly for a couple of hours so that the meat turns tender and releases the fat into the stew, thus enhancing the flavor of the entire dish. A stew made with Guinness stout has gained widespread popularity throughout Ireland as it intensifies the flavors and gives the broth a rich, brown color.Traditionally, the stew is consumed on St. Patrick's Day and for Samhain, an old Gaelic festival, but it can also be found on the menus of most Irish restaurants throughout the year.

food_type=soda-breads
description=Althoughsoda breadhas been known for centuries and was first invented by Native Americans, it was not until the 19th century that this type of bread became commonplace in Ireland. As a result of the potato famine, as well as Ireland's weather and geographical conditions, which allowed only the production of soft wheat that had low protein content, the Irish turned to soda bread as their main source of nutrition.There are only a few of ingredients needed to make the bread; flour, salt, baking soda, and buttermilk, but some recipes may also include olive oil and eggs. This bread requires almost no kneading, and the dough is shaped either as a round cake, or it is flattened and cut into four pieces, known asfarls.Depending on the type of flour used (whole wheat or plain), soda bread can be classified as brown or white, and is commonly consumed as an accompaniment to the main meal. If it is consumed for breakfast, the slices are traditionally spread with either butter or honey, or topped with cheese and cold cuts.

Originally, the breakfast was invented as a way to prepare the people for a day of hard work on the farm, and the meal was especially popular on cold winter mornings. Today, its huge size is making it somewhat impossible to consume on most working day mornings, so it is usually prepared on Sunday morning (or Christmas morning, when it's especially popular).Although it is called a breakfast, it can be consumed at any time of day. Key ingredients are not set in stone, so every household can add other ingredients according to their preference, such as mushrooms, baked beans, boxty, or hash browns.

It rose to prominence in the early 18th century with the establishment of the Cork Butter Exchange, which is still the largest butter market in the world. Today, Irish butter is generally considered a premium product and is often more expensive than other types of butter available in the market.

This salmon, which is certified as organic, is well-known for its firm flesh with low fat, and a color that reaches 14-15 on the Roche scale.Since the islanders have traditionally harvested the surrounding sea for centuries, these local skills were passed on from generation to generation and are now used to farm the native salmon in conditions which give this product its distinctive qualities.This is the reason why Clare Island Salmon is known as 'the closest farmed fish to wild salmon'. The salmon's superb flavor and lean texture make it popular both nationally and in the European market.

food_type=Lamb
description=Connemara Hill Lamb is lamb bred, born and reared in an area in the West of Ireland known internationally as Connemara. In the area, there are references from the 19th century about consuming this lamb when the blackface sheep that these lambs are from were imported from Scotland.The meat is from lambs between aged 14 to 32 weeks, some even 10 weeks old that weigh from 9 kg to 20 kg and is available on the market from July to January. The lambs are much lighter in weight than average Irish lambs. The meat is solid, rose red in color and lean with a light layer of fat.The lamb has a natural succulent flavor with a very distinctive aroma. This special taste can be attributed to their diet based on natural herbs, heathers and grasses unique to the region. All lambs are affixed with a special ear tag and carcass swing tag in order to ensure full traceability from farm to slaughter.Connemara Hill Lamb is a very valued meat in Ireland and beyond, and the best way to try it is in a traditional recipe - Connemara Lamb Stew.

The strawberries are so popular that they have their own festival in June.
