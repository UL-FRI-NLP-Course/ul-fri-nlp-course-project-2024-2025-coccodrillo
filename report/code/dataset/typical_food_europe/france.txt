description=These flaky, golden-colored, crescent-shaped pastries are best made with pure butter and a slightly sweet yeast dough. If made properly, the yellow-white interior should be just the slightest bit elastic when pulled from the center, ready to be covered with a pad of butter or some fresh jam.Experts agree that the croissant was heavily influenced by Austriankipfels. This pastry originated in 1683 as a celebration of the Austrian victory over the Ottoman Empire, its shape supposedly mimicking the crescent moon found on the Turkish flag.However, the croissant became French the moment people began to make it with puff pastry, a French innovation. Today, French croissants come filled with chocolate, jam, raisins, or even cream cheese. Sold fresh at numerous French boulangeries, they are mainly consumed as a breakfast item.

description=Probably the most iconic image of France, this long, light, airy bread with its characteristically crispy crust dates back to the 19th century, when wheat and white breads were no longer a privilege of the rich. Baguettes were made even before the invention of their name.The word baguette first entered use in 1920, derived from the Latin rootbaculum, meaningstickorstaff, which becamebacchetoin Italian. Baguettes were first baked as long, wide loaves of bread, but a 1920 law prevented workers from beginning work before 4AM, making it impossible for bakers to finish baking the bread in time for breakfast.They then gave baguettes their typical long, thin shape in order to speed up the baking process. The bread was baked in steam ovens, which were first brought to Paris by an Austrian named August Zang, whom some French sources credit with the invention of the baguette.Read more

Bisque was first mentioned as a shellfish soup in the 17th century, leading food historians to suggest that it was originally a fisherman’s dish that was designed to get the most flavor out of whatever ingredients were available.Today, the most popular version of the dish islobster bisque, which is made using a long cooking process designed to make the dish as flavorful as possible.

Many theories exist about the origin of this dessert, but the most likely one traces it back to the 13th century, when the chefs who first created the puff pastry in France and southern Germany began filling them with savory cheese mixtures and herbs.Sweet versions of the dish followed, and by the 17th century, the small pastries were referred to as choux (lit. cabbage), because the pastries were visually reminiscent of heads of cabbage. By the mid-19th century, the puffs had become known as profiteroles in France and England – they were decorated to resemble swans or pyramids, and were often served with dessert wine, tea, or coffee.Regardless of the pastry’s murky origins, one bite will be more than enough to answer your only real question – yes, they’re delicious.

A typical dessert of the Lorraine region, madeleines are said to have originated in Commercy.They are supposedly named after Madeleine Paulmier, the 18th-century pastry chef who first made them for Stanisław Leszczyński, the Duke of Lorraine. Later on, his daughter Marie Leszczyńska introduced madeleines to the court in Versailles, and they attained countrywide popularity soon afterward.However, what brought them worldwide fame is a passage fromSwann’s Way, the first volume of Marcel Proust’s 20th-century literary masterpieceIn Search of Lost Time. In painstaking detail, Proust describes biting into a soft little madeleine dipped in linden blossom tea, the taste of which then takes him on a bittersweet journey of nostalgia, evoking long-forgotten memories of his childhood and youth.Also known aspetite madeleines, these delicate little tea cakes are traditionally baked in shallow, scallop-shaped molds that give them their distinctive shell-like appearance.

Anything below €50 is considered an ordinary fish soup—a good rule of thumb for those who want to taste the real thing.What gives bouillabaisse both its unique flavor and its high price is the red scorpionfish—known in French asrascasseorscorpion de mer—a type of venomous rockfish found only in the Mediterranean. Other ingredients may include several varieties of whitefish, mussels, crabs, squid, and sometimes even lobster or eel.Another thing that makes Marseille's signature dish so distinctive is its vibrant orange color, as well as the flavors and aromas arising from a selection of Provençal herbs and spices, especially saffron, fennel, and orange zest. Delicately infused with white wine and anise liqueur, bouillabaisse is traditionally served in two courses: the thick, rich soup is enjoyed with rouille sauce and garlic-rubbed croutons or toasted bread, while the fish and shellfish are served separately.

description=Escargot, or cooked snails, are a beloved French delicacy that is usually served as an appetizer. Before preparation, the snails must be purged, removed from their shells, and cooked, usually with garlic butter, chicken stock, or wine. Their tender texture and clean, woody flavors pair especially nicely with herb-infused butter - garlic, thyme, and parsley are the most common choices.Cooked escargots can be served on toasted pieces of baguette, but they are more commonly placed back into their shells and served on an escargot plate. In that case, special snail tongs are needed to hold the shell while extracting the meat with a two-pronged snail fork.

description=Beef bourguignon is a rich and complex stew originating from the region of Burgundy in France. The star of the dish is a robust red Burgundy wine, which is used to soften and tenderize tough cuts of Charolais beef, along with savory additions such as carrots, onions, garlic, thyme, and mushrooms.The ingredients are simmered for a long time until the meat is completely soft and succulent, and all the juices have blended into a hearty, dark sauce. Some say that the dish tastes even better after it has been refrigerated for 24 hours and then reheated.Beef bourguignon dates back to the Middle Ages, when the slow-cooking process was used to soften tougher cuts of meat using only the ingredients that were readily available. Pairing a serving of beef bourguignon with a full-bodied red Burgundy makes for a true gourmet delight.

The meat is usually served thinly sliced and still slightly pink on the inside.The cut of the breast usually comes from the mulard duck, a cross between the Pekin and the Muscovy duck. This breed is raised for foie gras, so its breast meat is thicker and more flavorful than that of other duck breeds. In the mid-1960s, rare duck breast became extremely popular in the United States thanks to Robert Daley, an American journalist who praised Daguin’s specialty in The New York Times.Today, magret de canard can be found on tables throughout France, both in restaurants and private homes.

The creamy base is traditionally made with mayonnaise, though some variations occasionally may opt for crème fraiche, while the optional additions usually include spices and mostly chopped parsley, chervil, tarragon, capers, and pickles.Optionally, boiled egg yolks can also be added. Although the sauce was named after Tatars—the Turkic-speaking ethnic group from Central Asia—it is not related to the region or the people. The name probably appeared as a reference to the coarse texture of the sauce—since the Tatars were known for their barbarian behavior.The sauce was also initially served as an accompaniment tosteak tartare, which is made with finely chopped raw beef or horse meat, and the dish probably influenced the origin of the name.

description=This elaborately decorated, rolled, and filled sponge cake is frosted with chocolate buttercream made to look like a tree bark. Some of the decorations might include marzipan sticks, sugar cobwebs, and meringue mushrooms. The origins of the cake can be traced back to the old Celtic tradition of celebrating the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year.The Celts would burn a log as an offering to the Sun for returning to Earth. As the tradition disappeared with the arrival of home stoves, the huge log was replaced by a small branch that was traditionally set in the middle of the dining table, surrounded by delicacies and sweets that were given to guests as treats.Over time, the branch transformed into the Yule log cake we know today, but whether it was a Parisian or Lyonnaise creation is still the subject of heated debate. What we do know is that Parisian bakers helped popularize it in the 19th century, and that the oldest written reference to the cake can be found in a tome calledThe English Huswifethat dates back to 1615.Since then, it has become the most popular traditional Christmas cake throughout France, and it is made in a wide variety of colors and flavors.

This unique cooking method helps trap steam inside the paper packets, allowing for the food to cook in its juices and retain all the flavors, aromas, and nutrients.Food prepared this way comes out moist, tender, and packed with flavor. Traditionally, the food is enclosed in parchment paper, though aluminum foil or paper bags are often used instead. Cooking en papillote is typically done in an oven, but a steamer, a metal plate, or even a grill may also be used.A wide variety of foods may be prepared using this technique, though seafood, vegetables, and poultry are said to deliver the best results. Other typical ingredients that are often cooked en papillote include certain types of cheese, eggs, pasta dishes, mushrooms, desserts, and various dough-based specialties.Although it usually does not require the addition of oil or other liquids, this technique may optionally call for a drizzle of oil, wine, vinaigrette, lemon juice, or soy sauce, depending on the food that is being cooked.

description=This simplest version of this French sauce is nothing more than a base of mayonnaise mixed with herbs, capers, pickles, and a few optional drops of anchovy oil. The word rémoulade is thought to have originated from the word remolat, the word for “horseradish” in the dialect spoken in France’s Picardy region, as the original version of the sauce may have been made with the spicy root.In France, rémoulade stars most famously as the dressing for céleri rémoulade, a simple salad made with julienned celery root. While it was originally served as a sauce with meat dishes, today it is found far more often alongside fish.A regional variation of the sauce is heavily used in Louisiana Creole cuisine.

description=Simply put, this French classic is a stew-like dish of boiled meat and vegetables. However, it is not as simple as it might appear at first glance. Pot-au-feu, French for “pot on fire”, is one of the oldest French peasant winter dishes.It was originally made over an open fire with cheap, inferior cuts of meat, vegetables such as potatoes, onions, carrots, leeks and turnips, and whatever other ingredients were available. The result was a savory stew that helped one make it through the cold season.The use of tough cuts of meat and low cooking temperature means a long cooking time to make the meat tender, sometimes even an entire day. The dish is traditionally considered finished when the broth gets a gelatinous texture. As it is one of the most popular dishes in France, every region expectedly has its own twist on the dish, however, the common thread among all of them is that the broth is served first and the meat second.With its wonderful aromas and succulent, tender meat, a serving of pot-au-feu paired with a glass of dry red wine is an authentic experience that is more than worth the time invested in preparing it.

In some cases, it can be cut into steaks, but these will typically be less tender than steaks cut from more marbled sections of the cow.
