description=The Kakhuri Ghoi pig, an indigenous breed from the Kakheti region of Georgia, is known for its easy domestication and adaptability to local environments. Thanks to the history of decline starting in the 1930s due to crossbreeding in Soviet farms aimed at increasing productivity, this breed suffered from a dilution of its unique biological characteristics.Characterized by their elongated snout and rough bristles, Kakhuri Ghoi pigs are typically black or dark grey, though red variants also exist. Adult sows weigh 50-70 kg, while boars reach 100-120 kg. These pigs, which can forage in the forest without needing additional food, especially during summer, have low husbandry costs for farmers.They farrow once a year, producing litters of 6 to 7 striped piglets, with a sow's milking capacity reaching 20 to 25 liters. The Kakhuri Ghoi pig is valued for its meat, a staple in various hot Georgian dishes, and is used to produce smoked ham. This breed is particularly noted for its adaptability to the local environment and ability to thrive on the sparse vegetation in its native habitat.As with many traditional livestock breeds, the Kakhuri Ghoi pig faces challenges from modernization and the shift towards more commercially viable breeds. Efforts to preserve such native breeds are important for maintaining agricultural diversity, protecting genetic resources, and preserving cultural traditions associated with local cuisines and farming practices.

It is mainly found in Kakheti, where it is used in varietals and blends and several regional appellations.Although suitable for various styles, it is primarily used for dry wines and traditional wines made in qvevri—terracotta pots used for fermentation and maturation. Dry white wines made from Mtsvane are fresh and light. They will usually have aromas reminiscent of white and yellow fruit, flowers, and citrus, often accompanied by herbal and mineral notes.Qvevri-made wines have a slightly darker, amber color, more body, and juicier aromas often similar to orange zest, apricots, and spices. Manavi and Tsinandali are the most popular Georgian appellations that use Mtsvani. Confusingly, this variety is one of many Georgian grapes named Mtsvane.They are not genetically identical, and typically region is added to the name to signifying their origin. Dry wines pair with salads, appetizers, and snacks, while qvevri wines may be a good match with pork, poultry, and spicy dishes.
