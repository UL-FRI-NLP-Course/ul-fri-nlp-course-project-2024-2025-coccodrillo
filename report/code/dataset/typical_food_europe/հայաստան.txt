description=Lavash is a traditional flatbread claimed by many food specialists to be Armenian in origin, but it is well-known and prepared throughout Western Asia (most noteably Iran and Türkiye) and the Caucasus (most noteably Azerbaijan).The dough consists of wheat flour, salt, and water leavened only with a sourdough starter. Once the dough has risen, it is shaped into small lumps that are rolled flat and then slapped against the inside of a clay oven calledtonir.Depending on the part or region of Armenia, these flatbreads can vary in thickness, size, shape, and the method of kneading. Because the process of making lavash is so labor-intensive, as well as time-consuming, this flatbread is typically prepared in advance.Read more

description=Even though lahmacun is popularly nicknamedTurkish pizza, it's origin is disputed and can be traced to Armenia, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkiye. It can be found at numerous street stalls as well as in virtually any traditional restaurant, but also in kebab eateries where they typically serve mini lahmacuns as appetizers.The perfect lahmacun is made by rolling a ball of sturdy semolina dough into a thin disc which is only lightly spread with meat - either lamb or beef, minced to a paste together with chili, onions, and other seasonings. The dish is then shortly baked in a super-hot (and preferably wood-fired) oven.Lahmacun is best served hot with a drizzle of lemon juice. It is traditionally enjoyed folded around the crispy onions and a parsley salad known aspiyaz. It is recommended to pair lahmacun either with the salty, cold yogurt beverage calledayran, orşalgam suyu, the barrel-fermented juice of red carrot pickles, which is salted, spiced, and flavored with the aromatic turnip calledçelem.

Even though it is believed that sig’s production is on the decline and it might be an endangered species, the fish is widely consumed to this day, and it can be prepared in various ways, including oven-fried sig or sig that is soaked in tomato-paprika sauce and then grilled.

food_type=brandies
description=Named after the eponymous mountain in Yerevan,Araratis the most famous Armenian brandy. Ararat was first introduced in 1887, and it was mainly modeled on the famed French cognac-making tradition. Although Armenian producers copied French methods, the combination of spring water from the Katnaghbyur source, climate, and native grapes influenced the creation of a brandy that has been praised for its excellent quality and a unique character.The brandy is exclusively produced from local Armenian grapes that are grown in Ararat Valley, and it is aged for at least three years in centuries-old Caucasian oak casks. Depending on the age of the blend, Ararat can be labeled differently, while specialty blends also carry various designations.Ararat brandy usually displays aromas and flavors of dried fruit, vanilla, and dried herbs. It is recommended to serve it neat or over ice, preferably in a snifter glass, but it also incorporates well into various cocktails. From its beginnings, Armenian brandy was labeled ascognacorkanyak, but since the European Union officially forbade the name, Armenian brandy is now labeled asarbun.However, in Armenia, virtually everyone sticks to its original name. Although it was never confirmed, the most popular legend relating to Ararat claims that Winston Churchill ordered copious amounts of the brandy after Joseph Stalin offered it to him at the Yalta Conference in 1944.
