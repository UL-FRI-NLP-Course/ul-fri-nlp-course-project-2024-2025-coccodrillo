In the Netherlands, appeltaart is usually served at room temperature and topped with a dollop of whipped cream, what is known asappeltaart met slagroom.This traditional dessert is one of the first pies that the young people learn to prepare in the Netherlands, but it is believed that the best ones are made by grandmas.

description=Huzarensalade is a Dutch take on the Olivier salad. What belongs in this salad and what doesn't is a controversial issue, but it's usually prepared with a combination of potatoes, tart apples, gherkins, gherkin juice, carrots, shallots, ham or cooked veal or beef, mayonnaise, peas, and seasonings.The vegetables are cooked and combined with the rest of the ingredients, and the salad is then typically chilled before it's garnished and served. It is named after the salad the Hussars (Hungarian cavalry) used to prepare. They usually went behind enemy lines and weren't noticed by the enemy, so they used pre-cooked food and mixed it on the spot in order to make this salad.Huzarensalade is served as a salad that accompanied barbecued meat, and it is commonly served buffet-style for Christmas or New Year's Eve.
