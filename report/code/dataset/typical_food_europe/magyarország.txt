description=This Hungarian specialty is prepared with meat, traditionally beef, that is simmered in a rich paprika-infused broth, usually alongside onions, bell peppers, root vegetables, various spices, and occasionally tomatoes (in some regional variations).Gulyás is a well-known dish that enjoys immense popularity even outside the Hungarian borders. In many countries, the word is synonymous with a thick stew, while in Hungary, gulyás mostly represents a soup-like dish, which is why this dish is also known as gulyásleves (lit. herdsman soup).It closely resembles pörkölt—a thick Hungarian stew consisting of meat, onions, and selected spices—which is what most people outside of Hungary associate with the word gulyás (goulash). They both originated as traditional, rustic dishes that appeared in their modern-day form in the 18th century when paprika became a commonly used spice.In Hungary, gulyás is traditionally served accompanied by csipetke pasta or bread and is mainly enjoyed as a hearty main course.

Even though there are numerous semmelknödel varieties, which come in various sizes, they all have a recognizable round form and employ bread as the base ingredient.Sliced or diced bread pieces, which can be fried in oil, are usually soaked in plain milk to soften, then mixed with eggs to form a pliable, soft base. Since they are incredibly neutral on their own, bread dumplings are usually mixed with different spices and additional ingredients to form a myriad of flavorful varieties.They commonly include onions and fresh herbs such as parsley or marjoram, but can even withstand strong flavors coming from nutmeg or fresh lemon zest. Even though semmelknödel are mostly served as a complement to various roast meat dishes and stews, they can be enjoyed as a nourishing dish on their own, usually served alongside vegetables and lentils, or doused in creamy mushroom sauces.Various dumplings are omnipresent in many European cuisines, but the invention of semmelknödel has usually been associated with the German region of Bavaria, from where it spread to other parts of Germany and countries such as Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.

description=The powdered Szegedi paprika spice is made by grinding the pods of the pepper plants. Its colour is a vivid, fiery red and its aroma is strong and spicy, similar to those of baked vegetables. Once tasted, the flavour is sweet, mellow and spicy but pleasant and not too hot, due to the fact that the capsaicin amount is not above 100mg/kg.In some hotter varieties of Szegedi paprika, the capsaicin amount is higher, so the paprika is also a lot hotter in taste. It is so popular in Hungary that it even has its own museum, and is typically used as a seasoning in hearty stews, goulash or sprinkled on meat.However, it is not merely a spice for the Hungarian people - it is the very core of their cuisine, adding that tinge of red colour to almost every dish and making it just a little bit more interesting.
