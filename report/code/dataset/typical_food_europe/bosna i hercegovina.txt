description=Despite their clear Turkish provenance, Bosnian ćevapi are a source of great national pride and the country's favorite dish. These tiny, hand-rolled minced meat sausages are commonly made with ground beef - or a mix of beef mince with other meats such as veal or lamb - seasoned with a mix of different spices; usually garlic, salt, black pepper, and sometimes paprika or hot red pepper flakes.After they have mellowed for a couple of hours, ćevapi are barbecued over charcoal. Traditionally, one portion of the dish consists of ten pieces of ćevapi tucked in a soft, moist, slightly grilled flatbread calledlepinjaorsomun, and a variety of accompaniments such askajmak, a type of clotted cream spread, roasted red pepper and eggplant relish calledajvar(especially popular in Croatia and Serbia), and raw onions.

description=Burek consists of layers of phyllo dough stuffed with various savory fillings. Despite its Turkish origins, this dish has evolved into a proud gem of Bosnian national cuisine. Although most locals claim that only burek with ground beef can be called burek, the same dish also appears with other fillings, and these other varieties are known by different names:sirnica(cottage cheese),zeljanica(spinach), andkrompiruša(potatoes).Burek is baked rolled into a snail-like shape and this type is typically found in bakeries, while traditional restaurants often make it in the form of a pie, which is sliced into quarters before serving. The dish is wildly popular all across the Balkans, though in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the cultural significance of this everyday staple is incomparable and best summed up in a number of local proverbs suggesting that if a woman can make a good burek, she's eligible for marriage.

description=Peka orsaćis an ancient technique of preparing various dishes inside the eponymous bell-shaped cooking vessel. The technique is mostly used for the preparation of meat, vegetables, or seafood that are seasoned and cooked together with olive oil, other types of fat, herbs, and occasionally wine.The dome-shaped lid is put on top, and the whole vessel is then placed in an outdoor fireplace, while the lid is covered with hot embers. This preparation technique allows the ingredients to cook slowly and keeps all the flavors and aromas intact.Peka was once a staple method of preparation that was common throughout Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia, used not only for cooking meat, but for baking bread, pastries, or cakes. It is believed it initially appeared as an adaptation of primitive techniques for baking ingredients covered in clay, and later as an affordable option in households that could not afford ovens.Read more

description=Bosanski lonac orBosnian potis a traditional, flavorful stew consisting of layers of large and chunky pieces of meat and vegetables that are covered with water and slowly simmered in a big pot.

The traditional clay pot (lonac) that the stew is cooked in is such an important part of the dish that the whole dish is named after it.The pot was created in the Middle Ages by coal miners, and since Bosnia has long been a mining country, the miners were forced to prepare their own dishes, so while working, they would leave the stew to simmer until their lunch break.

description=Trnjakis a rare grape variety that is cultivated in Herzegovina and Central Dalmatia (Zagora). In Herzegovina, Trnjak was mainly grown together with Blatina—a grape that only has functional female flowers and needs other grape varieties to pollute.Often both types would be used in blends, but recently, Trnjak has been used in the production of exceptional and well-balanced varietal wines. The best expressions of varietal Trnjak are aromatic, dense, and complex with typical notes of ripe red fruit and spices.Trnjak pairs well with charcuterie, cheese, lamb, veal, and hearty stews.
