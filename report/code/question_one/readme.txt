This folder is to the script that answer at the first question like:

"Tell me the best place in {city}. I will stay here {n} days."

The script find_best_places.py is only for place to visit(not resturants)
If we want insert also resturants at lunch or dinner or break in afternoon is possible becuase the script calculate the time from the start place and we can calculate (about( the lunch time or dinner time) and insert the best place to eat that is close the last place before the lunch(or dinner) break.
