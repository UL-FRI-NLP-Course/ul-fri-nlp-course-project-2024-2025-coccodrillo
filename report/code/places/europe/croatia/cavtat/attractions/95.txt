Baltazar Bogišić Collection | Cavtat, Croatia |  The former Rector’s Palace houses the rich library belonging to 19th-century jurist and sociologist Baltazar Bogišić (1834–1908), as well as an archaeological collection including Roman inscriptions and amphorae. However the main attraction here is a collection of paintings by Bogišić's contemporary Vlaho Bukovac, including a large canvas depicting the Cavtat Carnival.
