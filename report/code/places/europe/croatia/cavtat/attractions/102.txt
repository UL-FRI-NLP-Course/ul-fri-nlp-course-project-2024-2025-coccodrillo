St Nicholas' Church | Cavtat, Croatia |  Peek inside this 15th-century church to view its impressive wooden altars and the accomplished Bukovac paintings of the four evangelists on either side of the sanctuary. Cavtat landmarks feature prominently in much of the art, including in the 19th-century altarpiece by Carmelo Reggi and in the Stations of the Cross that line the walls.
