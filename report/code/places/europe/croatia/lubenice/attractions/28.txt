Lubenice Beach | Cres Island, Croatia |  One of Kvarnerâ€™s most remote and beautiful beaches, this secluded cove is accessed by following a steep path through the scrub. The 45-minute descent is a breeze, but coming back up is more of a challenge (you might want to take a taxi boat from Valun or Cres).
