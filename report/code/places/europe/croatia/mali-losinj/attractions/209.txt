Sea Turtle Rescue Centre | Mali Lo≈°inj, Croatia |  Small but extremely interesting, this centre is dedicated to rehabilitating injured sea turtles, most of which have been entangled in plastic or fishing nets. There aren't a lot of displays, but the staff on hand will talk you through the centre's work. You might even get to see some of the patients. It's located between the Adriatic and Vespera hotels, just up from the promenade.
