Franciscan Monastery | Elafiti Islands, Croatia |  The first sight of Lopud when sailing into the harbour, this beautiful 15th-century complex has an immense seawall and 30m-high bell tower. The monastery is off limits to the public, but St Mary-of-the-Cave Church (built in 1483) is occasionally open and worth a visit for its 16th-century altar piece and intricately carved choir chairs.
