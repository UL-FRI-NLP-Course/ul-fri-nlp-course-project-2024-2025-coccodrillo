St Nicholas' Church | Elafiti Islands, Croatia |  Dedicated to the patron saint of sailors, St Nicholas attests to the times when Lopud was an important seafaring centre. Positioned on the waterfront, this 1482 church is fairly modest in content, but provides an airy environment for a quiet moment.
