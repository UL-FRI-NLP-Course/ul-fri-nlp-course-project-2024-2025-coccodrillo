St Euphemia's Church | Rovinj, Croatia |  Built from 1725 to 1736, this imposing structure – the largest baroque church in Istria – dominates Rovinj from its hilltop location in the middle of the old town. Its 61m-high bell tower is older than the present church; construction commenced in 1654 and lasted 26 years. It's modelled on the campanile of St Mark’s in Venice, and is topped by a 4m copper statue of St Euphemia, who shows the direction of the wind by turning on a spindle.
Inside the church, there are various notable artworks and ceiling frescoes above the sanctuary.The body of St Euphemia is said to rest in the ancient Roman sarcophagus behind the right-hand altar. Rovinj’s patron saint was tortured for her faith by the Emperor Diocletian before being thrown to the lions in AD 304. Her body was kept in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) until the 7th century, when it was removed to protect it from iconoclasts. According to local legend, it then appeared off the coast of Rovinj in a spectral boat. The townspeople were unable to budge the heavy sarcophagus until a small boy appeared with two calves and moved it to the top of the hill.
