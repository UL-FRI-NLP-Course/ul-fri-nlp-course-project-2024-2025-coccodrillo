Batana Ecomuseum | Rovinj, Croatia |  This tiny museum is dedicated to the batana, a flat-bottomed fishing boat that stands as a symbol of Rovinjâ€™s seafaring and fishing traditions. Although there are some multimedia displays, most captions are in Croatian and Italian only; if you read neither, you're unlikely to need more than 10 minutes here.
