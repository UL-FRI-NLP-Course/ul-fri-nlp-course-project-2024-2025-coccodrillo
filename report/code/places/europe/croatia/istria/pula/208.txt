Roman Floor Mosaic | Pula, Croatia |  One of the intriguing things about Pula is the way that Roman relics pop up in the most unlikely of places. This remarkably well-preserved 3rd-century floor mosaic is hidden behind a car park on Flaciusova (look for the brown signs). In the midst of geometric motifs is a central panel depicting bad girl Dirce from Greek mythology being punished by being tied to the horns of a bull.
