Ruta | Cres Island, Croatia |  This local collective promotes the islandâ€™s cultural tradition of wool weaving and felting. Using the discarded wool of indigenous Cres sheep, the craftspeople make wonderful slippers, hats, handbags and clothes. If you're lucky enough to find someone here you can see the workshop, learn about felting and maybe even try it yourself.
