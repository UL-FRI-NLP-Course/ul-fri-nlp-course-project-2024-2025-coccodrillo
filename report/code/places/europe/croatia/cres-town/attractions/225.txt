St Mary of the Snow Church | Cres Island, Croatia |  Just inside the main harbour gate, this church is notable for its Renaissance portal with a relief of the Virgin and Child. A glassed-in foyer allows you to peer inside, but the church is only open during Mass. If you do find it open, look for the carved wooden piet√† from the 15th century (now under protective glass) at the left altar.
