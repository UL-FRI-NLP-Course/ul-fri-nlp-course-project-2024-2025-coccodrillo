Grgić Vina | Pelješac Peninsula, Croatia |  Perched dramatically on a headland above the pretty village of Trstenik, this impressive winery is run by the family of Napa Valley winemaker Mike Grgich. The tasting charge allows you to sample both of the wines they produce (plavac mali and pošip) and antipasti platters are available. You're best to call ahead in winter.
