Motovun: A History in Motion | Motovun, Croatia |  Tucked away in a courtyard of the Hotel Ka≈°tel, this small museum has interesting displays on the legendary giant of Motovun Forest, the grim lot of the local peasants forced to work as rowers on Venetian galleons, the truffle and olive-oil industries, the film festival, and Motovun-born motor-sport legend Mario Andretti.
