St Mark's Church | Cres Island, Croatia |  The parish church houses the village's main sight: the 11th-century Valun Tablet. Inscribed in both Glagolitic and Latin, this tombstone reflects the ethnic composition of the island at the time it was made. At that point, Cres was inhabited by Roman descendants and newcomers who spoke Croatian. Sadly, the church's opening hours are erratic.
