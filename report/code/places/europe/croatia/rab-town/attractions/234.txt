St Anthony the Abbot's Church | Rab Island, Croatia |  At the eastern tip of the old town, this church attached to a still-operating Franciscan convent has lots of inlaid marble and a carving of a seated St Anthony decorating the altar. It's the final resting place of St Marin of Rab, whose statue graces a beautifully landscaped park below, a relaxing stop during a sightseeing tour.
