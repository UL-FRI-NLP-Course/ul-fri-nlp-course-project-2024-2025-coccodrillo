St Mary's Campanile | Rab Island, Croatia |  Dating from the 12th century, this is Rabâ€™s tallest bell tower and one of the most beautiful on the entire Croatian coast. The 26m edifice is topped with an octagonal pyramid surrounded by a Romanesque balustrade, and features a cross with five small globes and reliquaries of several saints. Climb up the very steep wooden staircase for glorious views over old-town rooftops and sea. You'll emerge right by the chiming mechanism itself.
