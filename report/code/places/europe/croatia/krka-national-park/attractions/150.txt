Mother of Mercy Franciscan Monastery | Krka National Park, Croatia |  Upstream of Skradinski Buk waterfall the Krka River broadens into Lake Viskovac, a habitat for marsh birds. At its centre is a tree-fringed island, the perfect place for a monastery. Founded in the 14th century by Augustinian hermits, the monastery was expanded in 1445 by Franciscans escaping the Ottoman invasion of Bosnia. The church was extensively remodelled in the 17th century and the bell tower added in 1728. Boat trips head here from Skradinski Buk and include 30 minutes on the island.
