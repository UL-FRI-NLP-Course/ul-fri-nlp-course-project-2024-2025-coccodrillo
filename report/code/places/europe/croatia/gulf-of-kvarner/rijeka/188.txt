St Vitus' Cathedral | Rijeka, Croatia |  North of Rijeka's Roman Arch is this unusual round cathedral, built by the Jesuit order in 1638 on the site of an older church and dedicated to Rijekaâ€™s patron saint. If it looks familiar, it's probably because it features on the reverse of the 100KN note. Massive marble pillars support the central dome, under which are housed baroque altars and a 13th-century Gothic crucifix.
