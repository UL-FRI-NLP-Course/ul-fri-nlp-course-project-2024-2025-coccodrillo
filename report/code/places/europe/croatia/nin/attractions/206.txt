Church of the Holy Cross | Northern Dalmatia, Croatia |  This appealing little pre-Romanesque white church, often called 'the smallest cathedral in the world' in recognition of its role as the ancient seat of bishops, dates to the 9th century. Before the 14th century it was used as a royal chapel, although it remains pleasingly unadorned. The windows are perfectly placed to allow the sun's rays to enter and the church to act as a sundial.
