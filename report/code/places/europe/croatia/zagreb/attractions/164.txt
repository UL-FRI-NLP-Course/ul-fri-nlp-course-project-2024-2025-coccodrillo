Tortureum | Zagreb, Croatia |  Horror buffs will love the display of 70-plus full-scale historic instruments of torture. But seeing, touching and trying out the 1792 guillotine replica, pendulum, rack or iron maiden gives more than a sensationalist take on violence. Experiencing the museum's multisensory rooms, such as the semidark Cabinet of Wonders or the Dungeon, allows an idea of the terror these instruments once wielded.
