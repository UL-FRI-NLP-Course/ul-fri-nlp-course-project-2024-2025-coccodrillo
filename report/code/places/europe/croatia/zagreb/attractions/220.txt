Jesuit Church of St Catherine | Zagreb, Croatia |  This fine baroque church was built between 1620 and 1632. Although battered by fire and earthquake, the facade still gleams and the interior (only open during Mass) contains a fine altar dating from 1762. The interior stucco work dates from 1720. Look for the 18th-century medallions depicting the life of St Catherine on the ceiling of the nave.
