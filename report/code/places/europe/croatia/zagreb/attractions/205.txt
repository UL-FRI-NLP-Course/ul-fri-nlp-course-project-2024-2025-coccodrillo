Sabor | Zagreb, Croatia |  The eastern side of Trg Svetog Marka is taken up by the Croatian sabor (parliament), built in 1910 on the site of baroque 17th- and 18th-century town houses. Its neoclassical style is quite incongruous on the square, but the historical importance of this building is undeniable – Croatia’s secession from the Austro-Hungarian Empire was proclaimed from its balcony in 1918.
