Medieval Monastery Mediterranean Garden | Šibenik, Croatia |  Designed and completed by award-winning landscape artist Dragutin Kiš, this tiny recreated medieval garden has a formal layout, with herbs and medicinal plants in neat borders between pathways in the shape of a cross. The attached cafe is a pleasant place to stop for an ice-cream sundae or coffee and cake before you continue your ascent to the fortress.
