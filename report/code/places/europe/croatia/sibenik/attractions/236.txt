Šibenik City Museum | Šibenik, Croatia |  Housed in the 17th-century Rector’s Palace, this well-curated museum focuses on the city and its surrounds. The permanent collection of artefacts dating from prehistory to the end of the Venetian period is split into four clear periods. There are English translations throughout and the odd bit of video to spice things up.
