Milna & Zaglav | Vis Island, Croatia |  While the rest of the island is rocky or pebbly, Vis' eastern end has a few sandy beaches. Milna sits right beside the main road, a sandy beach with strikingly blue water and several small islands forming an idyllic backdrop. However, you're better off taking a 15-minute walk along the shrub-lined path at the southern end of the beach to neighbouring Zaglav, which is even prettier and quieter. Sadly, both beaches seem to attract rubbish washing in from the sea.
