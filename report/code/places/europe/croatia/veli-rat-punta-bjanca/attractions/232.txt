Punta Bjanca Lighthouse | Northern Dalmatia, Croatia |  Close to the northern tip of Dugi Otok you'll find Punta Bjanca lighthouse (built 1849). At 42m, it's the largest such beacon on the Adriatic. A small chapel dedicated to St Nicholas, patron saint of sailors, is positioned nearby. As the lighthouse faces nearly due west, it's hard to imagine a more sublime spot to watch a sunset.
