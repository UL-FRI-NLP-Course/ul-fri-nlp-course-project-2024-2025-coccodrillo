City Bell Tower | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  Marking the eastern end of the old town’s main drag, this slender dome-capped tower has a large curvy clock face known as ‘the octopus’ and a two-tonne bell struck by two bronze jacks named Maro and Baro.
Beating the clock today are two replicas; the 15th-century originals are exhibited in the Rector’s Palace.
