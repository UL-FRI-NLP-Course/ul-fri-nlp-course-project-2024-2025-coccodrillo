Aquarium | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  Showcasing flora and fauna of the Adriatic Sea, Dubrovnik's aquarium might be modest in content and overpriced, but set in the cool stone vaults of Fort St Johnâ€™s ground floor, it makes for a lovely escape from the scorching heat and crowds, especially if you've got kids in tow. It's run by the University of Dubrovnik's Institute for Marine & Coastal Research, and serves as a rehabilitation centre for injured sea turtles.
