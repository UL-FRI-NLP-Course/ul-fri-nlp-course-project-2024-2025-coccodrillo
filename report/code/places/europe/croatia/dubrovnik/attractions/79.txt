Pulitika Studio | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  In a small, cavelike room in the Fort St John, the former studio of the painter Đuro Pulitika (1922–2006) looks like a moment paused in time, with his work displayed everywhere and his reading glasses casually forgotten on the side table. The larger front room often hosts exhibitions by local artists.
The studio is not very well signed; look for it near the entry to the Maritime Museum.
