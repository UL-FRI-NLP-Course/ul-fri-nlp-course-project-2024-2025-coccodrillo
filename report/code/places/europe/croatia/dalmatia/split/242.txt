Amphitheatre | Split, Croatia |  Salona's huge 2nd-century amphitheatre was partly destroyed in the 17th century by the Venetians to prevent it from being used as a refuge by Turkish raiders. At one time it could accommodate 18,000 spectators, which gives an idea of the size and importance of ancient Salona.
