Porta Caesarea | Split, Croatia |  This 1st-century eastern city gate was later engulfed by Salona as the city spread eastwards. Grooves in the stone road left by ancient wheels can still be seen here, along with the remains of a covered aqueduct that ran along the top of the wall. It, too, was probably built around the 1st century AD and supplied Salona and Diocletianâ€™s Palace with water from the Jadro River.
