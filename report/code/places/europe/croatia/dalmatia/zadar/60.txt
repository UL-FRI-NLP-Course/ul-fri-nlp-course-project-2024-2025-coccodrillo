St Simeon’s Church | Zadar, Croatia |  While this 17th-century baroque church is pretty enough, it's what lies inside that makes it truly noteworthy. Taking pride of place above the main altar, the sarcophagus of St Simeon is a masterpiece of medieval goldsmithery. Commissioned in 1377, the coffin is made of cedar and covered inside and out with finely executed gold-plated silver reliefs.
The middle relief, showing the presentation of Jesus to Simeon at the temple, is a copy of Giotto’s fresco from Cappella dell’Arena in Padua, Italy. Other reliefs depict scenes from the lives of the saints and King Ludovic’s visit to Zadar. The lid shows a reclining St Simeon.
