Trg Pet Bunara | Zadar, Croatia |  Built in 1574 on the site of a former moat, this square takes its name from the five wells that supplied Zadar with water until 1838. Set into the neighbouring bastion is Queen Jelena Madijevka Park, a lovely little garden with shady paths, a cafe and views from the ramparts.
