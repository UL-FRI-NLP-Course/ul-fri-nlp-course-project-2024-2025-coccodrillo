Krupa Waterfalls | Bosnia & Hercegovina, Europe |  Secluded in the Vrbas River valley, between Banja Luka and Jajce, these exceedingly pretty cascades are rendered even more photogenic by a set of log-built mill huts with their own millraces. A path follows the stream up through mossy woodland beyond the mills. The waterfalls are a short stroll from a car park lined with cafes, 700m off the main M16 road.
