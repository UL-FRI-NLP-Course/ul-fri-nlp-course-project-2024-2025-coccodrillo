Pliva Lakes | Bosnia & Hercegovina, Europe |  These two idyllic lakes, west of Jajce, reflect the surrounding wooded mountains in their clear waters, and are popular for boating and simply strolling or cycling around. Between them lie the Mlinčići, a cute collection of 20 tiny wooden watermills. At the bottom of the lower, smaller lake, boardwalks cross a pretty set of rivulets spilling into a dam basin, which is a popular swimming spot.
