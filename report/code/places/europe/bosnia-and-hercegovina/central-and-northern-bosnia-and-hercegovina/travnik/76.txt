Old Town Fortress | Bosnia & Hercegovina, Europe |  Travnik's 15th-century fortress surveys the city from a shoulder of hillside above Plava Voda. The stone walls gleam so brightly in the sunshine that they appear to have been scrubbed. The restored multisided keep houses a modest museum of local history and folk costumes.
