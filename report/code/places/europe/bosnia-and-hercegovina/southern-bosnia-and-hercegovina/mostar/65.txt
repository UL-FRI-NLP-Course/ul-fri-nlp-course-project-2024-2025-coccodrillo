MuM | Mostar, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Strong on poetry, far less so on content, the slightly baffling 2014 annex of the Museum of Hercegovina has a dozen showcases on ethnographic lines and five silent big-screen movies highlighting Hercegovina's scenic and cultural highlights. These are complemented by an audioguide that offers a mix of explanations, myths and flowery inspirational eulogies.
