Art Gallery of BiH | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Behind a sturdy Austro-Hungarian facade this small but inspired three-level gallery hosts a changing series of exhibitions. The top floor has a semi-permanent theme covering the 'intimacies of space', providing an opportunity to show off some of the collection's fine canvasses of interiors and still lifes, mostly mid-20th century.
