Musički Paviljon | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Forming the centrepiece to a pretty park just across the river from the old town, this distinctive former bandstand was originally built in 1913, though what you see today is a 2004 reconstruction. Today it's a cafe, although sitting at one of the outside tables is generally more pleasant than drinking inside, as the glassed-in interior can get smoky.
