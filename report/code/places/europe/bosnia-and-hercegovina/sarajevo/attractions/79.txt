Ashkenazi Synagogue | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  This 1902 neo-Moorish building is both a community centre and the main place of worship for Sarajevo's much-diminished Jewish community. Don't be put off by the utilitarian entrance; head upstairs to the beautifully painted main hall. The lavish geometric frescoes on the ceiling resemble a Turkish carpet.
