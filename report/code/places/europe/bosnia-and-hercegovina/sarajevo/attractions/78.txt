Vrelo Bosne | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Ever popular with local families, this extensive park is home to a patchwork of lush mini-islands at the cliffed mouth of the Bosna River. The classic way to get there is to stroll or take a horse-drawn carriage ride (20KM) for 3km along elegantly tree-lined Velika Aleja, starting near Ilid≈æa's Hotel Aleja.
