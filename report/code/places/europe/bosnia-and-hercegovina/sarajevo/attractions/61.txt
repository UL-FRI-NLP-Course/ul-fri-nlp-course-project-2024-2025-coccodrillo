Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Bosnia's second Ottoman governor, Gazi Husrev-beg, funded a series of splendid 16th-century buildings, of which this 1531 mosque, with its 45m minaret, is the greatest. The domed interior is beautifully proportioned and even if you can't look inside, it's worth walking through the courtyard with its lovely fountain, chestnut trees and the turbe (tomb) of its founder.
