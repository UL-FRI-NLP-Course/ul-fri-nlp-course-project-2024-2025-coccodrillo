Ars Aevi | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Many of the works in this thought-provoking contemporary art gallery were collected as donations for Bosnia during the 1990s conflict. The collection includes works by the likes of Anish Kapoor, Nan Goldin and Marina AbramoviÄ‡; a rotating selection of them is displayed in a factory-esque interior of metal ducts and polished chipboard within the lumpy Skenderija Centar.
