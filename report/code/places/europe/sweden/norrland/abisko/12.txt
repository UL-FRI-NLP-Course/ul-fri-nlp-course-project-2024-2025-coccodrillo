Aurora Sky Station | Abisko, Sweden |  Across the highway from the STF Turiststation, a chairlift takes you up Mt Nuolja (1164m), where you can enjoy epic views from the deck of the Panorama Café. In summer this is a prime spot from which to see the midnight sun – the lift is open 10pm to 1am three days per week in June & July. In winter, come to view the northern lights.
