Riddarhuset | Gamla Stan, Stockholm |  The House of Nobility once hosted some of the most influential and powerful people in Sweden's history. Built in the 17th century, this magnificent and lavish building was strategically placed between the Royal Palace and governmental institutions on the island of Riddarholm. Often overlooked by visitors moving between the two islands, it's now a heraldic shrine to the age of the once mighty Swedish nobility.
