Sergels Torg | Stockholm, Sweden |  Stockholm's living room, this circular square (which was undergoing major repairs on our last visit, but was still accessible to foot traffic) is a little on the grungy side, and you'll want to keep close tabs on your wallet, but it's a key transit hub as well as a great place to catch the pulse of the city. Something's always going on here, be it an impromptu classical music performance or a hundreds-strong political demonstration.
