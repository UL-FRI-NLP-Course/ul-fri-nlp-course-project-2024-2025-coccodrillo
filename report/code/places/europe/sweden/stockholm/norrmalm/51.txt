Kulturhuset | Stockholm, Sweden |  This architecturally divisive building, opened in 1974, is an arts hub, with a couple of galleries and workshops, a cinema, three restaurants, and libraries containing international periodicals, newspapers, books and an unusually good selection of graphic novels in many languages. It's home to Stadsteatern (the City Theatre), with performances in various-sized venues (mostly in Swedish). Stockholm's main visitor centre is also here, on the lower level.
