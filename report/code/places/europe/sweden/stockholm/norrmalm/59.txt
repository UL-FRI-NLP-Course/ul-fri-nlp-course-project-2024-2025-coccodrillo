Nationalmuseum | Stockholm, Sweden |  Sweden’s largest art museum is home to the nation’s collection of painting, sculpture, drawings, decorative arts and graphics from the Middle Ages to the present.
At the time of research it was undergoing a major renovation to expand public spaces, and add climate control and natural light, with the works due to be completed in early 2018. Highlights from the collection are temporarily on display at Stadsteatern inside Kulturhuset.
