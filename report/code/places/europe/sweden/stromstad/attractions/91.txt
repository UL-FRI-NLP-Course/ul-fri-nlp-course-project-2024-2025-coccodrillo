Stone-Ship Settings | Bohuslän, Sweden |  One of Sweden’s largest, most magnificent stone-ship settings (an oval of stones, shaped like a boat) lies 6km northeast of Strömstad. There are 49 stones in total, with the stem and stern stones reaching over 3m in height; the site has been dated to AD 400 to 600. Across the road is a huge site containing approximately 40 Iron Age graves. The tourist office can help with transport. Alternatively, there’s a gorgeous walking path from the north of town.
