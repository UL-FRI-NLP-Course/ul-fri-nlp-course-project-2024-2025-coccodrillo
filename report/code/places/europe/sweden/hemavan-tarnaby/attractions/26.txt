Atoklimpen | Lappland, Sweden |  Atoklimpen (1006m), a monolithic, bare mountain 35km west of TÃ¤rnaby, has been regarded as holy by the Sami for centuries. Evidence of sacrificial sites and encampments with hearths is scattered across the area, and dates back to the 15th century; a 3km trail leads up to the top.
Near the car park (off Rd 1116) is a peat hut and a small cottage, built by a Sami couple in the early 1920s, a time when the government forbade the Sami to build permanent structures; the ensuing debate over the cottage helped to change the law in 1928.
