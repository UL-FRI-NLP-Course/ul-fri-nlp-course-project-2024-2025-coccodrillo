Town Gate Tower | Slovakia, Europe |  Views are sublime from this octagonal tower, part of a 15th-century fortification. An inconspicuous glass elevator carries you most of the way, then there are some stairs to navigate to reach an open-air deck with a 360-degree view of the old town. It's a marvellous photo-op looking onto the castle, as well as the synagogue and old town â€“ go in the late afternoon, when coppery light enhances the view.
