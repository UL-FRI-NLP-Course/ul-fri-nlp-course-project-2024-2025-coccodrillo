Lower Gate Underground Museum | Košice, Slovakia |  The underground remains of medieval Košice – lower gate, defence chambers, fortifications and waterways dating from the 13th to 15th centuries – were only uncovered during construction work in 1996. Get lost in the maze-like passages of the archaeological excavations at the south end of the square, which include the oldest walls in town.
