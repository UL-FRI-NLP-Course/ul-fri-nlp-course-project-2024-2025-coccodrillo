Cathedral of St Elizabeth | Ko코ice, Slovakia |  This 14th-century cathedral dominates Ko코ice's main square, its gables bristling above tall, stained-glass windows while colourful roof tiles evoke a resplendent scaled dragon. One of Europe's easternmost Gothic cathedrals, 60m-long St Elizabeth is the largest in the country. Ascend 160 stone steps up the narrow stairwell of 59.7m-tall Sigisimund Tower to peep out across the city.
Below the church, a crypt contains the tomb of Duke Ferenc R치k칩czi, who was exiled to Turkey after the failed 18th-century Hungarian revolt against Austria.In summer, guided tours illuminate the history behind various features of the church, as well as entering the oft-closed St Michael's Chapel outside.
