East Slovak Museum | Košice, Slovakia |  Choose your own adventure at this sizeable regional museum with two distinct galleries. 'Centuries in Art’ offers richer cultural insights, with 16th-century woodcarvings, silversmithery and Gothic art, along with lavish parlour furniture from the 18th century onwards. Better for kids is the ‘Carpathian Nature’ exhibition, with antler-lined hallways, dinosaur figurines and enjoyably retro presentations on space exploration.
