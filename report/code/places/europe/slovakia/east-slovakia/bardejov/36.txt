Icon Exposition | Eastern Slovakia, Slovakia |  Slovakia’s largest collection of icons can be found just off the southern end of Bardejov’s main square. The religious artwork in this well-presented grouping, a branch of the Šariš Museum, is spread across two floors, and ranges from elaborate wooden sculptures to icons painted simply on canvas (a common practice among poorer communities). A soaring choral soundtrack piped through the museum heightens the celestial atmosphere.
The highlight is a broad, blue iconostasis from 1766, with numerous apostolic portraits and Biblical scenes.Photography inside the gallery costs an extra €2.
