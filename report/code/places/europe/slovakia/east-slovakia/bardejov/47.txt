Old Synagogue | Eastern Slovakia, Slovakia |  The centrepiece of an ambitious project to restore and preserve structures relating to Bardejov's Jewish history is this synagogue, part of a compound of 19th-century buildings. Enquire at the tourist information centre to see inside, and for tours of Bardejov's Jewish heritage buildings.
In the 1920s, Jews formed more than one-third of the town's population. Almost the entire community of 3000 Jews was transported to concentration camps during WWII and few survived.
