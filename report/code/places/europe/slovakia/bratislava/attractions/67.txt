Museum of Jewish Culture | Bratislava, Slovakia |  This enriching museum unveils the stories of Bratislava's once-thriving Jewish community through photographs and objects from daily life, with a focus on the impressive Jewish architecture lost both during and after WWII.
It's poignant to see oil paintings of death marches, created by Jewish survivors of the war, and timelines of the community's destruction by the Nazis.
