Blue Church | Bratislava, Slovakia |  Dedicated to St Elisabeth of Hungary in 1913, the early-20th-century 'Blue Church' is a vision in sapphire and powder-blue. From its undulating arches and ceramic roof tiles to the tip of its clock tower (36.8m), it's a marvel of art nouveau design.
During the limited opening hours, you can step inside to see the baby-blue pews and gold decoration.
