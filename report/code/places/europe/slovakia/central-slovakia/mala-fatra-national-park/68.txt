Juraj Jánošík Statue | Slovakia, Europe |  The cyborg-like statue of Juraj Jánošík, Slovakia's Robin Hood, gazes across the town of Terchová from a hill, looking as though he's stepped out of a poster for Fritz Lang's Metropolis. A path climbs up to the 7.5m iron statue from Vrátňanská cesta. A few walking trails extend from the statue into surrounding meadows.
There's a car park near Hotel Gold.
