Peter’s Market | Latvia, Europe |  Vendors have touted their wares here since the mid-17th century. The market expanded in 1910, when an art nouveau–style pavilion was constructed adjacent to the square. Today you’ll find stalls inside and out at this bustling complex, selling everything from second-hand clothes and beautiful handicrafts to fresh, locally grown produce and baked goods.
