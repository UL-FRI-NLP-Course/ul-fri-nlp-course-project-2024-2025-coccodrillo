Seaside Park | Latvia, Europe |  Ancient trees, manicured flower beds, water features, elegant walkways and cycling trails make this 3km-long park the very definition of an urban oasis. To the east are the once-elegant 19th-century wooden holiday homes, to the west are the shimmering sands of the beach. Festivals large and small are held here all summer long.
