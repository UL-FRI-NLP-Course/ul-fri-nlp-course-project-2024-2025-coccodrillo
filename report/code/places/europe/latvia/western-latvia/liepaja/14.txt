St Nicholas Maritime Cathedral | Latvia, Europe |  The stunning cathedral, with its bulbous cupolas, shines like a precious stone through the grey concrete of the decrepit Soviet apartment blocks that surround it on all sides. Built in 1901 in the Russian revival style, the cathedral was restored in the 1990s. Proper attire is required (no shorts etc).
