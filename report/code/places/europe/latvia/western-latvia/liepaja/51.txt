Liepāja Under Occupation Museum | Latvia, Europe |  Traces the bloody history of the Soviet and Nazi occupations in Latvia, with an emphasis on Liepāja. Captions are in Latvian, but no words are needed to explain the powerful images of the 1939–40 deportations to Siberia (an estimated 2000 people from Liepāja were deported), the genocide committed against Latvian Jews (over 5000 massacred in and around the city) and the 1991 fight for independence.
