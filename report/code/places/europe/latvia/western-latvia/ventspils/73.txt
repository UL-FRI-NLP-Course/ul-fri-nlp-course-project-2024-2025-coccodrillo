Livonian Order Castle | Latvia, Europe |  This blocky building doesn't look obviously castle-like from the outside, but the 13th-century interior is home to an entertaining interactive local history and art museum. During Soviet rule the castle was used as a prison, and an exhibit in the stables recounts its horrors.
