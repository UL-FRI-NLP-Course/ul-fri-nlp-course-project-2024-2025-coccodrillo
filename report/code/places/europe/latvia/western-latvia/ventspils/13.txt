Ventspils Beach | Latvia, Europe |  For Ventspils, the wide stretch of dazzling white sand south of the Venta River is its main treasure. During the warmer months, beach bums of every ilk – from nudists to kiteboarders – line the pristine Blue Flag sands to absorb the sun’s rays. It's backed by a belt of dunes and a lush manicured park.
