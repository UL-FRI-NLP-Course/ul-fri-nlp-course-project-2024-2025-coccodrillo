Seaside Open-Air Museum | Latvia, Europe |  For centuries, life in Kurzeme revolved around seafaring and fishing. Occupying vast parkland territory, this museum features a collection of fishing crafts, anchors and traditional log houses, brought from nearby coastal villages. A bonus attraction is a narrow-gauge railway, which recreates a line built by the occupying Germans in 1916. The route runs for over 2km through the city's parks.
