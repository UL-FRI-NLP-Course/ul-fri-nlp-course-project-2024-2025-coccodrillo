Apriki Lutheran Basilica | Latvia, Europe |  The stolid church in this tiny village predates its first recorded mention in 1640. The interior is a stunner, itâ€™s a perfectly proportioned flamboyant fantasy in blue, gold and white. Note the second-floor pews so the barons would not have to associate with the peasants.
