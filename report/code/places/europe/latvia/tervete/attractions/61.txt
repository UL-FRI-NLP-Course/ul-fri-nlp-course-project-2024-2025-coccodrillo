Tērvete Nature Park | Southern Latvia, Latvia |  Tērvete Nature Park protects three ancient mounds, including the impressive Tērvete Castle Mound, which was abandoned by the Semigallians after several battles with the Livonian Order. But its main pull is the Fairy Tale Forest, populated by whimsical wood-carved figures that almost come alive in the dark shade of ancient fir trees.
