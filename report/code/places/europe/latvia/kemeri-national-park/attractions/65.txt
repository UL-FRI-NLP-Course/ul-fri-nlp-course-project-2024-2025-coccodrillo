Hotel Ķemeri | Latvia, Europe |  You can't miss the Hotel Ķemeri. Known as the ‘White Ship’, it was built during Latvia’s brief period of independence in the 1930s, and has one of the most impressive facades outside Rīga. At the moment, only the sparkling white exterior can be appreciated, while plans for a full renovation drag on.
