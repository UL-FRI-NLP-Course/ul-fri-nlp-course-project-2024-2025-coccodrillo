Veczemju klintis | Latvia, Europe |  Veczemju klintis, halfway between Saulkrasti and SalacgrÄ«va, is a dramatic spot for a picnic and a walk. The jagged cliffs have a deep reddish hue and are the highlight of this 14km stretch of protected coast known as the Vidzeme Rocky Seashore. Rippled sands undulate between tiny capes and caverns. Look for a tiny, dirt road just south of the point where the A1 runs right along the water, then head south along the bluffs for 4km.
