North Vidzeme Biosphere Reserve | Latvia, Europe |  A pristine, 4500-sq-km domain that is roughly 6% of Latvia’s total land share and inscribed in Unesco’s ‘Man and the Biosphere’ program. The vast reserve is best uncovered on a canoeing or cycling adventure. Each year in autumn, visitors can fish from a small bridge for lampreys. The bridge is washed away during the spring thaw and rebuilt each summer.
