Bread Museum | Latvia, Europe |  Learn about the history and traditions surrounding traditional Latgalian dark rye bread, a local staple, and try your hand at milling grain and baking. Little English is spoken, so call ahead to arrange a complimentary translator. Even if you donâ€™t have time for the one-hour presentation, be sure to buy a fresher-than-fresh loaf of gorgeous bread still warm from the large oven. Peek through the window into the kitchen to watch the bakers hard at work.
