St John's Church | Latvia, Europe |  Switch on your imagination in this 13th-century church where armour-clad Livonian knights prayed and buried their dead in what was then a lonely island of Christianity surrounded by the lands of pagans. Currently under restoration, it's the home of the town's Lutheran community and the church contains tombs of the order's grand masters and top bishops.
