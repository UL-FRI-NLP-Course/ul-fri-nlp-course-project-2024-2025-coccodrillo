Rīga Brethren Cemetery | Rīga, Latvia |  The Brothers' Cemetery features a monument by Kārlis Zāle (the designer of the Freedom Monument) dedicated to the Latvian soldiers who died during WWI and the battles for independence between 1915 and 1920. It's a vast, mournful spot that, when combined with the larger parks area around it, makes for a thoughtful stroll on an autumn day. Tram 11 stops nearby.
