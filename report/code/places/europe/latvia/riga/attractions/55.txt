Latvian Ethnographic Open-Air Museum | Rīga, Latvia |  If you don’t have time to visit the Latvian countryside, a stop at this open-air museum is a must. Sitting along the shores of Lake Jugla just northeast of the city limits, this stretch of forest contains more than 100 wooden buildings (churches, windmills, farmhouses etc) from each of Latvia’s four cultural regions. Take bus 1 to the ‘Brīvdabas muzejs’ stop.
