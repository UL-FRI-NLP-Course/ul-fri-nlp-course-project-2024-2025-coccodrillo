Krāslava Castle | Latvia, Europe |  Occupying a key vantage point, Krāslava's 'castle' is really a modest manor house. Its historic interior is closed to visitors, but the floral-scented grounds are pretty and good for strolling. Part of the complex, the small History and Art Museum has displays outside showing pictures of local life since the 1850s. A nearby tourist information office (www.visitkraslava.com) sells local crafts.
