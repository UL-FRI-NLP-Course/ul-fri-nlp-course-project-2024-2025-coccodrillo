Duch vum Séi | Luxembourg, Europe |  A former cloth factory in operation until 1975 is now a museum whose displays include an impressive collection of old textile looms. Some still produce items such as hats, scarves, rugs, pillowcases and hot-water bottle covers, which are sold in the museum shop. It's 600m southwest of the village.
Also here is the visitor centre of the Parc Naturel de la Haute Sûre nature park.
