Beaufort Castles | Luxembourg, Europe |  Beaufort's two castles sit across a wooded valley on the town's western edge. Built from sandstone on the site of a Roman camp, the five-storey medieval castle expanded from 11th-century origins but never recovered from WWII bombing during the Battle of the Ardennes. You're free to explore its many levels. In the 17th century, a Renaissance-style castle was constructed alongside it â€“ compulsory guided tours last 50 minutes. Admission to either castle includes a tasting of locally made Cassero fruit liqueur.
