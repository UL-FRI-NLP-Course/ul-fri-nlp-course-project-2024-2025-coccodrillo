Grand-Rue | Luxembourg, Europe |  Grand-Rue’s most attractive section is around Place Victor Abens, where the town hall straddles a small spring. The Église des Trinitaires church was built in 1248 and reconstructed after a fire in 1498; behind it the pretty cloister that was once the heart of the monastery remains.
Both the stairway between Grand-Rue 58/60 (opposite the church) and the alley Montée du Beffroi (just west of Musée de la Ville de Vianden) take you towards an isolated 1603 belfry on a ridge outcrop. It’s closed to visitors, but there are beautiful views over the town and river.
