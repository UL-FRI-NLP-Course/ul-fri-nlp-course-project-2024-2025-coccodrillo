Musée d’Histoire de la Ville de Vianden | Luxembourg, Europe |  Vianden's local history museum is formed from two houses knocked together. One maintains its full 19th-century decor; the other partly retains equipment from its 1950s incarnation as a bakery. Upstairs, historical and cultural exhibits are brought to life by human cut-out mannequins and push-button music. It's all in German, but a well-presented English-language accompanying text is available on request at the ticket desk.
