DÃ«nzelt | Luxembourg, Europe |  The most distinctive building on Echternach's delightful town square is this stone-fronted former law court. Its origins date back to the 14th century, though the arcade, statues and corner turrets that give it its current neo-Gothic appearance date from an 1895 rebuild. The interior is closed to the public.
