Musée de la Banque | Luxembourg City, Luxembourg |  Where better than the financial hub of Luxembourg to spend an hour browsing through a bank museum? It's housed in the dramatic, century-old, castle-style headquarters of the Banque et Caisse d'Épargne de l'État, and traces over 150 years of tradition and innovation in banking, from piggy banks to ATMs and bank robbers.
