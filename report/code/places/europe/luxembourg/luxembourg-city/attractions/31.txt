Cath√©drale Notre-Dame | Luxembourg City, Luxembourg |  Built between 1613 and 1621, and enlarged between 1935 and 1938, Luxembourg's cathedral is most memorable for its distinctively elongated black spires, ornately carved Renaissance portal inside the main doorway, and 19th- and 20th-century stained glass. Interior highlights include a tiny but highly revered Madonna-and-child idol above the altar and the graves of the royal family in the crypt.
