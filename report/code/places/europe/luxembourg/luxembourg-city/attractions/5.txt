Chemin de la Corniche | Luxembourg City, Luxembourg |  Hailed as 'Europe's most beautiful balcony', this pedestrian promenade winds along the course of the 17th-century city ramparts with views across the river canyon towards the hefty fortifications of the Wenzelsmauer (Wenceslas Wall). The rampart-top walk continues along Blvd Victor Thorn to the Dr√§i Tier (Triple Gate) tower, stretching 600m in total.
