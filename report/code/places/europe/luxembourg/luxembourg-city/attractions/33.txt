Am Tunnel | Luxembourg City, Luxembourg |  Deep beneath the Spuerkeess bank is a permanent exhibition on photographer Edward Steichen, who put together Clervaux’ Unesco-listed Family of Man photographic exhibition. Access is via the separate building Bâtiment Rousegaertchen and a tunnel carved 350m through the Bourbon plateau. The tunnel walls display rotating photography exhibits.
