Musée du Cacao et du Chocolat | Brussels, Belgium |  Exhibits at Brussels’ museum of cocoa and chocolate give you a quick rundown of chocolate’s history in Europe, along with chocolate’s anti-aging and antidepressant properties. A couple of small treats along the way include a tasting at the praline-making demonstration. Better yet are the museum’s occasional one-hour praline-making courses – call for details.
