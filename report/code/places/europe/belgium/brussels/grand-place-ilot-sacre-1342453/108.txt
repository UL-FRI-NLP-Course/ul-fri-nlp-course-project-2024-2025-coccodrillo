Église Ste-Catherine | Brussels, Belgium |  Église Ste-Catherine must be one of the only religious buildings that positively encourages folks to urinate on its walls (there’s a ‘pissoir’ on its northwestern flank). Inside is a black statue of the Virgin and Child that Protestants once hurled into the Senne (1744); the statue was found ‘miraculously’ floating on a chunk of turf.
