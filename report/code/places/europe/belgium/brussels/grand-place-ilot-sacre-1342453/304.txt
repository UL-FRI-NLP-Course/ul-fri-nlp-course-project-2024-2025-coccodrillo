Musée de la Brasserie | Brussels, Belgium |  Brussels’ brewery museum is authentic in the sense that it occupies the basement of the brewers’ guildhall and has some 18th-century brewing equipment. But visitors are often disappointed because it's small and no actual brewing takes place (though you do get a beer at the end). To see a real brewery in action, head to the Musée Bruxellois de la Gueuze at the Cantillon Brewery.
