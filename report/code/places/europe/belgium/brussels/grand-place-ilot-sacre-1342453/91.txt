Broussaille | Brussels, Belgium |  Painted in 1991 by Frank PÃ©, Broussaille was the city's first giant mural and depicts a young couple arm in arm. This strip is located in Brussels' gay-nightlife hub and originally it was difficult to tell whether the couple was a man and a woman or two men. Gay establishments used the mural to promote the quarter until 1999, when it was repainted and the black-haired figure was given a more feminine hairstyle, earrings and (slightly) bigger breasts.
Creeping homophobia or honest mistake? Nobody knows.
