Maison Cauchie | Brussels, Belgium |  Built in 1905, this stunning house was the home of architect and painter Paul Cauchie (1875â€“1952), and its sgraffito facade, adorned with graceful female figures, is one of the most beautiful in Brussels. It looks like a Klimt painting transformed into architecture. A petition saved the house from demolition in 1971, and since 1975 it has been a protected monument. If you can't time a visit to meet the limited opening hours, the facade alone definitely warrants a visit.
