Wiels | Brussels, Belgium |  It’s well off the usual tourist track, but this converted brewery building located toward Bruxelles-Midi houses the capital’s center for contemporary art exhibitions. In the downstairs café, the old tiled walls and vast copper vats have been retained, and there's also a bookshop.
