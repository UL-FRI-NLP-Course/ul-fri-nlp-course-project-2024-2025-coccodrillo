Africa Museum | Brussels, Belgium |  Due to reopen in late 2018 after five years of restoration, the revived Africa Museum looks set to be a big draw, and a world away from its earlier dusty colonial incarnation. The exhibits are predominantly from former Belgian colony the Congo, and include some beautiful musical instruments, masquerade masks and artfully carved pot lids. Resident artists and a digital project give the space a contemporary focus.
