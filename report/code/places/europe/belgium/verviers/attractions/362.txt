Place du March√© | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Vervier's most attractive square is dominated by a stately town hall, with cobbled Mont du Moulin descending photogenically past ivy-draped and half-timbered buildings to the north. A road sign points incongruously to Bradford (775km) and other traditional textile towns.
Markets are held here on Saturday mornings.
