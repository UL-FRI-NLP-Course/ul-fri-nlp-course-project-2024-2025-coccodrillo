Limbourg | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Well worth the 1km detour if you're driving between Eupen and Verviers (turn south at Dolhain), Limbourg is one of Belgium's most delightful historic villages.
It is raised on a promontory with a long, roughly cobbled central square lined by picturesque houses including a superb old-world brasserie-cafe facing the former town hall, which now hosts an art gallery featuring a model of medieval Limbourg as it looked when it was a fully fortified citadel.
