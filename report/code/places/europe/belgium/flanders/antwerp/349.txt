St-Pauluskerk | Antwerp, Belgium |  Strangely easy to miss despite its towering bulk, this church was consecrated in 1571 as part of a Dominican monastery, and thoroughly rebuilt after a 1679 fire. It has retained elements of its resplendent baroque interior despite a further series of catastrophes, most notably a 1968 inferno after which restoration took more than 20 years.
