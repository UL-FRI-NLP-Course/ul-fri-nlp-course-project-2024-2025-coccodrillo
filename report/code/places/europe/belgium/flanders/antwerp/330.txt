’t Bootje | Antwerp, Belgium |  Part of a 1901 town house called De Vijf Continenten (The Five Continents), ’t Bootje has a fabulous wrought-iron lamp but is named for its little ship-shaped balcony.
This repeats a motif from the grand if more classically styled 1897 school building across the street. It's a private residence that's not open to the public. One of the flats is used as the Chilean consulate.
