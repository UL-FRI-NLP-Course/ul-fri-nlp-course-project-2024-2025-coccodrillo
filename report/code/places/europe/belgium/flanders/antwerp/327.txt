Help U Zelve | Antwerp, Belgium |  Help U Zelve has arguably the city's most beautiful and harmonious art nouveau facade. Built in 1901 by architects Van Asperen and Van Averbeke as the Socialist Party headquarters, it features mosaics of rural workers (who also just happen to be naked) along with organic, swirling wrought-ironwork.
It's now used as a Rudolph Steiner school and is not generally open to the public.
