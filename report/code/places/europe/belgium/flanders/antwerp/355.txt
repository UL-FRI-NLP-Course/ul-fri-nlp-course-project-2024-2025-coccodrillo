De Twaalf Duivelkens | Antwerp, Belgium |  The architectural delight of the Zurenborg suburb goes well beyond art nouveau, as you'll see at this humorous 1900 chalet-style house designed by Jules Hofman.
Its defining feature is an upper balcony held up by a row of 12 semi-comic devils whose demeanour suggests suffering based on toiletry needs rather than hellfire.
