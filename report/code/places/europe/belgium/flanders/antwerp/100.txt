Het Steen | Antwerp, Belgium |  On a riverside knoll, Het Steen is a dinky but photogenic castle dating from 1200 and occupying the site of Antwerp’s original Gallo-Roman settlement. While still visible, the site is fenced off until restoration is completed (estimated to be 2020).
Outside is a humorous statue of Lange Wapper, a tall folkloric ‘peeping Tom’ figure showing off his codpiece to two diminutive onlookers.
