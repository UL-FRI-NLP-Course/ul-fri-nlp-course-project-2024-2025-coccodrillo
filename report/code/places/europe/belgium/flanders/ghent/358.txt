Graslei | Ghent, Belgium |  Ships have been docking on either side of the River Leie since the 11th century. The area on the east bank is known as Graslei; Korenlei is on the west. There are always people here milling about, wining, dining, or sitting on the stepped riverbank admiring the stunning architecture.
