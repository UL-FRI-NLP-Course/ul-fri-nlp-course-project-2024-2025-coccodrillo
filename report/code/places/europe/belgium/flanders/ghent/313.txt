MIAT | Ghent, Belgium |  In a five-floor 19th-century mill-factory building, this thought-provoking museum celebrates Ghentâ€™s history of textile production and examines the social effects of 250 years of industrialisation. An extensive collection of heavy mechanical weaving equipment comes deafeningly alive on Tuesday or Thursday mornings around 10am; earplugs are provided. There are great city skyline views from the top floor.
