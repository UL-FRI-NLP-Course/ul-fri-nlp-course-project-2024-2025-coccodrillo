De Wereld van Kina: de Tuin | Ghent, Belgium |  This 7700-sq-metre garden and hot-garden with more than 1500 plants (plus live bird spiders) has a broader age appeal than its sister museum, the House. It's somewhere the kids can come to learn and have fun, while their custodians can relax a little and enjoy the natural beauty of the plants and garden. The admission fee grants entry to both complexes.
