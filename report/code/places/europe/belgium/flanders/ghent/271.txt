Design Museum | Ghent, Belgium |  A vast toilet-roll sculpture humorously marks the back side of this museum, which has a collection specialising in furnishings including baroque, art nouveau, '70s psychedelic and '90s furniture-as-art styles. Itâ€™s hosted in an architecturally eclectic building that catapults you from the 18th century into the 21st, then drags you back again.
There is no elevator in the building; numerous stairways mean restricted access for those with disabilities or mobility issues.
