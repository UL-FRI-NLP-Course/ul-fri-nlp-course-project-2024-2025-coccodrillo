Museum Dr Guislain | Ghent, Belgium |  Hidden away in an 1857 neo-Gothic psychiatric hospital, this enthralling mental-health museum takes visitors on a trilingual, multicultural journey through the history of psychiatry, from gruesome Neolithic trepanning to contemporary brain scans via cage beds, straightjackets, shackles and phrenology. Dr D’Arsonval’s extraordinary 1909 radiographic apparatus looks like a Dr Frankenstein creation.
