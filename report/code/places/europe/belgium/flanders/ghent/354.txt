Korenmarkt | Ghent, Belgium |  Ghent's best-loved waterfront square, the 'Wheat Market' is where you'll find some of the city's best architecture, including the former post office (now shops and the 1898 The Post boutique hotel) and the imposing Sint-Niklaaskerk, a Tournai bluestone church started in 1200.
