St-Maarten en St-Niklasskerk | Ypres, Belgium |  Directly behind the Lakenhalle, this vast church was a cathedral until 1797 and was almost totally destroyed in WWI. Reconstruction has beautifully restored its soaring Gothic interior; it's hard to believe that the church was built in the 20th century.
