Merghelynck Museum | Ypres, Belgium |  Unrelated to WWI, this museum faithfully reproduces a French manor house dating from 1774 and is filled with period antiques and artworks. The catch: it's only open to the public when (irregular) guided tours are being held: contact the tourist office to book a private tour or to find out if one is scheduled that you can join.
