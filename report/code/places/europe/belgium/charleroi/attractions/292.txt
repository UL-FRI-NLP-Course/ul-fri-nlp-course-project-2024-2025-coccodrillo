Tour Bleue | Wallonia, Belgium |  Rising some 75m above the city centre, the aptly named 'Blue Tower' is Charleroi's most eye-catching new building. Designed by celebrated French architect Jean Nouvel, the tapering blue-brick landmark houses the city's police headquarters. The adjoining buildings – redesigned by the same firm – house dance studios and artist residences for Charleroi/Danses, a rather surprising pas de deux between law enforcement and the performing arts.
