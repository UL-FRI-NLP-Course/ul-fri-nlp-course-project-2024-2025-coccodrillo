Bastogne Barracks | The Ardennes, Belgium |  These active barracks were once the HQ of General McAuliffe's 101st Airborne Division. Excellent, enthusiastic two-hour guided visits peruse the reconstruction centre for WWII vehicles and the 'Nuts' room where mannequins of that wartime Christmas dinner add to fascinating explanations of key parts of the Battle of the Bulge.
The barracks entrance is 500m north of Place St-Pi√®rre.
