Maison des Géants | Wallonia, Belgium |  If you miss the giants' festival, you can learn more at the Maison des Géants, in a grand old mansion opposite the castle-style tower of Église St-Julien. The museum shows how the giants are created and gives a taste of the revelry through video presentations. Giants from other festivals around the world are also on display.
