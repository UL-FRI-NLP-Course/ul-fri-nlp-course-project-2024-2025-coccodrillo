Kapel van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw van Oudenberg | Northwest Belgium, Belgium |  It's believed there has been a place of worship at this site atop the Muur since 1294, although this quaint, domed-roof neo-baroque chapel was constructed as late as 1906. The inside is aglow with scores of candles lit by pilgrims.It's a lovely spot to take a quiet moment of contemplation and to enjoy beautiful views over the bucolic fields below.
