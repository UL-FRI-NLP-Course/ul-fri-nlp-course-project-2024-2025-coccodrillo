Ch√¢teau de Durbuy | The Ardennes, Belgium |  At the heart of Durbuy is this fairly modest riverside castle that dates from 1756, the medieval original having been destroyed by the ravages of Louis XIV's French forces. Its spired turrets give a certain flair to the townscape but the property is private and you can't go inside.
