Musée Archéologique | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Mementoes of Arlon’s Roman and Merovingian history are displayed in the rich, but rather static, Musée Archéologique.
With a combination ticket (€6) you can also visit the attractively furnished Maison Gaspar across the road, with sculptures, photos and the notable Retable de Fisenne, a splendid 16th-century altarpiece.
