Tombeau du GÃ©ant Viewpoint | The Ardennes, Belgium |  The Ardennes' most celebrated panoramic viewpoint overlooks a perfect hoop of river valley creating a forested peninsula. The viewpoint is on a dead-end road around 10km from Bouillon, reached by a circuitous route.
If you wanted to reach the peninsula itself, however, you'd need to walk along the south bank of the Semois from Bouillon. An interesting round-trip hike is possible.
