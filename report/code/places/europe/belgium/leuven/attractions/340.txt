Sint-Antoniuskapel | Leuven, Belgium |  Though originally built before 1329, this chapel is now an archetypal work of 1960s church design, made memorable as the last resting place of Father Damian, Belgium's missionary 'saint'.
His black-slab grave still attracts pilgrims and boards in the church illustrate Damien's work with Hawaiian lepers, which was the basis of the Hollywood movie Molokai.
