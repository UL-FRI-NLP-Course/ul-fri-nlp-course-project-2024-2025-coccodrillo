Artoth√®que | Wallonia, Belgium |  Ever thought it was a pity that all those items sat in museum storerooms, never seeing the light of day? Well, this innovative space in a former convent chapel lets you examine a wide range of objects from various museum basements, with interactive screens (in French, but staff can arrange translation) allowing you to locate them and inform yourself about them. Items range from soldiers' wartime rations and ceramics to clothing and fine art. Original and entertaining.
