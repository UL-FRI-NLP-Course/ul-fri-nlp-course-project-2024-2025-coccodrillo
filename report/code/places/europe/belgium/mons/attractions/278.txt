Beffroi | Wallonia, Belgium |  The 87m-tall Unesco-listed baroque belfry is a 17th-century marvel topped by black-and-gold mini-domes. The lift takes you up to only 36m, though the panoramic views are still impressive (you can climb a further two flights of stairs for a look at the clock mechanism and bells). The surrounding garden (admission free) occupies the hilltop site of what was originally Monsâ€™ fortress.
Note that the entrance is up the steep ramp leading up from Rue des Clercs.
