Cimeti√®re Militaire de Saint-Symphorien | Wallonia, Belgium |  Just 5.5km east of Mons, this small cemetery is one of the most peaceful and thought-provoking in Belgium. The resting place of roughly equal numbers of German and British soldiers from WWI, it includes the tombs of the first and last Commonwealth soldiers to die in the conflict.
