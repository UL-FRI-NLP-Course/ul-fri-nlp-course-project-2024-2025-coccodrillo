Trésor de Sainte Waudru | Wallonia, Belgium |  The small church treasury displays Ste-Waudru’s shrouds and, in a reliquary, a sword-slashed skull – supposedly of sainted Merovingian king Dagobert II. Some conspiracy theorists consider that Dagobert’s murder in 675 was an attempt to put an end to the ‘Jesus bloodline’.
