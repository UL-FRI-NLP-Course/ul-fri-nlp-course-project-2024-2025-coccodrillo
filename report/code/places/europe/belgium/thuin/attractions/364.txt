Beffroi de Thuin | Wallonia, Belgium |  Looming high above the village is Thuin's 1639 stone bell tower topped with five slate spires and numerous gilded baubles. Apart from the (loud!) bells and old/new clock mechanisms, the tower is empty, and one climbs up metal steps and steep ladders for the fine regional views. Enter via the adjacent tourist office.
