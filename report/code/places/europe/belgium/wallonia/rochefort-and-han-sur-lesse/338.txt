Malagne | Wallonia, Belgium |  On the third Sunday of July, this Gallo-Roman archaeological site comes to life with a whole series of period demonstrations. At other times, the attractive rural ruins are less dynamic, and you'll probably value the free audioguide to make sense of the excavations, reconstructed mill, experimental archaeological projects and Roman vegetable gardens. It's 2km east of Rochefort.
