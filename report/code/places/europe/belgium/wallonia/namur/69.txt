Église St-Loup | Namur, Belgium |  Baudelaire reputedly described this remarkable baroque church as a ‘sinister and gallant marvel’. With purple marble columns, black stone arches, elaborately carved confessionals and complex ceiling tracery sculptured in white tufa, it's a curious and imposing sight.
