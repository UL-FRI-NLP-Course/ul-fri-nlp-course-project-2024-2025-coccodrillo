Musée de Groesbeeck-de-Croix | Namur, Belgium |  In a very fine 1753 former abbot’s house are displays of decorative arts in 23 beautifully furnished rooms around a formal courtyard garden. Don’t miss the 18th-century kitchen. At the time of research it was closed for long-term renovations, but is scheduled to reopen by mid-2019.
