Musée des Arts Anciens du Namurois | Namur, Belgium |  In an 18th-century mansion, this interesting museum displays old artworks from the local region, paintings by 16th-century artist Henri Blès and many religious pieces, including a hoard of priceless Mosan chalices, crosses and reliquaries with a very colourful history. Entry fees rise during temporary exhibitions. Enter opposite the tall, red baroque frontage of the 1655 Église St-Joseph.
