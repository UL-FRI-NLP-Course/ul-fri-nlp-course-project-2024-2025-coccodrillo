Église St-Quentin | Wallonia, Belgium |  Église St-Quentin is a hefty Romanesque church with a 12th-century nave, posterior Gothic features and a striking red-tiled roof. When viewed from near here, the cathedral's classic cluster of five grey-stone towers seems to float ethereally above the Grand Place, especially at sunset or at night. Restored after heavy WWII damage, the interior is handsome in light-grey stone but lacks a bit of atmosphere.
