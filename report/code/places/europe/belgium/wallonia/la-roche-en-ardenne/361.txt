Grès de la Roche | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Learn about La Roche’s two main cottage industries in an imaginative hour-long audio-guided tour. Press-and-sniff buttons add some fun as you're introduced to kiln-firing and ham-smoking methods. Pottery workshops for children are available in summer.
The museum is 500m from Pl du Bronze following the river east.
