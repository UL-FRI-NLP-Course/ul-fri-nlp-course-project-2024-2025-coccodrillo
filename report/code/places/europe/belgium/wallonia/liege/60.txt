Liège-Guillemins Train Station | Liège, Belgium |  Liège's main train station, around 2km south of the centre, is an incredible 2009 icon designed by Santiago Calatrava. Great for semi-abstract landscape photography, its bold white sweeping curves create the impression of a vast glass-and-concrete manta ray.
From platform 1 there's a nicely framed view of the Tour Paradis, a 118m-tall sail-shaped glass skyscraper for accountant-bureaucrats.
