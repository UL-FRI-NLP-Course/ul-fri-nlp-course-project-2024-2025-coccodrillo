Église Collégiale St-Barthélemy | Liège, Belgium |  This large Rhenish-style church has twin Saxon-style towers and a cream-and-cerise exterior. It houses a famous 1118 baptismal font that’s one of the world’s most celebrated pieces of Mosan art.
The font is a great brass bowl that was rescued from a sub-chapel of St-Lambert’s Cathedral when the complex was demolished in 1793. It rests on oxen figures and is adorned with five baptismal scenes, elaborately described in a video screened nearby. To glimpse the font for free, peer through the long, narrow slit window in the church’s western end.
