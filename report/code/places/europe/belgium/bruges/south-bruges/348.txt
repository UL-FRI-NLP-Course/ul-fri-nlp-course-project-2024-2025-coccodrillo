Arentshuis | Bruges, Belgium |  This stately 18th-century patrician house displays the powerful paintings and dark-hued etchings of Frank Brangwyn (1867–1956), a Bruges-born artist of Welsh parentage. His images of WWI – he was an official war artist – are particularly powerful. Admission is free with your Groeningemuseum ticket.
