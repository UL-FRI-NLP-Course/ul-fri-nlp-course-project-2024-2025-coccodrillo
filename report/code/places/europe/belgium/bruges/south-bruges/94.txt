Hof Arents | Bruges, Belgium |  Behind the Arentshuis, Hof Arents is a charming little park with a hump-backed pedestrian bridge, St-Bonifaciusbrug, that crosses the canal, offering idyllic views. Nicknamed Lovers’ Bridge, it’s where many a Bruges citizen steals their first kiss. Privileged guests staying at the Guesthouse Nuit Blanche get the romantic moonlit scene all to themselves once the park has closed.
