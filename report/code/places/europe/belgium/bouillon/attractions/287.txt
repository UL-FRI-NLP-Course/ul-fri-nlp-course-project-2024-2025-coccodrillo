Musée Ducal | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Between the town and Château de Bouillon's car park, this museum spreads over two historic houses and includes a small antique smithy (free access). Museum displays highlight Bouillon's history from the First Crusade through the local metallurgy industry, but also has works by celebrated local artist Albert Raty (1889–1970). The folklore section only opens in July and August.
In winter the museum is closed except during school holidays.
