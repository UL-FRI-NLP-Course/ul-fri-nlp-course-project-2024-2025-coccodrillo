Statue of Marvin Gaye | Ostend, Belgium |  Soul superstar Marvin Gaye wrote his last hit, 'Sexual Healing', in 1981 while living in Ostend. His residency is marked by a wildly tacky statue of the singer playing a golden piano. To see it, peep inside the convention centre of Ostendâ€™s bold 1950s landmark, the Kursaal, now home to Ostend's popular casino.
