Fort Napoleon | Ostend, Belgium |  The impenetrable, pentagon-shaped Fort Napoleon is an unusually intact fortress dating from 1812, though there’s comparatively little to see inside. The audioguide covers many of the same topics you’ll have heard at the Atlantikwall. Drinking at the fortress café gets you decent glimpses without paying the entrance fee.
