Fourneau St-Michel | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Some 10km north of St-Hubert towards attractive Nassogne village, Fourneau St-Michel is a superb open-air museum featuring around 50 historic buildings salvaged from villages around Wallonia and authentically rebuilt in a rural setting of woodland and pasture. Many are furnished and they're arranged geographically into 'hamlets' linked by a 3km walking trail.
Even if you don't have time to see the whole place, it's still worth having a drink or snack in the wonderful L'Auberge du Pr√©vost, occupying one of the complex's finest half-timbered farmhouses (no ticket needed).Visit on 21 July to see the place come to life with volunteers dressed in traditional costumes. Without your own wheels getting here is awkward.
