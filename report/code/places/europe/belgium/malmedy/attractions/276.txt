Cathédrale Saints Pierre, Paul et Quirin | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Fronted by stubby twin towers, Malmédy's massive 1784 cathedral provides a dominating if slightly dour centrepiece to the town.
Founded as the church of a 10th-century abbey, the original was burnt down during French attacks in 1689 and the current structure had only recently been re-erected when the monasteries were swept away in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Afterwards it was used as a tannery workshop for a while before being reconsecrated in 1818.
