Malmundarium | The Ardennes, Belgium |  In the covered former abbey cloisters beside Malmédy's cathedral, this cultural centre/museum hosts temporary exhibitions to pad out a city-history display, carnival room and a quietly moving, interactive examination of the former local tanning and paper-making industries.
Though it had been 'state of the art', the last tannery (and Malmédy's main employer) went bankrupt in 1994.
