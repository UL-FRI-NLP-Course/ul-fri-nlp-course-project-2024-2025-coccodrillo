Hougoumont | Wallonia, Belgium |  This classic fortified farm is around 20 minutesâ€™ walk southwest of the Butte du Lion. Had Napoleon broken through here early in the battle, everything might have turned out very differently. Recently restored to its original appearance, this a peaceful rural spot: it's hard to imagine the desperate struggle of 1815, but a modern exhibition and impressive audiovisual display do their best to evoke it. Entry is included with Memorial 1815, from where free blue shuttle buses run to the farm.
A cottage in the complex houses a cosy apartment decorated in period style, which sleeps four and can be booked for stays of three days or more. Prices drop substantially in low season.
