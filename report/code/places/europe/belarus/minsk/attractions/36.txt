Church of St Aleksandr Nevsky | Minsk, Belarus |  This red-brick church was built in 1898, closed by the Bolsheviks, reopened by the Nazis, closed again by the Soviets and now it's open once more. It's said that during WWII, a bomb crashed through the roof and landed plum in front of the altar, but failed to detonate.
It's on the grounds of a cemetery. Enter on vul Kazlova.
