Lyaskavichy Nature Museum | Belarus, Europe |  Pripyatsky National Park's nature museum is a real find in out-of-the-way Lyaskavichi. Fully air-conditioned and modernized, it has beautiful exhibits and dioramas dedicated to the park's indigenous flora and fauna and to the folk traditions of the region. The exuberant Russian-speaking staff will gleefully guide you through it all whether you understand them or not.
