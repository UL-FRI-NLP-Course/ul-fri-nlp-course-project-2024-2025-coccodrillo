Military Glory Museum | Belarus, Europe |  This polished museum is dedicated to the many wars that took place in Homel from the 14th to the 20th century. The heaviest coverage is reserved for WWII, sprinkled with the usual tinge of Soviet propaganda. The displays on Nazi atrocities are particularly poignant, and there is a huge collection of tanks, anti-aircraft guns, helicopters and other war machinery in the backyard.
