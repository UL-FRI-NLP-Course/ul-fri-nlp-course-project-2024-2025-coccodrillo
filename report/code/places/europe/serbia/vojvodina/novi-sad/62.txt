Church of the Name of Mary | Novi Sad, Serbia |  Called simply ‘the Cathedral’ by the locals, the 1895 Church of the Name of Mary on Trg Slobode is the largest Roman Catholic church in Novi Sad. Built in neo-Gothic style, it boasts stained-glass windows and a 72m-high tower which unmistakably points your way around the city centre.
