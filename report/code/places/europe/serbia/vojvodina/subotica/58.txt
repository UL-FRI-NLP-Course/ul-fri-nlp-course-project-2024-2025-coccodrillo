City Hall | Subotica, Serbia |  Built in 1910 and designed by Marcell Komor and Deszö Jakab, this behemoth is a curious mix of art nouveau and something Gaudí may have had a playful dab at. The council chambers – with exquisite stained-glass windows, Zsolnay ceramics and elaborate decor – are not to be missed. A guided tour of the building takes place at noon; you can also opt to climb its soaring, 76m-high tower for fantastic views.
