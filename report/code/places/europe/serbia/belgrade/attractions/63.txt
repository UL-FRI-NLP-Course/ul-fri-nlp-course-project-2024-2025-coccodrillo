Clock Tower | Belgrade, Serbia |  Climb the 18th-century, 27.5m-tall towerâ€™s narrow stairs to check out the inner workings of this landmark clock and snap some panoramic shots of Kalemegdan Park and Belgrade Fortress, though in recent years it's often closed due to to being run by unreliable volunteers.
Tickets must be purchased in advance from the souvenir shop within the Inner Stambol Gate.
