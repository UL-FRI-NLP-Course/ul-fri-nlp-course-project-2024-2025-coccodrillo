Orthodox Cathedral | Belgrade, Serbia |  Dedicated to Archangel Michael, this cathedral was constructed between 1837 and 1841 on the site of an earlier 18th-century church; it’s opposite the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Built mainly in classicist style, it has a baroque tower and an impressive Romanticist iconostasis. Inside the crypt are the tombs of Prince Miloš and his son Prince Mihailo, while great 19th-century Serbian scholars Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and Dositej Obradović are buried in the church’s graveyard.
