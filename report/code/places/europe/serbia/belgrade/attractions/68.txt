Nikolajevska Church | Belgrade, Serbia |  Goggle at the astounding baroque iconostasis at this church in the Zemun neighbourhood, believed to be the oldest in Belgrade. It's thought to have been built in 1570, but its current facade dates to the 1750s. Its ruined interior, full of faded paintings and murals, is one of the spookiest you'll see.
