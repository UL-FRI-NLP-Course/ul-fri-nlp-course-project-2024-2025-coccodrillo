Museum of Contemporary Art | Belgrade, Serbia |  One of Belgrade's top cultural sights, this recently renovated museum is a treasure trove of 20th-century art from the ex-Yugoslav cultural space. The 1960s concrete-and-glass modernist building, surrounded by a sculpture park, has great views towards the Belgrade Fortress across the Sava River.Conceptual art features prominently, including a 1970s video called Freeing the Memory from the region's most famous artist (and Belgrade native), Marina AbramoviÄ‡. One section is dedicated to the 1920s Yugoslav avant-garde magazine Zenit and the Zenitism art movement associated with it.
