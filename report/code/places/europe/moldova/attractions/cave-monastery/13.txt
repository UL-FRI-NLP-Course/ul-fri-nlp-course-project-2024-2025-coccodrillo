Cave Monastery | Moldova, Europe |  The most impressive sight at Orheiul Vechi is the Cave Monastery, built inside a cliff high above the gently meandering RÄƒut river. It is marked by a small bell tower and a cross standing on the rocks. It was dug by Orthodox monks in the 13th century and remained inhabited until the 18th century. In 1996 a handful of monks returned to this secluded place of worship and restored it to its current state.
