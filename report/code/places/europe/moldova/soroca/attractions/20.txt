Candle of Gratitude | Moldova, Europe |  You can get fantastic views of the Dniestr and the perfectly partitioned fields of Ukraine beyond from this curious obelisk, which was erected in 2004 to honour the 'anonymous heroes' responsible for preserving Moldova's culture over the years. It's accessible by a 660-step (not an exact count) stairway on the town's southern outskirts.
