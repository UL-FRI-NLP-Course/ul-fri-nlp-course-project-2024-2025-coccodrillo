Łowicz Cathedral | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  Originally Gothic, this vast 15th-century church underwent several renovations and is now a melange of styles, including Renaissance, baroque and rococo. Twelve archbishops of Gniezno and primates of Poland are buried in the church. The interior – when you find it open – glitters from all the elaborate gold embellishments.
