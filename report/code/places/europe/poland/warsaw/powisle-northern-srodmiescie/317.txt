Elektronia Powi≈õle | Warsaw, Poland |  Keep your eyes peeled for new openings, including a boutique hotel, bars, cafes, restaurants and shops in the early-20th-century power plant that has been decommissioned since 2001 and is being transformed into luxury apartments and a contemporary hub. As the project progresses, pop-up shops and markets happen here.
The hulking red-brick complex saw much action during the last stages of the Warsaw Rising when it was a redoubt for insurgents.
