Czapski Palace | Warsaw, Poland |  Today housing the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts, Czapski Palace, completed in 1705, is regarded as one of the best examples of rococo architecture in the city. Chopin lived in an annex of the palace from 1827 to 1830, when he left Warsaw for the final time.
Damaged during WWII, the palace was rebuilt between 1948 and 1959.
