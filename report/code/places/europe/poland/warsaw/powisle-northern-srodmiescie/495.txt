Ethnographic Museum | Warsaw, Poland |  Although it's a little complicated to navigate and could do with a bit more in the way of English signage, this museum has a fine assembly of Polish folk art and crafts, as well as fascinating temporary exhibitions. Ask at reception for directions to the traditional costumes gallery, which is a museum highlight.
