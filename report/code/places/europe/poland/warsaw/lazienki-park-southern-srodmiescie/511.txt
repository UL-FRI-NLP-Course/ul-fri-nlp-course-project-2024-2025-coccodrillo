White Pavilion | Warsaw, Poland |  No relation to its Washington namesake, this pavilion was erected in 1774 as a temporary residence until ≈Åazienki Park's palace was finished. It was closed for renovations at the time of research, but when it reopens you will be able to see exhibitions of pieces from the Royal Collection of Prints.
