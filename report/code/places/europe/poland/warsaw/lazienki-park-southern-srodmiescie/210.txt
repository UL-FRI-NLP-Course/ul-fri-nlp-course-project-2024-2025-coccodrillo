Museum of Hunting & Horsemanship | Warsaw, Poland |  The museum's collection is split across two park buildings dating from the 1820s. The Cantonists' Barracks features natural-history-style displays of stuffed forest animals, birds and trophy heads, alongside the antique weapons used to kill them – either fascinating or horrific depending on your views about hunting. In the Kubicki Stables are a dozen historical horse-drawn vehicles, including carriages and a sleigh, as well as horse equipment used on aristocratic estates.
The museum is within Łazienki Park.
