Mausoleum of Struggle & Martyrdom | Warsaw, Poland |  Once used by the Gestapo for interrogation, torture and murder, this building now stands as a memorial to the thousands of Poles who passed through its doors. With its depressing basement holding cells and an interrogation room (complete with original bullwhips, coshes, knuckledusters etc), itâ€™s a grim slice of Warsaw history.
