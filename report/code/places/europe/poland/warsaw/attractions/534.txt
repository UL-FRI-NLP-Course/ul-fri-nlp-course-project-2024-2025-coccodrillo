Villa Przybytkowskich | Warsaw, Poland |  This wooden home seems like it has been parachuted into the city from the countryside. It was originally built in the 1880s and sits at an odd angle to the road as it was here well before Saska KÄ™pa was fully incorporated into the city and divided into residential plots.
