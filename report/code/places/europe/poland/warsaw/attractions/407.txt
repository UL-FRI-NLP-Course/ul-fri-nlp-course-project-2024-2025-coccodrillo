Lachert Villa | Warsaw, Poland |  Bohdan Lachert and Józef Szanajca designed this 1928 modernist villa to incorporate Le Corbusier’s five points of modern architecture: the free design of the facade, the free design of the ground plan, roof gardens, horizontal ribbon windows, and pilotis (columns that supported the ground floor).
There are several other modernist design buildings along ul Katowicka.
