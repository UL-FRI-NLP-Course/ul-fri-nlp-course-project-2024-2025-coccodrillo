St Andrew the Apostle Church | Warsaw, Poland |  This neo-Renaissance Catholic church, modelled on the Roman basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, was completed in 1849 and is a survivor of WWII. The exterior is punctuated with niches containing statues of saints.
The church stands on an attractive trapizoid-shaped square named after Jerzy Popie≈Çuszko, a priest associated with solidarity who was murdered by communist authorities in 1984.
