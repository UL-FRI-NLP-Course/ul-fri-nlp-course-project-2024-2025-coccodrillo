Willy Brandt Monument | Warsaw, Poland |  On 7 December 1970 German chancellor Willy Brandt famously fell to his knees in front of the Ghetto Heroes Monument in a gesture of contrition for Germanyâ€™s crimes against Polish Jews. This red-brick clad memorial, featuring a brass relief designed by Wiktoria Czechowska Antoniewska, commemorates that event in a corner of the park that is now named after Brandt.
