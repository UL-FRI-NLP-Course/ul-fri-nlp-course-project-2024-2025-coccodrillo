Anielewicz’s Bunker | Warsaw, Poland |  Also known as Miła 18, the memorial mound and obelisk mark what was once a hidden shelter during the time of the Warsaw Ghetto, used by ŻOB, a Jewish resistance group. The Germans discovered it in 1943; Mordechaj Anielewicz, the leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and several others chose to commit suicide here rather than surrender.
