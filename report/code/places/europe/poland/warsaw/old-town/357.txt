Museum of Pharmacy | Warsaw, Poland |  Officially named after the Master of Pharmacy and women's rights campaigner Antonina Leśniewska (1866–1937), this charming little museum is devoted to the history of traditional pharmacies. The walnut wooden shop fixtures in the first exhibition hall are exquisite and display medicines bottles in all shapes and colours.
A small exhibition here also covers kampo – Japanese traditional medicines.
