St Kazimierz Church | Warsaw, Poland |  Attached to a monastery of Benedictine nuns, this interesting 17th-century church is the work of prominent architect Tylman van Gameren. It has a fine baroque exterior and a clean white interior. Used as a hospital for insurgents during WWII, and thus targeted for bombing by the Germans, the church was rebuilt in the 1950s.
