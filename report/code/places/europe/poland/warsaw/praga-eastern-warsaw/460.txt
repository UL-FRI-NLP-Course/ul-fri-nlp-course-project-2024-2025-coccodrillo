St Michael & St Florian Cathedral | Warsaw, Poland |  Completed in 1904 to the design of Józef Dziekoński, this neo-Gothic-style cathedral has twin 75m spires that were deliberately built taller than the cupolas of the nearby Orthodox church – a defiant snub to the Russian authorities at the time. It was destroyed in 1944 by the Germans, and rebuilt after the war to reopen in 1972.
