Jedwabne Pogrom Monument | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  On July 10, 1941, over 300 local Jews were rounded up and marched into a barn near the Rynek. The doors were locked and the barn was set on fire, incinerating the people inside. In the years since, a small memorial was built on the spot. It includes charred wood from the barn and is 650m from the Rynek.
