History Museum | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Housed in an Empire-style merchant’s house called the Braunschweig Palace, the sister institution to the Polish Arms Museum has a neatly presented collection, with an emphasis on weights and scales (metrology). Head downstairs for an interesting audiovisual presentation (in English on request) about the city’s history, using images of old postcards from Kolberg (the town's old German name).
