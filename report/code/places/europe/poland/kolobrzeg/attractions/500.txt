Amber Museum | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Kołobrzeg's Amber Museum displays several kilos of prehistoric tree sap in a gleaming white, 21st-century space. It's not a patch on the Malbork or Gdańsk amber museums, but an interesting indoor distraction if the Baltic weather gods decide to spoil your beach day. There's also a small shop and workshop.
