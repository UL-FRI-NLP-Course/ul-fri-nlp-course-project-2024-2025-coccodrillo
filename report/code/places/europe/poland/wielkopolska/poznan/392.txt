Museum of the Wielkopolska Uprising 1918–1919 | Poznań, Poland |  In the old guardhouse on the western side of the buildings in the centre of the Rynek, this museum details the battles waged by Polish fighters seeking independence from Germany after the end of WWI. It’s an interesting if compact museum with displays of military uniforms, weaponry, photographs, and documents created for the newborn Polish state that the Uprising hoped to help create.
