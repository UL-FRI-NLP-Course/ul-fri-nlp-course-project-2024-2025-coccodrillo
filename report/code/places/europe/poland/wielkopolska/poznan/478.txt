Museum of Armaments | Pozna≈Ñ, Poland |  Unmistakable because of a collection of fighter jets and tanks outside, this museum is dedicated to weaponry and is located within the picturesque Citadel Park, itself once a massive Prussian fortress. Buses 176 and 603 are useful for reaching the park as they run the length of Garbary.
