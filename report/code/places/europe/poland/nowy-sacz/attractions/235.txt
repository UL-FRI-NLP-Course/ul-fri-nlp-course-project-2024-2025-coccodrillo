Gothic House | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  Built for canons of the nearby Collegiate Church in 1448, this broad-beamed brick townhouse now contains a branch of Nowy Sącz's regional museum. Dedicated to the religious and folk traditions of Sądecczyzna (the land surrounding Nowy Sącz), its permanent exhibitions include naive religious paintings and folk-art woodcarvings collected from rural churches and roadside chapels throughout the region. The collection of 15th- to 19th-century Orthodox art, which includes a splendid iconostasis of the 17th century, is especially fine.
