Centre of Glass Heritage | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  Celebrating Krosno's five centuries as Poland's epicentre of glass production, this slick exhibition centre is the town's main attraction. The family-friendly museum, with three levels and English signage, tells the story of Krosno glassmaking, exhibits outstanding pieces in glass and allows visitors to work glass themselves. Sitting at the Rynek's northeastern corner, it extends underground, below the market square.
