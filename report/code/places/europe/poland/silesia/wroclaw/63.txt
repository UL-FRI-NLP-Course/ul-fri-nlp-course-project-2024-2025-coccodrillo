Cathedral of St Mary Magdalene | Wrocław, Poland |  One block east of the Rynek is this mighty Gothic red-brick cathedral, dating to the 14th century. Its showpiece is a Romanesque portal from around 1280 on the exterior south wall, which originally adorned the Benedictine Abbey in Ołbin, but was moved here in 1546 after the abbey was demolished. You can climb the 72m-high tower and cross the Bridge of Penitents.
