University of Wrocław | Wrocław, Poland |  Established by the Jesuits in the early 18th century, the University of Wrocław's main edifice was built between 1728 and 1742. While it's very much a functioning seat of scholarship, it is partly open to sightseers – enter through the grand blue-and-gold rococo gate at the western end to start exploring. The principal attraction is the baroque ceremonial hall known as the Aula Leopoldinum.
