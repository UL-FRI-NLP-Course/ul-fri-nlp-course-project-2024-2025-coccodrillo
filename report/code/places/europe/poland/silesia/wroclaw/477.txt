Church of St Giles | Wrocław, Poland |  In contrast to the enormous neighbouring Cathedral of St John the Baptist, the austere, brick-built Romanesque Church of St Giles seems barely a cupboard. But, built between 1218 and 1230, it is notable as the oldest surviving church in Wrocław, and sports an original Romanesque portal.
