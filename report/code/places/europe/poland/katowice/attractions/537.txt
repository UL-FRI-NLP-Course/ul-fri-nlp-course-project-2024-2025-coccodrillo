Garrison Church of St Casimir the Prince | Katowice, Poland |  A functionalist concrete-and-brick affair with lovely art deco interiors, it was built between 1930 and 1933 (the year before the skyscraper opposite, also a functionalist landmark, was completed). Outside masses, the church isn't always open without prior arrangement.
