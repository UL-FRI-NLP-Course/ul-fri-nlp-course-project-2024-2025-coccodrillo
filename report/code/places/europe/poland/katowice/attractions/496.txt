Spodek | Katowice, Poland |  Built of reinforced concrete between 1964 and 1971, Spodek – which means 'saucer' – really does look like a UFO has landed just north of central Katowice. Aside from being a venue for indoor sports such as basketball, handball and volleyball, it's played host to rock acts including Deep Purple and Pearl Jam.
