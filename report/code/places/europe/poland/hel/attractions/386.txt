Fokarium | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Just off the beach in the centre of town is the Fokarium, where Baltic grey seals can be seen in captivity. The three large pools are home to half a dozen of the creatures, and feeding takes place at 11am and 2pm when keepers put these incredibly obedient animals through their paces for fishy rewards. You’ll need a 5zł piece to unlock the main turnstile – the small museum inside is free.
