Caponier 8813 | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  This scary-looking cement bunker was built by the USSR in 1939 as part of the Molotov Line, along its then-border with Nazi Germany. It saw intense fighting in 1941, after the Germans attacked their former allies and later overran Przemy≈õl (and much of Eastern Europe). Currently its interior isn't accessible.
