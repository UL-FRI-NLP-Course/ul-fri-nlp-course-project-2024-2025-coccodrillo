Town Hall | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  Rzesz√≥w's pretty town hall is the natural focus of attention in the Rynek, dominating its southwest corner. It dates from the 16th century but was wholly remodelled in the 19th century in the then-current neo-Gothic style. As a working administrative building, it's closed to the public.
