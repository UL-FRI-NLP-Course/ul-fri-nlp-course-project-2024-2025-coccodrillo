New Town Synagogue | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  Also called the 'big' synagogue, since it's much larger than the Old Town Synagogue next door, this house of worship dates to the early 18th century and was built in a fusion of Renaissance and baroque styles. It was used by the Germans as a warehouse during WWII, and after the war fell into ruin. It was given over to an artists' collective and these days houses a gallery of contemporary art.
