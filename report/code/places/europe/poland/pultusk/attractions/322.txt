Collegiate Church | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  At the northern end of the market square is this church, erected in the 1440s. It underwent the usual architectural makeover every few centuries, and contains a dozen ornate baroque altars, Renaissance stucco decoration on the nave's vault, and aisles with original Gothic features. Note the 16th-century wall paintings in the chapel at the head of the right-hand aisle. Although often locked, you can usually peer in through a gate in the entry.
