Museum of Sea Fishery | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  If you’re keen on stuffed sea life, you’ll be delighted by the static displays of albatrosses, sharks and seals, along with fishing paraphernalia, model boats, amber and a few fish in tanks. On the top floor you'll discover an interesting exhibition on the history of Świnoujście using old postcards from Swinemünde, some hefty 18th-century Pomeranian trunks and souvenirs of yesteryear. On the ground floor is a separate section (different ticket needed) that features a coral-reef aquarium.
