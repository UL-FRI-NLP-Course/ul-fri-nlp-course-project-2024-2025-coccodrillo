Regional Museum | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  Augustów's regional museum is housed in two locations. The most interesting collection is dedicated to the history of the Augustów Canal and is housed in a quaint, 19th-century wooden cabin a short walk from the pleasure boat wharf. The other section, several blocks from the Rynek, features a small ethnographic exhibition. You'll find it on the upper floor of the public library.
