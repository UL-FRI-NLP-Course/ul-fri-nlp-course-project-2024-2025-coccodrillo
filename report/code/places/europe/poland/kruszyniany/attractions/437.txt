Mizar | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  The Muslim cemetery is located in a patch of thick woodland 100m east of the mosque. The recent gravestones are Christian in style, showing the extent of cultural assimilation that has taken place. Go deeper into the wood, where you'll find old tombstones hidden in the undergrowth. Some of them are inscribed in Russian, a legacy of tsarist times.
