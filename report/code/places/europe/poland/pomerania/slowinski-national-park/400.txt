Kluki Skansen | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Set on the southwestern shore of Lake Łebsko, the tiny isolated hamlet of Kluki was the last holdout of Slovincian culture, now showcased in the centrally located skansen, an open-air museum of traditional architecture. It’s modest but authentic, comprising original in-situ buildings. The long, two-family, whitewashed houses are fitted with traditional furniture and decorations.
