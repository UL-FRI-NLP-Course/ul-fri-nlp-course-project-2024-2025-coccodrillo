Pier | Sopot, Poland |  At the end of Monte Cassino, beyond Plac Zdrojowy, is the famous Molo, Europe’s longest wooden pier, built in 1928 and jutting 515m out into the Bay of Gdańsk. Various attractions along its length come and go with the seasons. The cheeky summer admission charge puts few off.
