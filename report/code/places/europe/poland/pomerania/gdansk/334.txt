Green Gate | Gdańsk, Poland |  Długi Targ is flanked from the east by the Green Gate, marking the end of the Royal Way. It was built in the 1560s on the site of a medieval defensive gate and was supposed to be the residence of the kings. But they never stayed in what turned out to be a cold and uncomfortable lodge, preferring the houses nearby, particularly those opposite Artus Court.
