Royal Way | Gdańsk, Poland |  Lined by the city’s grandest facades, the Royal Way was the route along which the Polish kings traditionally paraded during their periodic visits. Of the three Royal Ways in Poland (Warsaw, Kraków and Gdańsk), Gdańsk's is the shortest – it's only 500m long, but architecturally it is perhaps the most refined.
