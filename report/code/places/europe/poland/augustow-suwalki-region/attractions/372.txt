Church of St Mary | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  The proud two-towered silhouette of this church dominates the town from its northern end. It dates from the 1610s, but the facade was thoroughly remodelled 150 years later in the so-called Vilnius baroque style. Its pastel interior has harmonious rococo decoration. Although there's a parking lot attendant who will ask for money, the church is often locked. Weekday masses are held in the morning and evening.
