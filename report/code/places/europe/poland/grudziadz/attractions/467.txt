Church of St Francis Xavier | Gda≈Ñsk & Pomerania, Poland |  A few buildings in the centre retain their historical significance, the most impressive of which is this early-18th-century church. Most of the narrow interior is taken up by a beautiful baroque high altar, and the surrounding ornamentation includes some unusual chinoiserie created by a local Jesuit monk in the late 17th century.
