Castle Hill | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Grudziądz once had a 13th-century castle that stood sentinel high above the Vistula. The remains of this, essentially the 30m Klimek Tower and the results of an archaeological dig, have become the town's latest attraction following extensive renovation work. Climb to the top of the tower for stupendous views of the river, the town and Poland's longest concrete bridge below.
