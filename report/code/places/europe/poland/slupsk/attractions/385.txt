Mill | Gda≈Ñsk & Pomerania, Poland |  The building opposite the castle gate is the 14th-century mill, an annex to the museum. Its three floors focus on the folk customs of Pomerania with colourful costumes and chunky kitchenware galore. There's also an exhibition looking at the 1.7 million Poles who arrived in the area from the Polish-speaking territories of the east during the 20th century.
