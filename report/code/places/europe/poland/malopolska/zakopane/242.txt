Old Church & Cemetery | Zakopane, Poland |  This small wooden church and atmospheric cemetery date from the mid-19th century. The Old Church has charming carved wooden decorations and pews, the Stations of the Cross painted on glass on the windows and an unusual open-fronted confessional. The adjoining cemetery is one of the country's most beautiful, featuring amazing wood-carved headstones, some resembling giant chess pieces. The noted Polish painter and creator of the Zakopane Style, Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz, is buried here beneath a modest wooden grave marker.
