Museum of Zakopane Style | Zakopane, Poland |  Housed in the Willa Koliba, this was the first of several grand wooden villas designed by the noted Polish painter and architect Stanisław Witkiewicz in his ‘Zakopane Style’ (similar to the Arts and Crafts movement that swept the US and Britain at the turn of the 20th century). The museum is closed for renovation until 2020.
