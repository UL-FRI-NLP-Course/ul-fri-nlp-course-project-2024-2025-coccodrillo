Chapel on the Water | Małopolska, Poland |  Just near the Roztocze National Park Visitor Centre is this small chapel, St John of Nepomuk, the only significant structure remaining from the Zamoyski’s residential complex. The small, heavily restored baroque church sits on one of four tiny islets on the small lake of Staw Kościelny (Church Pond), which was allegedly dug by Turkish and Tatar prisoners in the 1740s.
