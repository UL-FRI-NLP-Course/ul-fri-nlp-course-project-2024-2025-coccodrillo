Main Synagogue | Małopolska, Poland |  Radom was a significant Jewish settlement, and the Jewish community here numbered around 30,000 just before WWII (about a quarter of the population). Unfortunately, few Jews survived the war and little of that heritage remains. Most Jews lived in the area around the (now dilapidated) Rynek. Near here, you’ll find a plaza with four red sandstone bases and a small memorial that mark where the main synagogue once stood.
