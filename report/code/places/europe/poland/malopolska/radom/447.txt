Jewish Cemetery | Małopolska, Poland |  About 4km east of the city centre is what remains of the former Jewish cemetery. The Germans destroyed the cemetery and used the grave markers as paving stones, but in the past decade some of the tombstones have been returned. The gate is usually locked and there’s not much to see, but the tourist office may be able to arrange a viewing.
