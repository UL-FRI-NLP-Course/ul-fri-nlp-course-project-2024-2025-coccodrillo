Stanisław Lem Science Garden | Kraków, Poland |  Science nerds will enjoy a day out at this interactive science park, about 4km east of the Old Town, dedicated to the memory of Polish science fiction writer Stanisław Lem. The outdoor exhibits explore some of the bizarre consequences of the laws of science, mechanics, optics and acoustics, and invite visitors to get involved, peering through prisms and striking gongs. Explanations are in both Polish and English.
