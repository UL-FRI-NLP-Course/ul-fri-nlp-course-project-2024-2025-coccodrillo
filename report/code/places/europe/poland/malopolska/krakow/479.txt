Arka Pana | Kraków, Poland |  The retro-modern Arka Pana was the first church in Nowa Huta, built from 1967 to 1977 after much controversy. Authorities had intended the workers' suburb to be a church-free zone, and it required protests and politicking by the local bishop (one Karol Wojtyła, who would later become Pope John Paul II) to get the job done.
