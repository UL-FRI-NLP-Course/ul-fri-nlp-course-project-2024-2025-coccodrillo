Bell Tower | Małopolska, Poland |  You can climb this free-standing bell tower by the cathedral, though the terrace is not high enough to offer a bird’s-eye view of the Old Town. The present tower was built between 1755 and 1775 after the original timber tower went up in flames. It contains three bells: Wawrzyniec (170kg), Tomasz (1200kg) and the largest, Jan (4300kg).
