Kielce Cathedral | Małopolska, Poland |  Kielce's cathedral looks nothing like the Romanesque church first erected here in 1171; it was rebuilt in the 17th century and dressed in baroque decorations. The cathedral's underground crypts are the final resting place for many bishops. It was given a massive overhaul in 2012 and has emerged gleaming. It overlooks Kraków Bishops' Palace.
