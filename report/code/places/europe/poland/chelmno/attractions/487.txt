Church of SS Peter & Paul | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Occupying the town’s northern corner, the impressive red-brick stepped gable of this 14th-century church fronts an interior containing doored rococo stalls, a huge baroque altar straddled by a star-studded globe and the tomb of the first bishop of Chełmno, Heidenreich. Sadly, it's not open to the public very often.
