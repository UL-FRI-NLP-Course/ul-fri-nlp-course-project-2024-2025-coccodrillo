Church of St Adalbert | Krak√≥w, Poland |  This small church on the southern corner of the Main Market Square is usually regarded as the city's oldest place of worship, with a history that stretches back some 1000 years. The church's 11th-century Romanesque roots are visible around the foundations, though the building was given a baroque dome in the 17th century. Classical music concerts are held here.
