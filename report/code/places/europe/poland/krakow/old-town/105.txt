Bunkier Sztuki | Kraków, Poland |  While Kraków's art scene focuses mostly on the 19th and 20th centuries or earlier, Bunkier Sztuki – literally 'art bunker' – houses three floors of contemporary works from young local Polish artists to international names. There's everything from photography to paintings, multimedia works and more here. Check the website for current exhibitions, which change every two to three months.
