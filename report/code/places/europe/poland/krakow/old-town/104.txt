Historical Museum of Kraków | Kraków, Poland |  At the northern corner of the square, the collection within the 17th-century Krzysztofory Palace is home to Cyberteka, an interactive exhibition which charts the city from its earliest days to WWI. The museum features a bit of everything related to the city’s past, including old clocks, armour, paintings, Kraków’s celebrated szopki (Nativity scenes), and the costume of the Lajkonik.
