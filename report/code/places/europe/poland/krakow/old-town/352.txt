MICET | Krak√≥w, Poland |  MICET is something a little different. Situated in the Stary Theatre, it's an interactive museum where visitors learn the traditional crafts associated with the theatre and then put their knowledge to use as they compose their own scenes, costumes and designs. It's kid-friendly and obviously best suited to visitors (of all ages) with an active interest in what happens backstage.
