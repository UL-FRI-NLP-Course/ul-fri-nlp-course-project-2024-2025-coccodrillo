Palace of Fine Arts | Kraków, Poland |  The centrepiece of the art nouveau Plac Szczepański is this elaborate edifice on its western side. An incredible frieze circles the building (product of Jacek Malczewski), while the busts on the facade honour Polish artists. The building is used for temporary art exhibits.
