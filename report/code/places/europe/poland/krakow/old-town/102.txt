Church of St Barbara | Kraków, Poland |  This sombre 14th-century church is located on the small, charming Plac Mariacki, which was a churchyard until the early 19th century. St Barbara’s was the cemetery chapel and served the Polish faithful during the Middle Ages. Note the skull and crossbones on the north exterior; just inside the entrance is an open chapel featuring stone sculptures of Christ and three of the Apostles, attributed to the Stoss school.
