Krakowski Park | Krak√≥w, Poland |  Renovated in spring 2018, this park is a lovely place to spend an hour with children, walking a dog or on your own. Added plants bring colour and attract bees to the area and you'll find ducks swimming in the central pond beneath a large overhanging willow tree. There's also a nook for borrowing and reading magazines and a fantastic play area for kids.
