St Florian’s Church | Kraków, Poland |  This 12th-century church’s location was chosen by the oxen that carried the remains of St Florian from Rome. When the beasts would go no further, it was interpreted as a sign of a holy site. In 1582, the church survived a fire that swept through the city; since then, St Florian has been a patron saint of Kraków and firefighters.
