Archdiocesan Museum | Kraków, Poland |  This collection of religious sculpture and paintings, dating from the 13th to 16th centuries, is located in a 14th-century townhouse. Also on display is the room where Karol Wojtyła (the late Pope John Paul II) lived from 1958 to 1967, complete with his furniture and belongings – including his skis. There’s a treasury of gifts he received here too.
