Museum of Municipal Engineering | Krak√≥w, Poland |  Trams and trucks fill the yard of this former tram depot, while inside there's a fun collection of cars and motorbikes. A room of hands-on magnetic and water experiments and some interactive science quizzes are sure to keep kids occupied, too. The museum is planning an extensive renovation, meaning that some rooms and exhibits may be closed on your visit. The museum is popular, especially on weekends, so book tickets in advance on the website.
