Rynek Kościuszki | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  Białystok's focal point, the much-rebuilt Rynek is an odd trapezoidal shape. Important buildings from the city's past have been reconstructed here, including the central town hall, home to the Podlasie Museum. On the west side of the building, note the plaque with the poignant 1930s photo of the vibrant and largely Jewish market that was once here. It and the people would be gone in a decade.
