Main Municipal Beach | Pafos, Cyprus |  In the centre of Kato Pafos, the main municipal beach is not your standard holiday-brochure-style sweep of sun-kissed sand: the beach area is paved and partly pedestrianised. Comprising a collection of wooden decks, rocks, sand and diving points, itâ€™s pleasant and the water is sparkling clean. Facilities include showers, toilets and a cafe-restaurant.
