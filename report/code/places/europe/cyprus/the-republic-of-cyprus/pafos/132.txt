Ethnographical Museum | Pafos, Cyprus |  Owned by the family of an eminent Pafos archaeologist, this museum houses a varied collection of coins, traditional costumes, kitchen utensils, Chalcolithic axe heads, amphorae and other assorted items. There’s more of the same in the garden, including a Hellenistic rock-cut tomb. The €5 guidebook available at the entrance helps you sort out the seemingly jumbled collection.
