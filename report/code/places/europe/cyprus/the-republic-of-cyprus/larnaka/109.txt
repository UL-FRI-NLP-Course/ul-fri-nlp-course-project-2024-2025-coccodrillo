Turkish Quarter | Larnaka, Cyprus |  Strolling the streets of the old Turkish neighbourhood of Skala is a glimpse into the Cyprus of old. This quaint district is a watercolour-worthy scene of squat cottages with peeling whitewash, coloured window shutters and flowerpot-studded doorways. Road signs here still carry their Turkish names, a reminder of Larnakaâ€™s mixed community before 1974. Today the quarter is being revived by a clutch of ceramic workshops that have made Skala their home, giving the area a distinct bohemian edge.
