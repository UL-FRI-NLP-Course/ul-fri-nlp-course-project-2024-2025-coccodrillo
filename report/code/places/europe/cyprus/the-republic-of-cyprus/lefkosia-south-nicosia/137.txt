Liberty Monument | Nicosia (Lefkosia), Cyprus |  This thought-provoking monument on the Podocataro Bastion represents Greek Cypriot liberation from British colonial powers. The figures of 14 Ethniki Organosi tou Kypriakou Agona (EOKA; National Organisation for the Cypriot Struggle) fighters being released from prison in 1959 alongside those of peasants and priests represent the various strata of Greek Cypriot society.
