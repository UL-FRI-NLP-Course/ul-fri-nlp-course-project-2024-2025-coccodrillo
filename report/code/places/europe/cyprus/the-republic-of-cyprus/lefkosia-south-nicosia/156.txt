Pancyprian Gymnasium | Nicosia (Lefkosia), Cyprus |  Cyprus' oldest still-operating school dates back to 1812. Lawrence Durrell, author of Bitter Lemons of Cyprus, taught English here for several years in the 1950s. The school is not open to the public but its museum collection, just to the north, is.
