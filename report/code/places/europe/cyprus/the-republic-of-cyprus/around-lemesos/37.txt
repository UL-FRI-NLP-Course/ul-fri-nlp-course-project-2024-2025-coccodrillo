Avdimou Beach | Cyprus, Europe |  This lovely stretch of beach is home to the sophisticated Zias Beach Club and the Kyrenia Beach Restaurant, which is superb for seafood. The views of the bay are stunning and the crystal-clear waters here are ideal for snorkelling. The restaurant rents out sunbeds and parasols (â‚¬4.50). Note that the scenic access road is rough in parts, but passable.
