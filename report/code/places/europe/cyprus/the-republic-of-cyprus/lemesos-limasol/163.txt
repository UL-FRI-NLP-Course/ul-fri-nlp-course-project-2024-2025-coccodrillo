Natural Sea Sponge Exhibition Centre | Lemesos (Limassol), Cyprus |  This exhibition goes through the process of sea-sponge harvesting, and how the living creatures become the soft things we use in our baths. The cartoon, duly dedicated to a talking sponge, will amuse younger kids. Naturally enough, you can purchase sponges here too.
