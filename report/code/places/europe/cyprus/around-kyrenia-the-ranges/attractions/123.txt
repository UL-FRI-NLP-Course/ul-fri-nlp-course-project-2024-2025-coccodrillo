Vrysi (Acapulco) Beach | Cyprus, Europe |  Now commonly called Acapulco Beach, thanks to the megaresort of Acapulco Holiday Village which manages it, Vrysi caters mainly to package tourists. Day visitors are welcome as well though and the (rather expensive) admission fee includes access to all the hotel facilities such as pools, changing rooms, sunloungers and umbrellas. The beach itself is lovely and clean, though it can get extremely crowded.
