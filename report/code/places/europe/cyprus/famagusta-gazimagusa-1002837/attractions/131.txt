Nestorian Church | Cyprus, Europe |  Built between 1360 and 1369 this Nestorian-order church has a sublimely well-preserved bell tower and squat golden-stoned facade.According to local tradition, if you take soil from the church grounds and place it in your enemy’s house, within one year they’ll either die or leave Cyprus (it’s probably best not to try out if this works on any enemies you have at home).
