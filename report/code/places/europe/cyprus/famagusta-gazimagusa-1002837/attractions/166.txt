Agios Ioannis Church | Cyprus, Europe |  This church sits 120m within the restricted zone of Varosia and although visits have been allowed in the past, presently it is unlikely you will be granted access. You need to approach from the main checkpoint â€“ don't be surprised if you are simply turned away.
