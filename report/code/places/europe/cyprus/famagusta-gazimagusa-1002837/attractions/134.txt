Namık Kemal Prison | Cyprus, Europe |  This former prison housed Turkish poet, playwright and dissident Namık Kemal (1840–88) for nearly four years after his writings offended the sultan. Inside there are only a couple of dusty exhibits and portraits, and one small room set up with a mannequin of the man himself, so unless you have a particular interest – and read Turkish – you can save the entrance fee.
