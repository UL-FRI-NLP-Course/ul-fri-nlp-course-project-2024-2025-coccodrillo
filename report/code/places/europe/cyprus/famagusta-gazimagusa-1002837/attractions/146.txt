Ravelin (Rivettina) Bastion | Cyprus, Europe |  Also known as the ‘Akkule’ or ‘white tower’. It was here that the Ottomans first breached Famagusta's walls, surrendered by the white-flag-waving Venetians. The bastion was undergoing restoration work when we were last in town but when it's finished you'll be able to enter the warren of rooms within.
