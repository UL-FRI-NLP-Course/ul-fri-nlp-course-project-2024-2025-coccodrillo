St Peter & St Paul Church | Cyprus, Europe |  Although not open to the public, the magnificent facade of this mammoth 14th-century church, which has survived intact, gives you a good impression of what Famagusta would have looked like before most of its churches and monuments were ruined.The churchâ€™s construction was funded by a local merchant, Simon Nostrano, between 1358 and 1369. During the Ottoman period it served as a mosque and after the British arrived it was used as a wheat store.
