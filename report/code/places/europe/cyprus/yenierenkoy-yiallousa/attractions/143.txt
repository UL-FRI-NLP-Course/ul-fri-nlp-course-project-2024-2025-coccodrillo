Karpaz Gate Marina | Cyprus, Europe |  Yenierenköy's luxury €15 million marina offers berthing for yachties in the Karpas Peninsula. For those not arriving on the island aboard their own yacht, the chief attraction is the marina's swish private beach club, complete with small white-sand beach, pool and an attractive bar-restaurant, draped in Caribbean-chic white curtains.
