Agios Thyrsos | Cyprus, Europe |  The church of Agios Thyrsos sits majestically on the seafront, with waves lapping the black rocks of the coast below. Although the church's interior is plain, it's well worth stopping off here to walk on the narrow pier just behind the church for the coastal views.
