Louma Beach | Cyprus, Europe |  A small, curving strip of beach that drops away gently and is protected by an artificial bay. The sand is fine and the water clear. Sunbathing comes with a rather picturesque view of the blue-and-white, domed Agios Nikolaos Church, which sits at the northern end of the beach.
