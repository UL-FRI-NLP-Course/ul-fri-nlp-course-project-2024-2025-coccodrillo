Traditional House | Cyprus, Europe |  Although small, this local folk museum is well worth a stop if you're passing through Paralimni â€“ if only for the exceptional enthusiasm of host Andreas, who guides visitors through the rooms, explaining the uses and history of the exhibits. The household implements, farming tools and furniture on display come from the local Paralimni area and combine to create a snapshot of traditional life.
