Eaved House | North Nicosia (Lefko≈üa), Cyprus |  Unique for its wide eaves, this house is a combination of Lusignan and Ottoman architecture and now functions as an art and culture centre hosting occasional exhibitions. The main reason to visit is for the view of the Selimiye Mosque from the upper balcony.
