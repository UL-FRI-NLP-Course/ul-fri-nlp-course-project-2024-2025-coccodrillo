Het Eerste Friese Schaatsmuseum | Friesland, The Netherlands |  In extraordinarily cold winters Hindeloopen is one of the key towns on the route of the Elfstedentocht race. This icy spectacle and ice skating in general are the museum's focus. Displays covering skating through the centuries are enthralling, as is the history of the competition.
