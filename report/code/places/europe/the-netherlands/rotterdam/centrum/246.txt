Centraal Station | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  The most used – and quite possibly best loved – building in Rotterdam, Centraal Station was designed by Benthem Crouwel, MVSA and West 8. Built between 1999 and 2013, it features a dramatically angled passenger hall with a pointed, stainless-steel clad roof that almost punches into the sky.
