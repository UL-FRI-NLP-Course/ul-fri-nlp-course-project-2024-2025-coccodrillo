Bijenkorf Department Store | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  Legendary Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer worked with Amsterdam-based architect Abraham Elzas on the design of this department store, which opened in 1957. The cladding (distinctive hexagonal travertine panels that look like honeycomb), is a nod to the department store's name: 'Beehive'. It features a monumental sculpture by Russian Constructivisit Naum Gabo on its Coolsingel facade.
