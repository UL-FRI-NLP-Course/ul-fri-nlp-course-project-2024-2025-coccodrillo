Timmerhuis | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  Designed by OMA, the 'Carpenter's House' (2009â€“15) incorporates apartments, shops, restaurants and Museum Rotterdam. Often described as a 'floating cloud' or the 'cloud house', the building's stepped steel-and-glass cubed mass does indeed seem to float above the street.
