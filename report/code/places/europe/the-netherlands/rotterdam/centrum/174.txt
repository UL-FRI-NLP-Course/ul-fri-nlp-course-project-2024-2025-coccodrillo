Natural History Museum | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  Geared predominantly towards children, the collection at this small museum focuses on delivering facts in a fun way. The 'Uitslovers' ('Show-offs') exhibit profiles the biggest, most unique and most unusual animals, while the 'Biodiversity' exhibit delivers loads of information about animal and plant species. There are also plenty of bones and fossils to look at, including the assembled skeleton of a huge Asian elephant called Ramon.
