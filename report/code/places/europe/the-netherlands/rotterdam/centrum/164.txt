McDonald's | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  Anyone who isn't convinced by Rotterdam's claim to the status of one of the world's most interesting cities of architecture need only check out the brach of McDonald's on Coolsingel. Designed by local firm MEI and opened in 2015, it features a perforated golden facade and a grand spiral staircase â€“ wonderfully different to any other branch of this fast-food favourite and a strong statement that architecture can make even the most prosaic product exciting.
