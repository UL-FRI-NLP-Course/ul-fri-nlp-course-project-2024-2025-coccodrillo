Cruise Terminal | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  Much of the Holland-America Line infrastructure in Rotterdam was destroyed during the 1940s bombings, and replaced directly after the war. This terminal building with its six distinctive shell roofs and fully glazed side elevations was one of them. Designed by Brinkman, Van den Broek & Bakema, it was completed in 1949.
