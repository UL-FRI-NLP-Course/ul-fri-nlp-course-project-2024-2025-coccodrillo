Maastoren | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  Commissioned as the Dutch headquarters of Deloitte, the 165m Maastoren was designed by Dam & Partners and was the tallest building in the Netherlands when it was completed in 2009. Its durable heating and cooling system uses water from the Maas river and energy storage in the soil to reduce the building's carbon footprint.
