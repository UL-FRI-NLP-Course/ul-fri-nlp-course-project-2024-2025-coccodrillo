Deliplein | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  Once home to the largest red-light district in Europe, Katendrecht is now one of Rotterdam’s culinary hotspots. The Deliplein is a small plaza right behind the Fenix Food Factory that houses more than 20 restaurants and bars, including upmarket steakhouse CEO and bohemian bar Café De Ouwehoer. The Theater Walhalla on the plaza's western edge sometimes stages performances in the middle of the square.
