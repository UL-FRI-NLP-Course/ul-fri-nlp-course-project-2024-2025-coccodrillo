Museum het Valkhof | Nijmegen, The Netherlands |  Changing temporary exhibitions form a substantial part of this regional history museum, at home in a striking glass shoebox-style building by Valkhof Park. Among the museum's rich collection of first-rate Roman artefacts is a column fragment from Nijmegen's Roman foundation, a replica of which doubles as a sundial on the square in front of the museum.
