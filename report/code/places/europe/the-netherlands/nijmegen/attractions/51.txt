Nationaal Fietsmuseum Velorama | Nijmegen, The Netherlands |  Down by the riverfront is this museum with more than 250 bicycles: everything from 19th-century wooden contraptions and hand-propelled bikes to an entire room devoted to penny farthings, plus more modern machines. It's a must-see for anyone who has marvelled at the Dutch affinity for two-wheelers.
