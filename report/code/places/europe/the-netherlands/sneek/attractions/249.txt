Fries Scheepvaart Museum | Friesland, The Netherlands |  Sneek has been a nexus of Frisian waterways for centuries, and this museum elegantly illustrates many aspects of shipping and seafaring in the province. Pride of place is given to models of the sk√ªtsjes and koffs that figured so largely in inland and overseas trade.
