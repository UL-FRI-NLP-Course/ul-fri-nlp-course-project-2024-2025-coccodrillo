Teylers Museum | Haarlem, The Netherlands |  Dating from 1778, Teylers is the country's oldest continuously operating museum. Its array of whizz-bang inventions includes an 18th-century electrostatic machine that conjures up visions of mad scientists. The eclectic collection also has paintings from the Dutch and French schools, and a magnificent, sky-lighted Ovale Zaal (Oval Room) displays natural-history specimens in elegant glass cases on two levels. Temporary exhibitions regularly take place. Admission includes an audioguide.
Free 90-minute guided tours in English and Dutch depart at 2pm on Sundays.
