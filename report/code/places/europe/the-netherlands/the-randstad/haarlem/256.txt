Stadhuis | Haarlem, The Netherlands |  At the western end of the Grote Markt is the florid 14th-century town hall, which sprouted many extensions, including a balcony where judgements from the high court were pronounced. It only opens to the public on Open Monuments Day (the second weekend of September).
