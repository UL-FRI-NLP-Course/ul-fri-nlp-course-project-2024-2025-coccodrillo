Leiden American Pilgrim Museum | Leiden, The Netherlands |  This museum is a fascinating restoration of a one-room house occupied around 1610 by the soon-to-be Pilgrims. The house itself dates from 1365â€“70 (check out the original 14th-century floor tiles), but the furnishings are from the Pilgrims' period. Curator Jeremy Bangs is an author who has written extensively on the Pilgrims and has a vast knowledge of their Leiden links.
