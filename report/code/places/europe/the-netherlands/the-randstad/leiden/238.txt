De Valk | Leiden, The Netherlands |  Leiden's landmark tower windmill – built in 1743 and now a museum – is considered one of the best examples of its kind. Its arms still occasionally rotate, but the last grain was ground here in 1965. Upstairs, an audiovisual presentation imparts plenty of information about windmills in the Netherlands.
