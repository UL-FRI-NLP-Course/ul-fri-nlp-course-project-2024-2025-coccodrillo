Universiteitsmuseum | Utrecht, The Netherlands |  Utrecht University's work is highlighted through exhibitions on current research plus past glories evoked through a late-19th-century classroom, historic dentistry tools and way too many models of medical maladies.
Take refuge out back in De Oude Hortus, the old botanical garden, an oasis of calm sheltering trees and plants collected by the Dutch during their world exploits. That's free with the museum ticket, â‚¬2.50 without.
