GEM | Den Haag, The Netherlands |  One of the contemporary wings of the neighbouring Gemeentemuseum, this fine art museum shares a building with the Fotomuseum Den Haag and stages a constantly changing program of exhibitions by Dutch and international visual artists. You're as likely to see video installations as you are painting, sculpture, drawing, film and photography.
