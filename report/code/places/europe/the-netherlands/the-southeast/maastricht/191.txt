Museum Aan Het Vrijthof | Maastricht, The Netherlands |  Exhibitions in this small museum change every few months but even if the current subject doesn't interest you it's worth popping your head inside.The grand cafe, accessible without entry ticket, straddles a skylit courtyard incorporating the stone loggia of a building known as the Spaans Gouvernement. It was here that Holy Roman Emperor Charles V would stay when visiting Maastricht 500 years ago.
