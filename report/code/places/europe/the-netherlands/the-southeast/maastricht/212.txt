Markt | Maastricht, The Netherlands |  The Markt, Maastricht's commercial heart, still hosts markets several times a week in the shadow of the 1664 city hall, a distinctively spired, cubic building built on the site of the original medieval cloth hall.At the north end of the square, holding a flaming rod, is a statue of Johannes Petrus Minckelers, the chap who invented gaslight.
