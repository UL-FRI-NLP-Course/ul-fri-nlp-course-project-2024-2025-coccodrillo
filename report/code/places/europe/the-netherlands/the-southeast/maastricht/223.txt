D'Artagnan Statue | Maastricht, The Netherlands |  Of countless battles and sieges that have afflicted Maastricht, the best known was in 1673 when Louis XIV's French army took the city guided by master engineer-tactician Vauban. One of the conflict's casualties was musketeer D'Artagnan whose mythologised afterlife took on an entirely fictional guise in the stories of Alexandre Dumas.
