Flevopark | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  Formerly a Jewish cemetery, this area was bought by the city in 1956, when it was turned into a park. It has a wilder, more rambling feel than Amsterdam's more central green spaces. There's a large pond, the Distilleerderij 't Nieuwe Diep gin distillery and a large outdoor swimming pool in summer.
