Nieuwendammerdijk | Amsterdam Noord, Amsterdam |  Enchanting chocolate-box prettiness characterises this long, narrow street of wooden Dutch houses, now prime real estate, with hollyhocks nodding beside every porch. Many houses date from the 1500s, and numbers 202 to 204 were where the shipbuilding family De Vries Lentsch lived. Numbers 301 to 309 were once captains' houses.
