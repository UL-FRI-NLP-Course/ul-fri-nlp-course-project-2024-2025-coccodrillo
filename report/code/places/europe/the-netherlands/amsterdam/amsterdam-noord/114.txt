EYE Film Institute | Amsterdam Noord, Amsterdam |  At this modernist architectural triumph that seems to balance on its edge on the banks of the IJ (also pronounced 'eye') River, the institute screens movies from its 40,000-title archive in four theatres, sometimes with live music. Exhibitions of costumes, digital art and other cinephile amusements run in conjunction with what's playing. A view-tastic bar-restaurant with a fabulously sunny terrace (when the sun makes an appearance) is a popular hangout on this side of the river.
The attached gift shop sells vintage film posters and a great selection of books for movie lovers.
