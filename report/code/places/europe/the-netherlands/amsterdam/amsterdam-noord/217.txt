Submarine B-80 | Amsterdam Noord, Amsterdam |  Soviet Project 611 submarine B-80, dating from 1952, was built in Severodvinsk, Russia, and previously moored in the Dutch Navy port of Den Helder in North Holland. It was brought to Amsterdam and had its interior stripped, as the owners hoped to rent it as a party venue, but it now lies as an empty, if visually arresting, shell in the harbour.
