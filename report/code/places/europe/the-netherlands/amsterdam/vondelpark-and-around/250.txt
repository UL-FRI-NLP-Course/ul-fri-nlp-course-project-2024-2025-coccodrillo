Joost van den Vondel Statue | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  Vondelpark took its name from this 1867 statue of poet and playwright Joost van den Vondel (1587â€“1679), created by sculptor Louis Royer. It was originally called Nieuwe Park (New Park), but Amsterdammers began referring to the park as Vondel's Park, which led to it being renamed.
