De Ridammerhoeve | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  A remarkable place in Amsterdamse Bos is this organic working goat farm, where kids can feed bottles of milk to, well, kids (€1 for a bottle) in season. There are goat's cheese–making workshops, and you can even do goat yoga (€26 including coffee and cake). The cafeteria sells goat’s-milk smoothies and ice cream, as well as cheeses made on the premises.
