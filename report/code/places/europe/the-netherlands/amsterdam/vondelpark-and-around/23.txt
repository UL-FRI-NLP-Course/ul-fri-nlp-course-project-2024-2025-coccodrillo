De Hallen | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  These red-brick 1902-built tram sheds were formerly used as a squat before being turned into this breathtaking skylit space. De Hallen was stunningly converted in 2014 to create a cultural complex incorporating a food hall, a brasserie, a library, design shops such as the Denim City Store and the Maker Store, a bike seller-repairer, a cinema and a hotel. Regular events held inside include themed weekend markets (such as organic produce or Dutch design); check the website for info.
A lively daily (except Sunday) street market, Ten Katemarkt, takes place outside.
