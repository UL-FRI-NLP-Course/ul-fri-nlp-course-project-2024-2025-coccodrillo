Papegaai | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  An unexpected oasis in the sea of consumerism on Kalverstraat, the curious Petrus en Pauluskerk, aka Papegaai, is a Catholic church from the 17th century that was a clandestine house of worship. Note the papegaai (parrot) over the door that gave the church its name. The slogan you'll see upon entering: '15 minutes for God'.
