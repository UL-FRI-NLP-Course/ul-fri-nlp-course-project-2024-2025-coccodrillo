Civic Guard Gallery | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  Part of the Amsterdam Museum – consider it the free ‘teaser' – this gallery fills a laneway next to the museum’s entrance. It displays 15 grand posed-group portraits, from medieval guards painted during the Dutch Golden Age (à la Rembrandt’s Night Watch) to Modern Civic Guards, a rendering of Anne Frank, Alfred Heineken and a joint-smoking personification of Mokum (the nickname for the city of Amsterdam).
