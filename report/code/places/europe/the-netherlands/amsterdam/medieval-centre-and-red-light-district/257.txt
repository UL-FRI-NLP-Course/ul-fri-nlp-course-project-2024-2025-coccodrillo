Trompettersteeg | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  An intriguing place to view the Red Light action is Trompettersteeg, a teeny alley where the women in the windows charge some of the highest prices. Claustrophobes, beware: it's only 1m wide and always busy. Look for the entrance in the block south of the Oude Kerk.
