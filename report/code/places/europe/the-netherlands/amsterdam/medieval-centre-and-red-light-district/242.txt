Rasphuis Gate | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  Directly opposite Voetboogstraat on Heiligeweg is the Rasphuis Gate, which led to a correctional institute in medieval times. The pedestal bears the sculpture of a woman with two criminals chained at her side, under the Latin word castigatio (punishment).
