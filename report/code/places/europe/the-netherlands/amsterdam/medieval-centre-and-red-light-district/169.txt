Begijnhof Kapel | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  Contained within the Begijnhof and dating from 1671, this is a 'clandestine' chapel where the Beguines were forced to worship after the Calvinists took away their Gothic church. Go through the dog-leg entrance to find marble columns, stained-glass windows and murals commemorating the Miracle of Amsterdam. After 5pm, enter from Spui.
