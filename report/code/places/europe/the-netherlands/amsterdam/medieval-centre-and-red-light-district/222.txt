Spui | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  Inviting caf√©s (pubs) and high-brow bookshops ring the Spui, a favoured haunt of academics, students and journalists. On Friday (weather permitting) a small book market sets up on the square; on Sunday it's an art market. And just so you know, it's pronounced 'spow' (rhymes with 'now').
