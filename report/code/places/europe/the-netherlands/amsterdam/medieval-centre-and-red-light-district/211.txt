Red Light Secrets | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  Inside a former brothel in a 17th-century canal house, this museum fills a gap by showing curious visitors what a Red Light room looks like and answering basic questions about the industry. There's a short film as well as photo opportunities aplenty (ahem, dominatrix room). The venue takes less than an hour to tour. Tickets are â‚¬2 cheaper online.
