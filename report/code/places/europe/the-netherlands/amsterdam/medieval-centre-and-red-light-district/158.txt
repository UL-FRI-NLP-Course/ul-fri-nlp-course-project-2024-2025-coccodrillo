Brouwerij De Prael | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  Brouwerij De Prael offers engaging behind-the-scenes tours of its brewery. Tours depart on the hour and last 40 minutes, followed by a sample (or four). The neighbouring taproom is a great place to try more of its wares. De Prael also makes liqueurs that you can buy at the brewery's attached shop.
An outpost is located in Amsterdam's rapidly growing Houthavens neighbourhood in the West.
