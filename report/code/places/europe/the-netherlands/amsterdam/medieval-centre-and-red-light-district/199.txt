Zeedijk | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  This is one of Amsterdam's oldest streets. Initially a shipping district, it was a respectable place to be until the 17th century. Then the rich folk moved away to the Herengracht, and the Zeedijk turned to come-hither entertainment for sailors. It's been cleaned up again over the past decade or so, and forms the core of Amsterdam's Chinatown as well as one of the area's gay hubs.
