Oude Hoogstraat 22 | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  Property in Amsterdam used to be taxed on frontage. So the narrower your facade, the less you paid. The slender house at Oude Hoogstraat 22 must have worked out as cheap as chips, measuring a skinny 2.02m wide, 5m deep and several storeys tall, with just 12 sq metres per storey. It now houses a tea store and a tiny tearoom.
