De Gooyer Windmill | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  This 18th-century grain mill is the sole survivor of five windmills that once stood in this part of town. It was moved to its current spot in 1814, fully renovated in 1925 and is now a private home.
The public baths alongside the windmill were converted into Brouwerij 't IJ in 1985.
