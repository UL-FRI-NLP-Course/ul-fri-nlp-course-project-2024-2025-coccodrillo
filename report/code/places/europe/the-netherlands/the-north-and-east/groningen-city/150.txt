Prinsentuin | Groningen, The Netherlands |  Take a breather at the serene gardens of Prinsenhof, a 15th-century mansion-turnedâ€“luxury hotel with peaceful Renaissance-style gardens fragranced with roses and an abundance of herbs. Don't miss the sundial.
Each year in mid-July, poets gather here from all over the Netherlands during the open-air poetry festival, Dichters in de Prinsentiun (www.dichtersindeprinsentuin.nl) for two days of poetry readings and literary romance.
