Grote Markt | Groningen, The Netherlands |  The main square holds some gems, of which the Town Hall, dating from 1810, is the most dazzling. The string of cafes along the south side are perpetually buzzing. A 1950s melange that sprang up on the east side following wartime devastation is in the process of being updated, and will aptly be known as Nieuwe Markt (New Market) when complete in late 2019.
