Dajbabe Monastery | Podgorica, Montenegro |  Even if religion isn't your bag, a trip to this unusual little working monastery is worth your while. Established in 1897, Dajbabe houses a remarkable Orthodox church inside a cave, where the low bumpy and buckling walls are slathered with religious paintings. The monk who set up the monastery worked on the artwork until his death in 1941. It's a nice cool spot on summer days.
Dajbabe is five kilometres from central Podgorica. Head south (in the direction of the airport) and watch for the signs to the monastery. A taxi shouldn't cost more than â‚¬5 each way.
