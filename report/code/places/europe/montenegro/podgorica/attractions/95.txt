St George's Church | Podgorica, Montenegro |  Sitting behind castle-like walls on the lower slopes of Gorica hill (Podgorica means 'under Gorica'), this little Orthodox church is the city's oldest. Inside, the remains of centuries-old frescoes are more interesting than the relatively modern gilded iconostasis. More fascinating still is the thoroughly creepy overgrown cemetery behind the enclosure.
