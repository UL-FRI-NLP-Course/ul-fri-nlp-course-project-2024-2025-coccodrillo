Osmanagić Mosque | Podgorica, Montenegro |  Of the two mosques within Stara Varoš, this one dating from the 18th century is the most impressive. It was beautifully restored (via Turkish donations) in 2011, following an arson attack. Inside, the windows are bordered with Arabic script and floral designs.
