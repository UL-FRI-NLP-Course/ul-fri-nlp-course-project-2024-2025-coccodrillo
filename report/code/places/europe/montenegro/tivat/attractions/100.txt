Town Beach | Tivat, Montenegro |  You're better off heading to the Lu≈°tica Peninsula for a proper swim, but Tivat does offer a couple of options if you're desperate for a dip. Town Beach is a long concrete platform with a 20m pebbly section right by the main promenade.
There's another pebbly beach, Belani, just past the marina.
