Starčevo | Lake Skadar National Park, Montenegro |  Starčevo Monastery was named somewhat unflatteringly after the hermit who founded the monastery in 1377; it translates as Old Man’s Monastery. Revived in the last three decades, Starčevo has an old man once again – a monk who would prefer not to be disturbed (entertaining tourists isn't part of the hermit job description).Starčevo's monastery and its neighbour on Beška were once famous for producing religious scripts.
