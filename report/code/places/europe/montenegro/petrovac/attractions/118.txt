Sveta Nedjelja Island | Petrovac, Montenegro |  The small church on this islet is said to have been built in gratitude by a Greek sailor who was shipwrecked here. The current church replaces one destroyed in the 1979 earthquake. Local lore has it that ringing the church bell will bring health and happiness.
