St Nicholas' Church | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |   Built in the baroque style in 1735, this medium-sized church has a Franciscan monastery attached, although the last monks left in 1908. The church was badly damaged in the 1979 earthquake but wasn't fully restored until 2011. It contains a grand Venetian-built high altar containing an oil painting of St Nicholas flanked by wooden carvings of St Peter and St Paul.
