Uvala Veslo | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |  It's rougher and rockier than most other peninsula beaches, but with super-clear water and steep rugged drop-offs, this secluded bay offers adventure galore for strong swimmers keen on snorkelling and cliff jumping. It's not one for the kids, but those seeking splendid isolation might just find their paradise here. There's a little signposted campground in an olive grove nearby.
