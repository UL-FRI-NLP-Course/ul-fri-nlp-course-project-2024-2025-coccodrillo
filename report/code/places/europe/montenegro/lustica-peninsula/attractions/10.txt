Blue Grotto | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |  A popular cruise stop, the Blue Grotto gets its name from the mesmerising effect of the light reflecting through the clear water. Boats head into the 9m-high cave and allow you an opportunity for an iridescent swim. Most boat and kayak tour operators in the region offer trips out here; opt for one that arrives early, before the crowds descend.
