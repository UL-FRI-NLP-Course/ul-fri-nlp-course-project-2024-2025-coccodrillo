Dobreč | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |  Blue-flagged Dobreč is reported to have some of the cleanest waters in Montenegro and is only accessible by sea – usually by taxi boat from Herceg Novi, though tours with Kayak Herceg Novi also stop in here. Make a day of it, as there's a good restaurant, hammocks to laze in and a little water park for the kids.
