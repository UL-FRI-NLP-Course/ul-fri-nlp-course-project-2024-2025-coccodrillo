St Nicholas’ Church | Perast, Montenegro |  This large church has never been completed, and given that it was commenced in the 17th century and the bay’s Catholic community has declined markedly since then, one suspects it never will be. Its treasury contains beautifully embroidered vestments and the remains of various saints. Climb the imposing 55m bell tower (€1) for impressive views over the bay.
