Podmaine Monastery | Budva, Montenegro |  On the surprisingly peaceful northern slopes of town, this Serbian Orthodox monastery features the same stripes of pink and honey-coloured stone as the Stari Grad's Holy Trinity Church. Interesting frescoes inside the church include a Judgement Day scene showing the fate to befall the damned (look for the communist officer with the red star on his military uniform), including being eaten alive by fish and what appears to be a chicken.
