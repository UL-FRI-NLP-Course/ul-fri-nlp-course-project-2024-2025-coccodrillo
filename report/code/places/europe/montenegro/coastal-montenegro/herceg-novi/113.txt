Archangel Michaelâ€™s Church | Herceg Novi, Montenegro |  Built between 1883 and 1905, this beautifully proportioned, domed, Serbian Orthodox church sits at the centre of gleaming white Trg Herceg Stejpana (known as Belavista to the locals). The archangel is pictured in a mosaic in the lunette above the door, under an elegant rose window.
