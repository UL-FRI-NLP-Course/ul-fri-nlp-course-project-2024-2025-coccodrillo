Šetalište Pet Danica | Herceg Novi, Montenegro |  Named after five young women named Danica who died during WWII, this pedestrian promenade stretches along the waterfront for more than 5km from Igalo to Meljine. It's lined with summer bars, shops, concrete swimming platforms and the odd rocky cove; in places it ducks in and out of tunnels carved through headlands. The strip follows the route of a former train line that once linked the coast to Sarajevo.
