Kanli Kula | Herceg Novi, Montenegro |  Kanli Kula means 'bloody tower', and this notorious 16th-century prison more than lived up to its name during Herceg Novi's years of Turkish rule (roughly 1482â€“1687); in the dungeon below the lower set of flagpoles, you can see where doomed inmates carved into the walls. The huge fort is a far more pleasant place these days, offering stupendous views over the town from its sturdy fortifications. During summer it often hosts musical and theatrical performances.
