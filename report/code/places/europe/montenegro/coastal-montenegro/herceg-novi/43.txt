Savina Monastery | Herceg Novi, Montenegro |  Named after Sava, founder of the Serbian Orthodox Church, this peaceful monastery enjoys wonderful coastal views from its location on the town's eastern slopes. It's dominated by the elegant 18th-century Church of the Dormition (Crkva uspenja Bogorodice; literally ‘the falling into sleep of the Mother of God’), carved from Croatian pinkish stone. Inside there’s a beautiful gilded iconostasis. The smaller church beside it has the same name but is considerably older (possibly 14th century) and has the remains of frescoes.
The monastery grounds also include a vineyard, part of the Savina Winery (www.castelsavina.me); the wine is sold at the monastery shop.Savina is well signposted from the large roundabout on the highway at Meljine.
