St Claire's Franciscan Church | Kotor, Montenegro |  Aside from a fine rose window there's not much ornamentation on the facade of this Catholic church, built between the 14th and 17th centuries. But head inside for the full Venetian baroque experience, with cherubs floating around the high altar, holding aloft realistic-looking draperies carved entirely from marble.
