Gurdić Gate | Kotor, Montenegro |  Fewer tourists make it to the south end of town, where the houses narrow into a slim corridor leading to this bastion and gate (parts of which date from the 13th century) and the drawbridge over the Gurdić Spring. Without the crowds and the clamour, it's easy to imagine yourself transported in time as you meander along the atmospheric passageways.
