Maritime Museum of Montenegro | Kotor, Montenegro |  Kotor's proud history as a naval power is celebrated in three storeys of displays housed in a wonderful early-18th-century palace. An audio guide helps explain the collection of photographs, paintings, uniforms, exquisitely decorated weapons and models of ships.
Just outside the museum, look out for the Karampana Well and its ornate wrought-iron fence; for centuries, this tiny well provided all of Kotor's fresh drinking water.
