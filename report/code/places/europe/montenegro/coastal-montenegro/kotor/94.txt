River Gate | Kotor, Montenegro |  Tucked in the slightly quieter northern corner of town beside the parklike Trg od Drva (Wood Sq), this gate opens on to a photogenic moat formed by the clear mountain water of the bubbling Å kurda River. It was built in 1540 to commemorate the attack on the city the previous year by the Ottoman navy. You'll invariably be greeted by a Kotor cat (or 20).
