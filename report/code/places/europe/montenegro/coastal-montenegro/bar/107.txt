St Nicholas’ Church | Adriatic Coast, Montenegro |  Bar first became the seat of a Catholic diocese in the 9th century and in 1089 it was elevated to an archdiocese, with the archbishop given the title ‘Primate of Serbia’. The elegant archbishop’s palace sits next to this baroque-style church in the west of town on the route to Stari Bar.
