Liberty Monument | Ulcinj, Montenegro |  On the cliff above Mala Plaža, this imposing monument is a lovely piece of socialist art that’s now neglected and covered in graffiti. Its two V-shaped white segments resemble a pair of fighter planes that have crash-landed on their noses. Closer inspection reveals them as stylised wings sprouting from the figures facing each other at the centre.
