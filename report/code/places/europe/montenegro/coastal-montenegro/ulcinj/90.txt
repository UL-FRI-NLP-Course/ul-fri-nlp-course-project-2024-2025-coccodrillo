St Nicholas’ Cathedral | Ulcinj, Montenegro |  Colourful frescoes fill this Serbian Orthodox cathedral, set among a picturesque grove of gnarled olive trees just below the main gate to the Old Town. It’s a relative newbie, having been built in 1890 shortly after the Ottomans were booted out, although it’s believed to stand on the site of a 15th-century monastery.
