Ladies' Beach | Ulcinj, Montenegro |  This lovely, boulder-strewn little cove – and its cave – are strictly for the ladies. It was given its name and status thanks to the high level of sulphur in the deep green water, said to be an excellent natural treatment for infertility. Local women often swim naked here. If you're not in possession of XX chromosomes, don't even think about it: the area is respected (and guarded) as a haven for women.
