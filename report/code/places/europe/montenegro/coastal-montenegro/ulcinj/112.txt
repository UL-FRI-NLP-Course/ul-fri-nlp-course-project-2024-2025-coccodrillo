Sapore di Mare | Ulcinj, Montenegro |  This pine-fringed rocky beach makes for a good break from the blaring pop and incessant preening of some of the more populated strips of sand near Mala Pla≈æa. Despite the lack of sand, it's a good spot for swimming and sunning. There's a nice pizzeria and bar on the concreted terrace.
