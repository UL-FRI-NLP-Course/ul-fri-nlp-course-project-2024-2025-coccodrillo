Gospa od Milosti | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |  The diminutive Gospa od Milosti was once the residence of Kotorâ€™s Catholic bishops and is now a convent. A wooden statue of the Madonna kept in the church is said to have miraculous powers. Pop over for a look on a taxi boat from Tivat or Herceg Novi.
