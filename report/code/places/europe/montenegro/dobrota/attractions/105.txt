St Matthew's Church | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |  The older of Dobrota's two Catholic churches, St Matthew's (1670) wears a baroque frontage, a well-proportioned dome and a tall steeple. You'll hear its bells, but getting within its walls is another story. It's rarely open, which is a shame; word has it there's a painting of St Nicholas by Novelli inside.
