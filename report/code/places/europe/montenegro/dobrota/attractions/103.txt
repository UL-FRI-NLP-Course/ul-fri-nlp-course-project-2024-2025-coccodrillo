Žuta Plaža | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |   Dobrota is effectively Kotor’s beach suburb. Private swimming platforms take up much of the waterline, but this pebbly stretch closest to Kotor is open to everybody. It's a beautiful spot for a swim, with the sheer mountain walls looming above, but it should be noted that there have been problems with water quality here.
