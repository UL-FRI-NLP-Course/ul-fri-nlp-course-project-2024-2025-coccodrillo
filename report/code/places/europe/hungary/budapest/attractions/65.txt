Nagytétény Castle Museum | Budapest, Hungary |  Housed in the huge Száraz-Rudnyánszky baroque mansion in deepest south Buda, this branch of the Museum of Applied Arts traces the development of European furniture – from Gothic (1450) to Biedermeier styles (1850) – with some 300 items on display in more than two-dozen rooms over two floors. On no account miss the collection of clocks and watches dating from the 17th to 19th centuries – each piece is genuine and fully functional. The museum was closed for renovation at research time.
