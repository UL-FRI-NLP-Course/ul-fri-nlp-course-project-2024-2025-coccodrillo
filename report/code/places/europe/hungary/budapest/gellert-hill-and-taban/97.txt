St Gellért Monument | Budapest, Hungary |  Gazing down on Elizabeth Bridge from Gellért Hill is a large and quite theatrical monument to St Gellért, an Italian missionary invited to Hungary by King Stephen to convert the natives. The monument marks the spot where, according to legend, the pagan Magyars, resisting the new faith, hurled the bishop to his death in a spiked barrel in 1046.
