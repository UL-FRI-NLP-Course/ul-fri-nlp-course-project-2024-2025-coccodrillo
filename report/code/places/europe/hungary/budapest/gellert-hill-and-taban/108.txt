Queen Elizabeth Statue | Budapest, Hungary |  Northwest of Elizabeth Bridge is a statue of the Habsburg empress and Hungarian queen, Elizabeth. Consort to Franz Joseph, 'Sissi' was much loved by the Magyars because, among other things, she learned to speak Hungarian. She was assassinated by a deranged Italian anarchist in Geneva in 1898 with a sharpened needle file.
