Liberty Bridge | Budapest, Hungary |  Liberty Bridge, with its fin-de-si√®cle cantilevered span, was opened in time for the Millenary Exhibition in 1896. The bridge was originally named after Habsburg Emperor Franz Joseph, and each of its posts is topped by a mythical turul (an eagle-like totem of the ancient Magyars and a national symbol) ready to take flight. It was rebuilt in the same style immediately after WWII.
