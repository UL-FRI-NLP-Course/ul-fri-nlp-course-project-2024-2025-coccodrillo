Hungarian Museum of Trade & Tourism | Óbuda & Buda Hills, Budapest |  This superb museum traces Budapest's catering and hospitality trade through the ages, including the dramatic changes after WWII, with restaurant items, tableware, advertising posters, packaging, original shop signs and advertising. There's also an intimate look at the lives of various tradespeople – from pastry chefs and publicans to hoteliers and launderers. Go upstairs for some cutting-edge temporary exhibits. A gem.
