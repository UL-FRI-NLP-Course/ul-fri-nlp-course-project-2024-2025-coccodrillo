Margaret Bridge | Budapest, Hungary |  Renovated Margaret Bridge introduces the Big Ring Rd to Buda. It's unique in that it doglegs in order to stand at right angles to the Danube where it converges at the southern tip of Margaret Island. The bridge was originally built by French engineer Ernest Go√ºin in 1876; the spur leading to the island was added in 1901.
