Musical Well | Budapest, Hungary |  Just north of the Japanese Garden, on a raised gazebo, is the revamped Musical Fountain. A replica of one in Marosvásárhely (now Târgu Mureș) in Transylvania, it plays Hungarian melodies every hour on the hour and a four-trombone ditty on the half-hour. At ground level are three taps pumping out potable well water.
