Premonstratensian Church | Budapest, Hungary |  This Romanesque Premonstratensian Church, dedicated to St Michael by the order of White Canons and reconstructed in 1931, dates back originally to the 12th century. Its 15th-century bell mysteriously appeared one night in 1914 under the roots of a walnut tree knocked over in a storm. It was probably buried by monks during the Turkish invasion.
