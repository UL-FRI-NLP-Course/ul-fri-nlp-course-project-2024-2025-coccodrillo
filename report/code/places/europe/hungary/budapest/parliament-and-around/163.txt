Ferenc Deák Statue | Budapest, Hungary |  On the southern end of V Széchenyi István tér is a statue of Ferenc Deák, the Hungarian minister largely responsible for the Compromise of 1867, which brought about the Dual Monarchy of Austria and Hungary. The statue on the western side is of an Austrian and a Hungarian child holding hands in peaceful bliss. The Magyar kid's hair is tousled and he is naked; the Osztrák is demurely covered by a bit of the patrician's robe and his hair is neatly coiffed.
