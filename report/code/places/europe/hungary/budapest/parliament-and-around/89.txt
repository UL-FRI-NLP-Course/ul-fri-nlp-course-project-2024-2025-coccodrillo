Holy Right Chapel | Budapest, Hungary |  This chapel in the Basilica of St Stephen contains the Holy Right (also known as the Holy Dexter), the mummified right hand of King St Stephen and an object of great devotion. It was returned to Hungary by Habsburg empress Maria Theresa in 1771 after it was discovered in a monastery in Bosnia. The chapel was being extensively renovated at the time of research and was not due reopen before 2020.
