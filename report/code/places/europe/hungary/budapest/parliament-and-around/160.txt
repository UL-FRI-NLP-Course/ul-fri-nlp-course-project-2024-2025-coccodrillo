Kossuth Lajos tér | Budapest, Hungary |  Northwest of Szabadság tér, this square is the site of Parliament, Budapest’s most photographed building. The square reopened in 2014 after being restored to its original prewar plans. It is now a traffic-free zone with a sustainable park, sculptures of the great and the good, an underground lapidary and a memorial to the victims of the Kossuth Lajos tér massacre of 25 October 1956.
