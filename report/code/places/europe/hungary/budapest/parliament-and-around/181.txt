National Bank of Hungary | Budapest, Hungary |  Southeast of Szabadság tér are some of the most beautiful buildings in Pest, including the National Bank of Hungary. It has terracotta reliefs on all four sides that illustrate trade and commerce through history: Arab camel traders, African rug merchants, Egyptian grain farmers, Chinese tea salesmen and the inevitable solicitor witnessing contracts.
