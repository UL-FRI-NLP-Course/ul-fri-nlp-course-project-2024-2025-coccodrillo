Károly Garden | Budapest, Hungary |  A pleasant place to take a breather, this flowered-filled garden was built for the Károly Palace, which now houses the Petőfi Museum of Literature. Frequented by locals, many with families (it has a lovely little playground), the garden is a riot of colourful flower beds in the spring and summer months, and there are plenty of shady benches.
Csendes Társ is an atmospheric spot for a sundowner or snack, with a little terrace of tables crowded round the park's entrance gate.
