Egyetem tér | Budapest, Hungary |  Boasting a fountain, abstract sculpture, benches and shade sails, ‘University Sq’ takes its name from the branch of the prestigious Loránd Eötvös Science University located here. Attached to the main university building to the west is the lovely baroque University Church (1742). Over the altar is a copy of the Black Madonna of Czȩstochowa so revered in Poland.
