Párisi Udvar | Budapest, Hungary |  Built in 1909, Párisi Udvar is a stunning, ornately decorated piece of Eclectic architecture, with Moorish, Gothic and art nouveau elements. It was for decades a delightful but down-at-heel shopping arcade but is currently receiving a top-to-bottom renovation and will reopen as a 130-room Hyatt hotel some time in 2019.
