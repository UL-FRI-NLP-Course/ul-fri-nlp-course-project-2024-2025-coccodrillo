Vörösmarty tér | Budapest, Hungary |  At the northern end of Váci utca lies Vörösmarty tér, a large square surrounded by smart shops, galleries and cafes. In the centre is a statue of Mihály Vörösmarty, the 19th-century poet for whom the square is named. Made of somewhat brittle Italian marble, it is protected in winter by a bizarre plastic ‘iceberg’ that kids love sliding on.
