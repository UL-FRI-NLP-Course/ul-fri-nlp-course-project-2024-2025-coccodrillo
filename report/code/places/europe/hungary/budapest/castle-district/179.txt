Clark Ádám tér | Castle District, Budapest |  Clark Ádám tér, the square named after the 19th-century Scottish engineer Adam Clark (1811–66) who supervised the building of the Szécheny Chain Bridge (Széchenyi lánchíd), leading east from the square. He also designed the all-important tunnel (alagút) under Castle Hill, which opened to traffic three years after it was started in 1853.
