Dobó István tér | Eger, Hungary |  Statues of István Dobó and his comrades-in-arms routing the Turks fill Eger’s main square, which has been totally revamped in recent years. To the south is the splendid Minorite church, built in 1771 and one of the most beautiful baroque buildings in the world. Just north of and visible from the square is the 40m-tall minaret.
