Belgrade Cathedral | Szentendre, Hungary |  Just north of Castle Hill is the red tower of Belgrade Cathedral, completed in 1764 and seat of the Serbian Orthodox bishop in Hungary, when Hungary had a large Serbian population. It's worth peeking inside at the beautiful interior furnished with New Testament icons.
