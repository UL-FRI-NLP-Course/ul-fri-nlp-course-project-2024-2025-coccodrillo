Požarevačka Church | Szentendre, Hungary |  Dedicated in 1763, this late-baroque Serbian Orthodox church has a lovely iconostasis dating from 1742. The church is on the way into town from the bus and train stations and a good introduction to Szentendre's predominant architecture. It's sometimes inexplicably closed.
