Fő tér | Szentendre, Hungary |  Colourful Fő tér, the town’s main square, contains many buildings, monuments and churches from the 18th and 19th centuries, including the Memorial Cross in its centre – the town's way of thanking the plague epidemic for passing by Szentendre in 1763. The pedestrian lanes surrounding the square are filled with shops selling gift items and folk crafts.
