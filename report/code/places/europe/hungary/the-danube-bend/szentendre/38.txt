Art Mill | Szentendre, Hungary |  This enormous gallery, spread over three floors of an old mill at the northern end of town, exhibits cutting-edge photography, light and sound installations, sculpture, paintings and works in other media by both local and national artists. It really does underscore Szentendreâ€™s renewed commitment to being a centre for serious art.
