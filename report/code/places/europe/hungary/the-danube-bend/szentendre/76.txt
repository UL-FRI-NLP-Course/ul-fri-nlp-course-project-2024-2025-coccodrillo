Hungarian Open-Air Ethnographical Museum | Szentendre, Hungary |  Just 5km northwest of Szentendre is Hungary's most ambitious skanzen (open-air folk museum displaying village architecture), with farmhouses, churches, bell towers, mills and so on set up in eight regional divisions. Craftspeople and artisans do their thing on random days (generally on weekends) from Easter to early December, and the museum hosts festivals throughout the season. Reach it on bus 230 from bay 7 at the bus station.
