Cella Septichora Visitors Centre | PÃ©cs, Hungary |  This Christian burial site illuminates a series of early Christian tombs that have been on Unesco's World Heritage list since 2000. The highlight is the so-called Jug Mausoleum, a 4th-century Roman tomb; its name comes from a painting of a large drinking vessel with vines.
