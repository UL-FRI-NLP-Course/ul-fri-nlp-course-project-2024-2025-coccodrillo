Busóház | Lake Balaton & Southern Transdanubia, Hungary |  If you can’t make the Busójárás festival, just before Lent, Busóház is the place to come: it tells the story of the festival from its origins as a South Slav spring rite to a fancy-dress mummery directed at the erstwhile enemy, the Turks. The horrifying devils' and rams' head masks are on frightening display.
