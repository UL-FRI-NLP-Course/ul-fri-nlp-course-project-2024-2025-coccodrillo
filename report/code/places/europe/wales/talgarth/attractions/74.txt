Bronllys Castle | Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog, Wales |  Looking like it's slid straight off a chess board, Bronllys' circular tower was built in 1230 on the site of an earlier Norman motte-and-bailey castle. You can climb up inside, wander around its three floors and gaze out over the verdant countryside through its little Gothic windows. It's located just outside of town, on the A479 heading northwest.
