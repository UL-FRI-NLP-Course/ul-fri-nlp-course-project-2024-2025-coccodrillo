Garn Goch | Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog, Wales |  You're likely to have the impressive remains of Garn Goch to yourself. One of the largest Iron Age sites in Wales, it comprises a smaller hill fort covering 1.5 hectares, and a much larger one of 11.2 hectares. While what you now see are immense piles of rubble, it's sobering to know that these were once 10m-high ramparts, faced with stone and 5m thick. From the top, jaw-dropping views of Black Mountain country roll to every point of the compass.
To get here, follow the signs from Llangadog through Bethlehem village and into the hills beyond.
