Ruthin Craft Centre | Snowdonia & the Llŷn, Wales |  This is an excellent gallery and arts hub. Aside from the three galleries – which do great work bringing the best of local photography, painting and sculpture to light, and show many pieces for sale – the complex includes artists' studios, public workshops and talks, a very nice cafe and shop, and an unstaffed information centre.
