Porthkerry Country Park | Wales, Europe |  Spanning 90 hectares, this vast expanse follows a lush wooded valley terminating at a pebbly beach, overshot by an impressive Victorian railway viaduct. There are plenty of trails, a popular playground for the kids, the remains of a 13th-century mill and the potential to spot buzzards, adders and foxes. The park is well signposted from the road to Barry Island.
