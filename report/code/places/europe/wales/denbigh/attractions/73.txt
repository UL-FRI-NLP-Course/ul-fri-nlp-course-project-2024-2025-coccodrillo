Burgess Gate | Snowdonia & the Ll≈∑n, Wales |  This twin-towered gate, dating to the construction of the walled town in the 13th century, once commanded the main entrance to medieval Denbigh. Despite its partly ruinous state, pocked with Civil War small-cannon shot, its original imposing dimensions are clear to see. Within, illustrated panels trace the history of Denbigh and its fortifications.
