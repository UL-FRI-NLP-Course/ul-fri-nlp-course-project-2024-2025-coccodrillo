Conwy Valley Railway Museum | Snowdonia National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri), Wales |  If you're the sort who's fascinated by dioramas and model train sets, this tiny museum is for you. In which case the model shop you have to pass through in order to enter might pose an unfair temptation. The big attraction for kids is the miniature steam-train ride (the 1-mile round trip through manicured gardens costs Â£2, and is sometimes diesel-powered) and there's a cafe in a full-sized carriage.
