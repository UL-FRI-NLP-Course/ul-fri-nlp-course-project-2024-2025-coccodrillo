Quarry Hospital Museum | Snowdonia National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri), Wales |  Built in 1860 to minister to workers injured in rockfalls and the other mishaps inseparable from slate mining, this museum provides a vivid insight into the sometimes gruesome medical care provided in Victorian times. The hospital is part of Padarn Country Park, on the northeastern shore of Llyn Padarn.
