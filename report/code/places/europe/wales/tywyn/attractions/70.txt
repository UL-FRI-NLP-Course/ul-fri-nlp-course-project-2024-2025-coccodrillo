Narrow Gauge Railway Museum | Snowdonia National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri), Wales |  At Tywyn Wharf Station, the terminus of the Talyllyn Railway, this museum is one for steam-locomotive buffs. Its 1000-plus artefacts date as far as 200 years back, telling the stories of British narrow-gauge railways and the volunteers who fought to preserve Talyllyn. There are regular temporary exhibitions, and opening hours are coordinated with the train timetable.
