Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal | Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog, Wales |  Brecon is the northern terminus of this canal, built between 1799 and 1812 for the movement of coal, iron ore, limestone and agricultural goods. The 33 miles from Brecon to Pontypool is back in business, transporting a generally less grimy cargo of holidaymakers and river-dwellers. The busiest section is around Brecon, with craft departing from the canal basin, 400m south of the town centre.
A peaceful 8.5-mile walk along the towpath leads to the picturesque village of Talybont-on-Usk. You can return on the X43 bus (two daily, no Sunday service).
