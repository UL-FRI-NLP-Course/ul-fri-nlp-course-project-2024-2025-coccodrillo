Crug Hywel | Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog, Wales |  Distinctive flat-topped Crug Hywel (Hywel's Rock; 451m), better known as Table Mountain, rises to the north of Crickhowell and gave the town its name. You can do a steep but satisfying hike to the impressive remains of an Iron Age fort, which occupy the entire summit. The tourist office has a leaflet detailing the 4Â½-mile, three-hour round-trip route.
