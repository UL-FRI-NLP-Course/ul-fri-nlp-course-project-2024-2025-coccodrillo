Penarth Pier Pavilion | Wales, Europe |  Penarth's rock-strewn shoreline may not be particularly attractive but it is the closest beach to Cardiff. In 1894 it was graced with that icon of the Victorian seaside, a pier. This elegant art deco pavilion followed in 1927, but it went into decline and for decades was left to decay. Following major restorations the pavilion has now reopened, complete with a gallery, cinema and cafe.
