National Gallery of Kosovo | Pristina, Kosovo |  This excellent space approaches Kosovan art from a contemporary perspective (don't expect to see paintings from the country's history here) and is worth a look around. Exhibitions change frequently and the gallery space is normally given over to a single artist at any one time. At the time of research, the 'art' included a stable of live cows.
It hosts the annual exhibition for the Muslim Mulliqi Prize, the country's leading contemporary visual arts award, around which an exhibition is created each year, guest-curated by a leading art-world figure.
