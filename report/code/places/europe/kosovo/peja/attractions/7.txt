Cheese Market | Kosovo, Europe |  The town's bustling daily bazaar makes you feel like you've just arrived in Ä°stanbul, and it's a great place to see local farmers and artisans hawking their wares. The highlight is when farmers gather in a busy courtyard at the centre of the market area each Saturday with wooden barrels of goat's cheese. You can actually just follow your nose and you'll find it.
