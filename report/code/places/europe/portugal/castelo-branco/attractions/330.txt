Castelo | The Beiras, Portugal |  Thereâ€™s little left of Castelo Branco's hilltop castle, which was built by the Knights Templar in the 13th century and subsequently extended by Dom Afonso IV a century or so later. Nowadays, a phone mast stands where the chapel once was and a garden has supplanted the walls. However, there are grand views to be enjoyed and the old lanes up from the town centre are picturesque, if a little dilapidated.
