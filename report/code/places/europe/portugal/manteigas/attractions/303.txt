Poço do Inferno | Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela, Portugal |  This waterfall, which descends the steep gorge of Ribeira de Lenadres, is a magnificent spectacle, particularly in spring. To get there from Manteigas, drive about 4km along the main road towards Torre. Just beyond Caldas de Manteigas, turn left and climb a further 6km to the falls through a lush evergreen forest. Alternatively, there's a popular walking route to the falls – check www.manteigastrilhosverdes.com for details.
