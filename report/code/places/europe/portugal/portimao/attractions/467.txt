Igreja Matriz | Portimão, Portugal |  The town’s parish church stands on high ground to the north of the centre. A 15th-century Gothic portal and a gargoyle are all that remain of the original structure after the 1755 earthquake. Its interior is decorated with azulejos (hand-painted tiles) and neoclassical and neobaroque gilding.
