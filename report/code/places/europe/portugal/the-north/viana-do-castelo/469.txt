FÃ¡brica do Chocolate | Viana do Castelo, Portugal |  This small five-room museum devoted to chocolate is fun and interactive, treating you to tidbits of facts and curiosities, but it's also often packed with school groups. There's a free audioguide to take you through the exhibits and you get to put on a white coat and make a bar of chocolate at the end.
