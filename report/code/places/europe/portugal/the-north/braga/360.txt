GNRation | Braga, Portugal |  This spiffy modern cultural centre lives inside an 18th-century building that once housed police headquarters. Enter through the sliding glass doors and you're inside an incubator of the city's creative industry, with galleries, concerts, film screenings, workshops and theatre performances. Free guided tours are available with advance notice (call or contact info@gnration.pt).
