Praia do Cabedelo do Douro | Porto, Portugal |  Nothing blows away the city cobwebs like a wander along this beach, fringed by the protected dunes of the Douro Estuary Nature Reserve. The stiff sea breezes draw kitesurfers here, but it's also a relaxed spot to kick back on the sand and watch the gentle rise and fall of the Atlantic â€“ especially as sunset pinkens the sky.
