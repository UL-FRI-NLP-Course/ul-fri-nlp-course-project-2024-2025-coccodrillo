Convento de São Pedro de Alcântara | Bairro Alto, Chiado & Cais do Sodré, Lisbon |  This convent is small in size but grand in baroque decor. The inconspicuous box-like facade hides a chapel (1690s), and a church (1681) that survived the 1755 earthquake and is greatly ornamented, with blue-and-white tile-covered walls and intricate Italian-inspired marble floors. Access is through the side door. Guided English tours (€2.50) go deeper on Fridays at 3pm.
