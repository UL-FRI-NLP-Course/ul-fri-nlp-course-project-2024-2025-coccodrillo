Convento dos Cardaes | Bairro Alto, Chiado & Cais do Sodr√©, Lisbon |  The inconspicuous, graffitied white facade of this 17th-century fort-like convent contrasts with the rich blue-and-white tiles and gilded carvings of the church inside. As one of the few buildings that remained intact after the 1755 earthquake, the convent is a rare example of the Portuguese baroque style in Lisbon. Guided tours take about an hour.
