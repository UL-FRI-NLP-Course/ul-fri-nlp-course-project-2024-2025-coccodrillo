Museu de Marinha | Belém, Lisbon |  The Museu de Marinha is a nautical flashback to the Age of Discoveries, with its armadas of model ships, cannonballs and shipwreck booty. Dig for buried treasure such as Vasco da Gama’s portable wooden altar, 17th-century globes (note Australia’s absence) and the polished private quarters of UK-built royal yacht Amélia. A separate building houses royal barges, 19th-century firefighting machines and seaplanes.
