Museu Nacional de Arqueologia | Belém, Lisbon |  Housed in the western wing of Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, the intriguing stash here contains mesolithic flint stones, Egyptian mummies inside elaborately painted sarcophagi, and beautifully wrought Bronze Age jewellery. Even more curious is the collection of statues dedicated to Roman deities.
