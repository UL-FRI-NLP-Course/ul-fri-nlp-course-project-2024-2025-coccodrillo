Jardim Botânico Tropical | Belém, Lisbon |  Far from the madding crowd, these botanical gardens bristle with hundreds of species, from date palms to monkey-puzzle trees. Spread across 7 hectares, it’s a peaceful, shady retreat on a sweltering summer’s day. A highlight is the Macau garden, complete with mini pagoda, where bamboo rustles and a cool stream trickles.
Tots will love clambering over the gnarled roots of a banyan tree and spotting the waddling ducks and geese.
