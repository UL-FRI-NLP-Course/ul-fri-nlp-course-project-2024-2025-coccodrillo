Castelo de São Filipe | Setúbal, Portugal |  Worth the 500m schlep uphill to the west, the castle was built by Filipe I in 1590 to fend off an English attack on the invincible Armada. Converted into a pousada in the 1960s, its hulking ramparts afford precipitous views, and its chapel is festooned in blue-and-white 18th-century azulejos. It reopened in 2017 after stabilisation renovations.
