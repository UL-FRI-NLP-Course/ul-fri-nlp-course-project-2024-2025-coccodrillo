Praça do Bocage | Setúbal, Portugal |  All streets in the pedestrianised old town seem to lead to this mosaic-cobbled square, presided over by the arcaded bright-purple town hall. It’s a sunny spot for a wander amid the palms and fountains, or for coffee and people-watching on one of the pavement terraces.
