Jardim da Cerca da Graça | Alfama, Castelo & Graça, Lisbon |  Closed for centuries, this 1.7-hectare green space opened again in 2015 and is Lisbon's second-biggest park, offering a lush transition between the neighbourhoods of Graça and Mouraria. There are superb city and castle views from several points and a shady picnic park along with a playground, an orchard and a peaceful kiosk with a terrace.
Load up on wine and cheese and call it an afternoon here!
