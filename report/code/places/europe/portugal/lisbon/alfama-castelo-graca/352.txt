Museu de Artes Decorativas | Alfama, Castelo & Graça, Lisbon |  Set in a petite 17th-century palace, this museum creaks under the weight of treasures including blingy French silverware, priceless Qing vases and Indo-Chinese furniture – a collection amassed by a wealthy Portuguese banker from the age of 16. It’s worth a visit just to admire the lavish apartments, embellished with baroque azulejos, frescoes and chandeliers.
