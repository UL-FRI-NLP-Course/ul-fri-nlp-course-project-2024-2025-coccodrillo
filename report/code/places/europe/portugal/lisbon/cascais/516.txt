Boca do Inferno | Cascais, Portugal |  Atlantic waves pummel the craggy 'Mouth of Hell', 2km west of Cascais. It's about a 20-minute walk along the coast, or you can catch the BusCas (427) from Cascais station (â‚¬1, every 10 to 15 minutes). Expect a mouthful of small splashes unless a storm is raging.
