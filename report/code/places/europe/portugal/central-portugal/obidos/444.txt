Museu Municipal | Óbidos, Portugal |  Located in an 18th-century manor house just next to Igreja de Santa Maria, the town’s museum houses a small collection of paintings spanning several centuries. The highlight is a haunting portrait by Josefa de Óbidos, Beneficiado Faustino das Neves (1670), remarkable for its dramatic use of light and shade.
