Núcleo da Cidade Muralhada/Torre de Almedina | Coimbra, Portugal |  Housed in the medieval tower over the Arco de Almedina, this small museum has a plaster cast of the city's early layout, complete with castle and defensive walls, and an audiovisual presentation of its 2km of walls. Up top you can enjoy fine rooftop views and look down through the matacães (embrasures), through which hot oil was traditionally poured on enemies below.
