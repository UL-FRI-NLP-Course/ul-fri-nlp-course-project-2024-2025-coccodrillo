Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Conceição | Tomar, Portugal |  Downhill from the monastery is this strikingly simple Renaissance chapel in a lovely position. It’s attributed to Diogo de Torralva, architect of the Convento de Christo cloisters. To visit, you (or your guide) will need to make prior arrangements at the Convent.
