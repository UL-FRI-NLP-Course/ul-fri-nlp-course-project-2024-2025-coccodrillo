Igreja da Nossa Senhora da Graça | Évora, Portugal |  Down an alley off Rua da República is the curious baroque facade of this church, topped by four ungainly stone giants – as if they’ve strayed from a mythological tale and landed on a religious building. An early example of the Renaissance style in Portugal is found in the cloister of the 17th-century monastery next door. The church is rarely open.
