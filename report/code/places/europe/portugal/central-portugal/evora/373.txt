Ermida de São Brás | Évora, Portugal |  The crenellated, pointy-topped Arabian Gothic Ermida de São Brás dates from about 1480. It’s possibly an early project of Diogo de Boitaca, considered the originator of the Manueline style. It was constructed under orders from Dom João II, on the grounds of a small leprosarium where plague victims were treated. It keeps irregular hours (and is usually closed).
