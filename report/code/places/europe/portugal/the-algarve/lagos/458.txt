Igreja de Santa Maria | Lagos, Portugal |  The symmetrical Igreja de Santa Maria was built during the 15th and 16th centuries and retains a 16th-century entrance; the rest of the remaining structure dates largely from the mid-19th century, when it was restored after a fire. Behind the altar is an unusual orange-and-purple mural depicting battling angels.
