Museu de Cera dos Descobrimentos | Lagos, Portugal |  Unlike typical celebrity-filled wax museums, this one has 22 historic wax figures representing 16 different points in time during Portugal's Age of Discovery. They include Prince Henry the Navigator, Gil Eanes, Pope Alexander VI and Ferdinand Magellan (the first navigator credited with sailing across the Pacific). It's engaging for kids and adults alike; information panels are in English and Portuguese.
