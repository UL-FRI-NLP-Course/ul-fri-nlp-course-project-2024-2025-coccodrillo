Town Walls | Lagos, Portugal |  On the western side of the centre is a restored section of the stout town walls, built (atop earlier versions) during the reigns of both Manuel I and Jo√£o III in the 16th century, when the walls were enlarged to the existing outline. The defensive structures extend intermittently, with at least six bastions, for about 1.5km around the central zone.
