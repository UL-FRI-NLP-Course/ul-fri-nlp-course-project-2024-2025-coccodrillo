Fortaleza da Ponta da Bandeira | Lagos, Portugal |  Entered via a drawbridge, this petite fortress was built in the 17th century to protect the port. Now restored, it houses an exhibition on the Portuguese Age of Discovery and a beautifully tiled chapel dedicated to Santa Barbara, often invoked as a protector against storms.
