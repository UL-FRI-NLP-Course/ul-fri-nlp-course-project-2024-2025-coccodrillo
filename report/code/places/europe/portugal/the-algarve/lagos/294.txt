Antigo Mercado de Escravos | Lagos, Portugal |  Set in the building believed to be Europe's first slave market, when slaves from the west coast of Africa were brought here in 1444, this small museum recounts the grim history of slavery in Lagos and the Algarve region, which continued until 1761. Exhibition spaces detail the lives of the enslaved through interpretation panels in English and Portuguese, with pop-up information and animations on free augmented reality multimedia guides.
