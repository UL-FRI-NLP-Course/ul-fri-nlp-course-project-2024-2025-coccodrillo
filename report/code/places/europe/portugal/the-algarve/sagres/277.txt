Fortaleza do Beliche | Sagres, Portugal |  Built in 1632 on the site of an older fortress, Fortaleza do Beliche is 4.8km northwest of the town centre, and 1.2km southeast of the lighthouse at Cabo de SÃ£o Vicente. Although it once housed a hotel, erosion has made the ground unstable and the interior is off-limits to visitors, but you can go through the walls to the seaward side and descend a pretty pathway down to near the water.
The sheltering walls here protect picnickers from the wind.
