Igreja da Miseric√≥rdia | Tavira, Portugal |  Built between 1541 and 1551, this church is the Algarve's most important Renaissance monument, with a magnificent carved, arched doorway. Inside, the restrained Renaissance arches contrast with the cherub-festooned baroque altar and enormous panels of azulejos depicting the works of mercy. Fado performances are sublime here.Behind is a museum with salvers, chalices, and a hall with an interesting 18th-century applewood ceiling and elegant furniture.
