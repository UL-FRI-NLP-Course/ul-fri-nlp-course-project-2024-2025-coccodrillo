Quatro Águas | Tavira, Portugal |  You can walk 2km east along the river, past the fascinating, snowlike salt pans to Quatro Águas. The salt pans produce tip-top table salt and attract feeding birds in summer, including flamingos. It's the jumping-off point for ferries to Ilha de Tavira and has a couple of simple seafood restaurants.
