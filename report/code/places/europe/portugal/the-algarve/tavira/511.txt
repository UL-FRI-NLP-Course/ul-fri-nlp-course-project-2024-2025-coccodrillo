Praça da República | Tavira, Portugal |  For centuries this town square on the riverfront served as a promenade and a marketplace, where slaves were traded along with fish and fruit. Today a large part has been remodelled as an amphitheatre, and is covered with tables that spill from the square's many cafes.
