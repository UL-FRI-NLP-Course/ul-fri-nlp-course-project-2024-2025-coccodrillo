Arco de Repouso | Faro, Portugal |  You can leave the Cidade Velha (Old Town) through the medieval Arco de Repouso (Gate of Rest). Apparently Afonso III, after taking Faro from the Moors, put his feet up and heard Mass nearby. Around the gateway are some of the town walls' oldest sections â€“ Afonso III's improvements on the Moorish defences.
