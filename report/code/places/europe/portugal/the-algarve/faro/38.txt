Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Carmo & Capela dos Ossos | Faro, Portugal |  One of the Algarve's most dazzling churches, this twin-towered baroque masterpiece was completed in 1719 under Jo√£o V. After the 1755 earthquake, its spectacular facade was paid for with Brazilian gold, and the interior is gilded to the extreme, with numerous cherubs. Accessed through the church at the back, the 19th-century Capela dos Ossos is built from the bones and skulls of over 1000 monks as a reminder of earthly impermanence. It's quite a sight.
