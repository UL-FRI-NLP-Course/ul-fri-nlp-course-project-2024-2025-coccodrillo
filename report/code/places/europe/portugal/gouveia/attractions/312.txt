Museu Municipal de Arte Moderna Abel Manta | Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela, Portugal |  This fascinating modern-art museum pays homage to Abel Manta, a (controversial) Portuguese modernist painter, who was born in Gouveia in 1888. Around 23 of his works are on display, along with paintings by other well-known Portuguese artists.
The museum is housed in a 17th-century building, previously home to the Counts of Caria, Vinh√≥ and Almedina, which features fine baroque details (note the doors and windows).
