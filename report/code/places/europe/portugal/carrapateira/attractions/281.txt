Museu do Mar e da Terra da Carrapateira | Carrapateira, Portugal |  The Carrapateira Land & Sea Museum is a must for visitors – surfers or otherwise. Up a steep hill 200m east of the town square, its contemporary design space has small exhibits covering everything from the fishing industry to the daily life of locals, and intriguing photographic collages depicting the Carrapateira of yesteryear (there’s minimal English labelling). The vista from the museum’s viewing window over the dunes is sublime.
