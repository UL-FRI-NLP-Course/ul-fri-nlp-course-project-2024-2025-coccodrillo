Mosteiro de Salzedas | The Douro, Portugal |  With picturesque pink stone arches, the Cistercian Mosteiro de Salzedas is located 3km up the Barosa valley from Ucanha in Salzedas. This was one of the grandest monasteries in the land when it was built in 1168 with funds from Teresa Afonso, governess to Afonso Henriquesâ€™ children. The enormous church, which was extensively remodelled in the 18th century, is today a bit scruffy with decay, particularly its roofless cloisters next door; the faux crystal chandeliers are an odd sight, too.
Across from the church lies the old judiaria (Jewish quarter), with dark narrow lanes skirting around the gloomy centuries-old dwellings.
