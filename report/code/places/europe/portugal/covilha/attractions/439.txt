Ponte Pedonal Penedos Altos | Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela, Portugal |  This striking footbridge spans the valley east of the old town, connecting the centre with the town's outer suburbs. Zigzagging over the valley floor, the 52m-high structure, accessible by a free lift from the Jardim Público, was designed by João Luís Carrilho da Graça and opened to rave architectural reviews in 2009.
