Cascata do Arado | Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês, Portugal |  This gorgeous waterfall is accessed from a bridge over the Rio Arado, just north of the village of Ermida. To see the falls from above, climb to the miradouro (viewpoint) via a signposted, 150m-long staircase from the parking area. Alternatively, boulder-hop your way upriver from the bridge past a series of natural pools to the base of the falls – a prime swimming spot in warm weather.
