Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport | Madeira, Portugal |  Few airports could be counted as true places of interest, but Madeira's runway sticking out on stilts into the Atlantic and hemmed on two sides by mountains definitely can be. From Santa Cruz head uphill along the ER207 that runs high above the runway for great views of planes performing the tricky landing manoeuvre. You can also plane watch from the airport's roof as you wait for your flight.
