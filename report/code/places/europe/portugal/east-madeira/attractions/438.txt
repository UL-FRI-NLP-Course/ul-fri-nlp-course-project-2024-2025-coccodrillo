Praia de Garajau | Madeira, Portugal |  At the foot of the cliff atop which stands the Cristo Rei statue, this stony beach was once used for dismembering and boiling up whales caught by boats off Madeira. It's since been turned into a leisure complex with a restaurant and other facilities, reached by cable car near the statue or a very long and zigzagging road.
