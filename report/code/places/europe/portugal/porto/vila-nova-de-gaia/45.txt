Jardim do Morro | Vila Nova de Gaia, Porto |  The cable car swings up to this hilltop park, which can also be reached by crossing the upper level of Ponte de Dom Lu√≠s I. Shaded by palms, these gardens are all about the view. From here, Porto looks stunning, with the pastel-hued houses of Ribeira on the opposite side of the Douro and the snaking river below.
