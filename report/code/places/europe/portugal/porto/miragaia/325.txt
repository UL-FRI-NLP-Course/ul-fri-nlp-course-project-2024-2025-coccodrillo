Mosteiro de São Bento da Vitória | Miragaia, Porto |  Note the sign in front of this former monastery apologising for the expulsion of the Jews in 1496 under the Portuguese Inquisition and the iron fist of King Manuel I. The monastery was built on former Jewish ground in the 16th century by Benedictine monks. Now classified a National Monument, it harbours a beautiful granite cloister and stages performances by the TNSJ.
