Igreja de Santa Clara | Ribeira, Porto |  Once part of a Franciscan convent, this church hides an opulent interior behind its unassuming facade. Gothic in shape, with a fine Renaissance portal, its baroque interior is dense with elaborately gilded woodwork. At the time of writing, the church was undergoing restoration.
