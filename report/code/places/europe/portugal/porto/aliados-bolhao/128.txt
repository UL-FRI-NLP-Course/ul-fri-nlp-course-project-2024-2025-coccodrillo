Avenida dos Aliados | Aliados & Bolhão, Porto |  Lined with bulging, beaux arts facades and capped by the stately câmara municipal (municipal council), this avenida recalls grand Parisian imitators such as Buenos Aires and Budapest. The avenue's central plaza was restored a few years back and often hosts pop-up book, comic and art festivals and exhibitions.
