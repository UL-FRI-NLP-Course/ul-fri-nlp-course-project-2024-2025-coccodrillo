Mercado do Bolhão | Aliados & Bolhão, Porto |  The 19th-century, wrought-iron Mercado do Bolhão reopened its doors in the fall of 2022 after a major restoration project. The newly renovated market sells fresh produce, meat, fish, flowers, cheese and coffee, and there are even a few restaurants where you can sit down for a bite to eat.
