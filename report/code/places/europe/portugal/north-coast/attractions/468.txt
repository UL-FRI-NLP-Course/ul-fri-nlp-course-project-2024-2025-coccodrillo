Porta da Cruz | Madeira, Portugal |  The furthest point heading eastwards you can reach on the north coast before mammoth cliffs persuade the road to head inland, Porta da Cruz is a picturesque spot nestling at the base of some seriously steep terraced slopes. One of Madeira's last working sugar mills fills the village with a sweet scent.
