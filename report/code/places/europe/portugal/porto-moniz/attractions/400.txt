AquÃ¡rio da Madeira | Madeira, Portugal |  Madeira's top aquarium hides away like a hermit crab in a renovated stone fortress. Inside, 12 tanks represent various ocean habitats around Madeira, the largest contains 500,000L of water and is big enough to accommodate divers. The whole colourful underwater world is here, though most visitors' attention is taken by the sharks in the big tank.
