Museu de Arte Sacra | Albufeira, Portugal |  This tiny museum is housed in the beautifully restored 18th-century Chapel of San Sebastian and exhibits sacred art from surrounding churches that survived the 1755 earthquake. The main draws are the gilded wooden altar and the old azulejos (hand-painted tiles) along the walls.
