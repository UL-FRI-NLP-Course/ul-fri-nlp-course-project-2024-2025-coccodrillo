Praia do Malhão | Vila Nova De Milfontes, Portugal |  If you have your own transport, head 7km north of town to the fantastic Praia do Malhão, backed by rocky dunes and covered in fragrant scrub. The sea can be quite wild here, but the rugged coast is strikingly empty of development. To get here, travel 2.5km to Bruinheras, turn left at the roundabout just before the primary school, then travel another 3km.
