Convento de Santa Clara | Funchal, Portugal |  The highlight of this 15th-century convent, once the island's richest, is one of the island's most attractive churches, with floor to ceiling azulejos tiles and waxy hardwood floors. Knock at the adjacent convent door for a short guided tour of the rest of the complex, given by one of the resident nuns.
