Igreja do Socorro | Funchal, Portugal |  This impressive clifftop church at the eastern end of the Zona Velha is a 1750 rebuild â€“ the original was destroyed in the earthquake of 1748. Slightly off the tourist trail and looking out across the Atlantic in all its baroque pomp, it boasts some impressive azulejos (hand-painted tiles) and a painted ceiling atmospherically dulled by the smoke of a million candles.
