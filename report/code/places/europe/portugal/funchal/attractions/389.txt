Cemitério de São Martinho | Funchal, Portugal |  One of Funchal's largest cemeteries and well off the tourist path, making it all the more fascinating to visit. Funchal's wealthy were once laid to rest here, their coffins stacked in family jazigos – sepulchres resembling small ornate sheds. Art nouveau and functionalist examples are interspersed with neo-Gothic basalt tombs and headstones.
