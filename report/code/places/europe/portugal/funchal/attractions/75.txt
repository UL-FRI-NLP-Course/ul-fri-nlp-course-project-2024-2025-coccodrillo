Pereira D'Oliveira | Funchal, Portugal |  Run by the fifth generation of the D'Oliveira family, this is Funchal's most easily accessible wine experience. Anyone can enter the strongly aromatic barrel room in central Funchal and try almost as much wine as they please, usually accompanied by a wedge of bolo de mel (molasses cake) and crackers. Bottles of wine dating back to the early 20th century line the walls and the company offers good shipping deals on wine you buy.
