Universo de Memórias João Carlos Abreu | Funchal, Portugal |  Housed in an elegant 19th-century mansion, this museum–arts centre is another repository of knick-knacks donated to the city by an avid collector, this time João Carlos Abreu – journalist, writer, politician, actor, artist, former minister of tourism and, evidently, keen traveller and souvenir acquirer. However, these are no ordinary mementos – room after room is packed with wonderful objects, many works of art.
