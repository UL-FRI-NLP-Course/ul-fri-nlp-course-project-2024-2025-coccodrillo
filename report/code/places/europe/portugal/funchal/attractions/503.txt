Igreja do Colégio | Funchal, Portugal |  Funchal's Jesuit Church dominates the city's prettiest square, Praça do Município. No surface is left unadorned in the baroque interior with its azulejos, painted arches and trompe l'oeil ceiling. The tower can be climbed, though there are better vantage points in the city.
