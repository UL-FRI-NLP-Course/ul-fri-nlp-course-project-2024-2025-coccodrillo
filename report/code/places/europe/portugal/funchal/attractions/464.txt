Igreja de São Martinho | Funchal, Portugal |  High above west Funchal rises the highly visable, whitewashed spire of the Igreja de São Martinho, a big early-20th-century creation. The interior is highly decorative and neoclassical in design and the grounds have great views over the west end of the Hotel Zone. Bus 4 climbs up here from the city centre.
