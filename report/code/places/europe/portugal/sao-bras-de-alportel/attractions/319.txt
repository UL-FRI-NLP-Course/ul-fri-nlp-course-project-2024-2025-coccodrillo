Calçadinha de São Brás de Alportel | The Algarve, Portugal |  Constructed during Roman times, this ancient road is thought to have linked Faro (Ossonoba) with Beja (Pax Julia). It was used by mules and shepherds until the 19th century. You can wander along two branches – one is 100m long, the other 500m. Contextual information is available at the interpretive centre Centro da Calçadinha, which can provide free guided tours on request.
