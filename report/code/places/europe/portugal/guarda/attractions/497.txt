Torre dos Ferreiros | The Beiras, Portugal |  A local landmark, this robust rectangular tower is one of the most visible features of the town's medieval defences. It was originally built to protect a gateway known as the Porta dos Ferreiros. It's closed to the public but you can get a pretty good view of it from the street.
