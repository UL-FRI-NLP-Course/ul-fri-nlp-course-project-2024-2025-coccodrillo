Ribeiro Frio | Madeira, Portugal |  'Cold River' village, deep in the mountains but under the tree line, is the chilly jumping off point for some levada walks and has a couple of cosy restaurants serving local trout and heated with log fires. Makes for an interesting stop between Funchal and Santana.
