Bica da Cana | Madeira, Portugal |  High above the central valley at the eastern end of the Pa√∫l da Serra plateau is a place called Bica da Cana. Apart from serving as a picnic spot for cross-island travellers, it also offers widescreen views of Madeira's highest peaks across the valley. It's well known for its wind farm, a controversial addition to this highly visible location.
