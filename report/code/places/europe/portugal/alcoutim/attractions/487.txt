Praia Fluvial | The Algarve, Portugal |  The main attraction for most day trippers is this sandy riverside beach on a narrow tributary of the Rio Guadiana, equipped with a cafe, palm-leaf umbrellas and a lifeguard in summer. The setting is lovely. From the bridge on Rua Dom Fernando, follow the signs 400m west to Praia Fluvial.
