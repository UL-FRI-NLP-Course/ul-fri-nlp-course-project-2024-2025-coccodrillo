Henriques & Henriques | Madeira, Portugal |  Widely regarded by those in the know as the island's best wine producer, Henriques & Henriques only uses grapes from its own vineyards in Quinta Grande and CÃ¢mara de Lobos. The wine is finished off in huge barrels at its modern, specially designed headquarters. Visitors can try the four types of three-year-old wine for free. Anything older normally incurs a charge.
