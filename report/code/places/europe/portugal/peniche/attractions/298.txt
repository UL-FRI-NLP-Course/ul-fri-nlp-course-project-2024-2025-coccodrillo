Museu da Renda de Bilros | Peniche, Portugal |  For those interested in the Peniche tradition of bobbin lace, this museum, inaugurated in 2016, offers an interesting glimpse into this traditional coastal lace textile technique with a short introductory film (four minutes) and small but well-done exhibitions on its history, production, bobbins from around the world and modern adaptations. Stop here first before heading over to see the work in action at the Escola de Rendas de Bilros.
