Nucleo Museológico de Campo do Gerês | Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês, Portugal |  At the main crossroads 1.5km south of Campo do Gerês village, this museum has exhibits on local flora and fauna – but its highlight is the section narrating the history of Vilarinho das Furnas, a neighbouring village that met its demise with the building of a dam just upstream in 1972. In anticipation of the town’s submersion, villagers collected stories and objects to document their former way of life, including their age-old, well-organised system of shared property and decision-making.
All exhibit descriptions are in Portuguese.
