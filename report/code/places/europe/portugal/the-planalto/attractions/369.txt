Penedono | The Beiras, Portugal |  The main draw of this sleepy little village is Penedono's small but splendid castle. Towering over the main street in the upper village, this crenellated keep probably dates to the 14th century and commands fine views over the Planalto.Penedono holds an impressive Medieval Fair at the beginning of each July (dates vary).
