Sernancelhe | The Beiras, Portugal |  Sernancelhe, a tranquil village 30km northwest of Trancoso, boasts a pristine historic centre fashioned out of warm, beige-coloured stone. There are no outstanding sights as such but its 12th-century Igreja de São Jão Baptista sports a handsome facade and you'll find several grand 17th- and 18th-century townhouses, including the elegant Solar dos Cavalhos. All around, verdant hills bloom with what are considered to be Portugal’s best chestnuts.
