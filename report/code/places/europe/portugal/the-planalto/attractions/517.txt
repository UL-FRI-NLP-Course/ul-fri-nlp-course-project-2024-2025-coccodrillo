Castelo de Penedono | The Beiras, Portugal |  Penedono's 14th-century castle, effectively an irregular hexagonal keep crowned by a fairytale crenellation, commands fine views over the Planalto. You can climb to the top, but you'll need a head for heights given the hefty drops and lack of protective barriers.
