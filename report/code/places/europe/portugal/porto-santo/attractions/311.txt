Casa Museu Colombo | Madeira, Portugal |  The Casa Museu Colombo, just off Largo do Pelhourinho in Vila Baleira, was once, it is claimed, the home of Christopher Columbus in the late 1470s. Columbus married the daughter of the first governor of Porto Santo and operated as a sugar merchant there. Whether Columbus really lived in this actual house is unknown, but the exhibitions on the explorer and colonisation of the New World are worth half an hour of your time.
