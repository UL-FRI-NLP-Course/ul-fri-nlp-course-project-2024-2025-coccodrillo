Grutas e Centro do Vulcanismo | Madeira, Portugal |  Top billing on Madeira's north coast goes to this two-for-one attraction just south of São Vicente. The first part of the experience is a guided tour of the local caves – 900,000-year-old lava tubes studied by English geologist James Johnson in the 1850s. The second part is the Centro do Vulcanismo – a 3D, interactive look at Madeira's volcanic birth and volcanoes in general. It's a real hit with the kids and a great wet-weather activity.
