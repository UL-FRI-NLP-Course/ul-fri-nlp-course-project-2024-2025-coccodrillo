Bachalpsee | Bernese Oberland, Switzerland |  Utterly entrancing in the still of early morning, with its perfect reflection of the white pyramid of Schreckhorn (4078m), this glacial lake is less than an hour's walk from the First cable-car top station, through high meadows brushed with wildflowers and chiming with cowbells.
