Schloss Laufen am Rheinfall | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  Looking proudly back on 1000 years of history, the medieval Schloss Laufen offers a close-quarters view of the Rheinfall cascade. You can buy a ticket at its souvenir shop to walk or take the panoramic lift down to the KÃ¤nzeli viewing platform, where you can appreciate the full-on crash-bang spectacle of the falls.
