Old Town | Locarno, Switzerland |  You can feel just how close you are to Italy when exploring Locarno's hilly Citt√† Vecchia (Old Town), an appealing jumble of piazzas, arcades, churches and tall, shuttered Lombard houses in ice-cream colours. At its centre sits the Piazza Grande, with narrow lanes threading off in all directions, while the Castello Visconteo guards its southwestern fringes.
