Museo d'Arte della Svizzera Italiana | Lugano, Switzerland |  The showpiece of Lugano's striking new LAC cultural centre, the MASI zooms in predominantly on 20th-century and contemporary art – from the abstract to the highly experimental, with exhibitions spread across three spaces. There is no permanent collection currently on display, but there is a high-calibre roster of rotating exhibitions. Recent focuses have included European pop art and the work of Belgian surrealist René Magritte.
