Schokoland | Lugano, Switzerland |  Chomp into some cocoa culture at the Alprose chocolate museum, Schokoland â€“ a sure-fire hit with kids. Whiz through chocolate history, watch the sugary substance being made and enjoy a free tasting. The shop, cunningly, stays open half an hour longer. Take the train to Caslano (Sfr6.60, 26 minutes).
