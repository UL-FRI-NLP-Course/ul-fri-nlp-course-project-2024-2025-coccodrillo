Cevio | Ticino, Switzerland |  The centrepiece of Cevio is its vibrant 16th-century Pretorio (magistrate’s court), covered in the family coats-of-arms of many of the area’s rulers, mostly from the 17th century. About 1km away, the heart of the Old Town is graced with 16th-century mansions. A short walk away (signposted) are grotti, cellars carved out of great blocks of granite that tumbled onto the town here in a landslide.
