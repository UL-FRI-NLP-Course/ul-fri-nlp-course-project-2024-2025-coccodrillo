Val Bavona | Ticino, Switzerland |  A smooth road follows a mountain stream through this valley, where narrow meadows are cradled between steep rocky walls. Its tightly huddled stone and slate-roofed hamlets are irresistible. The impossibly pretty grey-stone hamlet of Foroglio is dominated by the wispy spray of its 100m waterfall.
The last village in the valley is San Carlo, where a cable car swings up to Robiei Dam and its vivid aqua-blue reservoir. It's terrific hiking terrain up here.
