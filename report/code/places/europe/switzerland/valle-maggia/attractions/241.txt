Bosco Gurin | Ticino, Switzerland |  A road of seemingly endless hairpin bends snakes up to this minor ski centre (with 30km of pistes) and high-pasture village of slate-roofed, whitewashed houses. It is the only village in Ticino where the main language is German, a result of Valais immigrants. This heritage is spelled out in artefacts at the stone-and-wood Walserhaus.
