Abbatiale de Payerne | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  The five-apse Romanesque Abbatiale de Payerne has been at the heart of religion and culture in the region since the 11th century, and frequently hosts exhibitions and concerts beneath its fine frescoes and broad sandstone arches. At the time of writing, the abbey was undergoing extensive structural renovations and access was limited. It is expected to re-open fully in 2018.
