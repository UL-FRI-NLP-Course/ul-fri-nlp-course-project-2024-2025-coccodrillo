Vissoie | Valais, Switzerland |  Medieval Vissoie, at 1200m and with a population of about 500, has been inhabited since the 13th century and acts as the main village and a crossroads for the valley. Roads head up the valley sides to the west and east as well as deeper into the valley. The village is a 13km-drive south of Sierre, an exciting mission on a winding road, whether you be in a PostBus or a car.
