Kunstmuseum Appenzell | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  In a town as deeply traditional as Appenzell, this startlingly modern gallery, with its metallic facade and zigzag design, comes as quite a surprise. Architects Gigon & Guyer created it to house the town's small collection of contemporary art, which focuses predominantly on the works of local artist Carl August Liner and his son Carl Walter.
