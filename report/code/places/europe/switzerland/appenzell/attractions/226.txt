Pfarrkirche St Mauritius | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  Looking back on almost 1000 years of history, Appenzellâ€™s church is easily identified by its whopping great late-Gothic bell tower, embellished with a mural of the cantonal patron saint, St Maurice. If the facade is somewhat austere, the interior is the polar opposite, replete with frescoes, stained glass and gilding. The church is a potpourri of Gothic, baroque and neoclassical styles.
