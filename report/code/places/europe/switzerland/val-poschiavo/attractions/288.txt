Lago di Poschiavo | Graub√ºnden, Switzerland |  At 962m, a few kilometres down the valley from the village of Poschiavo, this gorgeous lake was formed naturally by rock slides on both sides of the valley meeting and forming a natural dam. The lake has its own train station, Miralago, at its southern end. Hop off the train and hike around the lake in an hour or so.
