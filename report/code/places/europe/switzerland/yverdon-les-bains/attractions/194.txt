Abbatiale de Romainmôtier | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  About 23km southwest of Yverdon-les-Bains, the little village of Romainmôtier is wholly dominated by the Cluny order’s abbey, a remarkable sandstone church whose origins reach back to the 6th century. Upon and around its 11th-century Romanesque core, new layers were added in higgledy-piggledy fashion over the ensuing centuries. It's frequently the setting for concerts and recitals.
