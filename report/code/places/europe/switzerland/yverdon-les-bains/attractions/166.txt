Château de Grandson | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  This imposing fortress lies 5km along the lakefront from Yverdon. Its thick stone walls hide a smattering of small museums – the history museum evokes the fate of Charles the Bold who, in early 1476 in his battle against Swiss Confederate troops, found some of his routed Burgundian troops strung from apple trees in the castle orchard. Regular buses connect Yverdon with Grandson (Sfr3.50, 15 minutes).
