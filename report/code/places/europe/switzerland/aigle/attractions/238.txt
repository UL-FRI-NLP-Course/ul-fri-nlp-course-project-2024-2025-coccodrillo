Maison de la Dîme | Lake Geneva & Vaud, Switzerland |  Within the grounds of Château d'Aigle, across the street from the castle gate, you'll find the 13th-century Maison de la Dîme: take peek at whatever temporary exhibition with a viticultural bent is on upstairs. Entry is included with your admission to the castle and Musée de la Vigne et du Vin.
