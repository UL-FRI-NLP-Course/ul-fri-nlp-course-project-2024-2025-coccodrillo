Museum Jean Tinguely | Basel, Switzerland |  Designed by leading Ticino architect Mario Botta, this museum showcases the playful, mischievous and downright wacky artistic concoctions of sculptor-turned-mad-scientist Jean Tinguely. Buttons next to some of Tinguely's ‘kinetic’ sculptures allow visitors to set them in motion. It's great fun to watch them rattle, shake and twirl, with springs, feathers and wheels radiating at every angle, or to hear the haunting musical sounds produced by the gigantic Méta-Harmonies on the upper floor. Catch bus 31 or 36 from Claraplatz.
