Münster | Basel, Switzerland |  Blending Gothic exteriors with Romanesque interiors, this 13th-century cathedral was largely rebuilt after an earthquake in 1356. Renaissance humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466–1536), who lived in Basel, lies buried in the northern aisle. Groups of two or more can climb the soaring Gothic towers (Sfr5 per person). Behind the church, leafy Münster Pfalz offers sublime Rhine views.
