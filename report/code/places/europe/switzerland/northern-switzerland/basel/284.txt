Rathaus | Basel, Switzerland |  One of Basel's most entrancing landmarks, the 16th-century Rathaus takes pride of place on Marktplatz. Its ornate red sandstone facade is smothered in whimsical trompe l'Å“il frescos of frolicking cherubs, deities and nobility. You can visit the inner courtyard for a closer look. It is now the seat of local government.
