Schloss Spiez | Bernese Oberland, Switzerland |  This turreted medieval castle is smothered in oil paintings of its former masters, the influential von Bubenburg and von Erlach families. But itâ€™s the view that will grab you, whether from the lofty tower (which also sports 13th-century graffiti) or the banqueting hall.
