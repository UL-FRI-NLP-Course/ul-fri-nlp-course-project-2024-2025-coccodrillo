Museum of Wax Moulages | Zürich, Switzerland |  Moulages are 3D, naturalistic recreations of body parts and the skin alterations that various diseases can evoke. They were used in the 19th century to study diseases, and have themselves now become a subject of scholarly interest. Zürich hosts the most life-like and well-preserved wax moulages but you’ll need a strong stomach for this academic house of horrors.
