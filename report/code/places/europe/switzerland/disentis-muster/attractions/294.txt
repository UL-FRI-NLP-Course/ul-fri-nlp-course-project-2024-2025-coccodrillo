Kloster Disentis | Graubünden, Switzerland |  This Benedictine monastery, which towers above Disentis/Mustér, has a lavishly stuccoed baroque church attached. A monastery has stood here since the 8th century, but the present immense complex dates from the 18th century. The Klostermuseum is crammed with memorabilia on the monastery's history.
