Bundesbriefmuseum | Central Switzerland, Switzerland |  This museum is worth a visit just to eyeball the original 1291 charter of federation signed by Nidwalden, Schwyz and Uri cantons. It’s accompanied by some academic bickering in German and French about its authenticity, as many historians question the accuracy of Switzerland’s founding ‘myths’. Pick up an English booklet at the front desk.
