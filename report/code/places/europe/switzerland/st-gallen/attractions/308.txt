St Laurenzen-Kirche | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  St Gallen’s cathedral gets all the attention, but this Protestant neo-Gothic church is also beautiful, with its mosaic-tiled roof, delicate floral frescos and star-studded ceiling resembling a night sky. Climb the tower for views over the town’s terracotta rooftops and spires.
