Furka Pass | Valais, Switzerland |  Marking the cantonal frontier with Uri is the vertiginous Furka Pass (2431m), the run up to which offers superlative views over the fissured Rh√¥ne glacier. From the tiny Valais village of Gletsch (1762m) the road climbs almost continuously for 10km to the pass. Generally opening about 1 June each year (depending on snowfall and weather conditions), the Furka Pass is the gateway into southeast Switzerland. From the pass it's 21km jaw-dropping drive down countless hairpin curves to Andermatt (1437m).
