Einstein-Haus Bern | Bern, Switzerland |  Housed in the humble apartment that Einstein shared with his young family while working at the Bern patent office, this small museum includes a 20-minute biographical film telling Einstein's life story. Displays trace the development of Einstein’s general equation E=mc² and the sometimes poignant trajectory of his family life.
