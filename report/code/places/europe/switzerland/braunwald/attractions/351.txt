Oberblegisee | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  Formed by glacial moraine, this vivid blue lake is reached via a beautiful mountain trail from Braunwald. The moderate, 3Â½-hour walk leads through meadows and open forest and takes in an Alpine dairy. The lake is a great spot for a family picnic.
