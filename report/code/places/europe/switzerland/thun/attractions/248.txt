Thun Panorama | Bernese Oberland, Switzerland |  Swiss artist Marquard Wocher sketched out this panoramic painting – the world's oldest cyclorama of its kind – between 1809 and 1814, seizing inspiration from the view as seen from a rooftop in Thun's historic centre. Measuring 7.5m high and 38m long, the picture depicts the buzz of the town in the early morning, set against the backdrop of lake and mountains.
