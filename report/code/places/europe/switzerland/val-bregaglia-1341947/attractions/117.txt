Soglio | Graub√ºnden, Switzerland |  Soglio (1090m), a hamlet of 300 near the Italian border, faces the smooth-sided Pizzo Badile (3308m). Segantini claimed it was 'the gateway to paradise' and the narrow cobblestone streets are full of history, first mentioned as a town in documents from 1219. There are great hiking trails, most notably the historic La Panoramica route, which passes through on its way down the valley.
