Ar√®nes d'Avenches | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  The 1st-century Roman amphitheatre is as impressive as it is unexpected to find in a small Swiss village. Used throughout the year for occasional outdoor concerts such as the Avenches Opera Festival, thie theater in the round seats up to 5000 spectators. At any other time, you're blissfully free to wander around the partially restored site as you please.
