Gemmibahn | Valais, Switzerland |  This cable car whisks walkers up to the Gemmi Pass (2322m), clearly visible high above town, in next to no time. From the top, Lake Dauben and the surrounding valley is a fantastic area for hiking, riddled with well-marked trails; grab a map from the tourist office before striding out from the top station. At the top of the cable car, ogle the incredible panorama at your feet from the steely panoramic platform.
