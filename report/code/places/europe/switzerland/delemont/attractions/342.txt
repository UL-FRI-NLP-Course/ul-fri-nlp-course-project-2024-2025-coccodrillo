Chapelle du Vorbourg | The Jura Mountains, Switzerland |  About 3km outside town is this dramatically located chapel, clinging to a ledge above the Birse, a tributary of the Rhine. It was first built in the 11th century, but was destroyed by earthquake in 1356. Since then it's been damaged and rebuilt several times.
