Château de Delémont | The Jura Mountains, Switzerland |  A Swiss Heritage site of national significance, Delémont's former castle, in the centre of town, today houses a primary school. Built in baroque style, it was completed in 1721. If you want to peer around the grounds, feel free to pop your head in and nicely ask one of the administration staff if you can take a look; otherwise, appreciate the building from the outside.
