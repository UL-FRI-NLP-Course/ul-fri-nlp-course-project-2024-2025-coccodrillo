Ligerz Wine Museum | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  Learn about the wines of the Bielersee region on a guided tour of this small museum and the delightful 16th-century noble's home in which it is housed. A minimum of ten people are required for the tour to proceed, so be sure to phone in advance to make a reservation. Some French or German language ability is helpful but not essential. Tastings are available, but this should be considered more of a museum tour than a cellar door.
