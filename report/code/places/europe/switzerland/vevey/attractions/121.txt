Musée Suisse du Jeu | Vevey, Switzerland |  An amusing spot for kids, the Swiss Game Museum has games arranged by theme – educational, strategic, simulation, skill and chance – and there are several you can play, including outdoor ones in the elegant waterfront grounds. The museum is in a château on the lakeshore, a 1.6km walk east of Vevey station along lakeside Quai Perdonnet.
