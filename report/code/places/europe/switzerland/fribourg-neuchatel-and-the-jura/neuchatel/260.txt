Église Collégiale | Neuchâtel, Switzerland |  The interior of the largely Gothic Église Collégiale is a mix of Romanesque elements (notably the triple apse). Facing the main entrance is a statue of Guillaume Farel, who brought the Reformation to town, after which the cathedral was obliged to swap sides. Behind the church is 15th-century Château de Neuchâtel, a castle with a pretty courtyard.
