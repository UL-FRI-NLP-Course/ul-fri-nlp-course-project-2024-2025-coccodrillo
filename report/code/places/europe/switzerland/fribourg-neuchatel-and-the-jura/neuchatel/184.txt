Old Town | Neuchâtel, Switzerland |  The Old Town streets are peppered with 18th-century mansions and decorative fountains. Heading uphill along Rue du Château, walk through the medieval city gate to the Prison Tower. Scale the tower for views over the town below and its lake and Alpine backdrop. Inside the largely Gothic Église Collégiale, a mix of Romanesque elements (notably the triple apse) looms large.
