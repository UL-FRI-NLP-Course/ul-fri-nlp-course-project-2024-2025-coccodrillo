Fontaine de la Justice | Neuchâtel, Switzerland |  One of two fanciful fountains featuring gold-leaf galore that can be found in Neuchâtel's Old Town (the other is the Fontaine du Banneret). It features a decorative column topped by a woman representing Justice; see a copy on the street and the original in the Musée d’Art et d’Histoire.
