Old Town | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  The 12th-century Old Town was laid out in simple fashion, with Grand-Rue as the main street and parallel Rue des Chanoines and Rue des Bouchers devoted to markets, church and civic buildings. The settlement later spread downhill to the river: the bridges here – stone Pont du Milieu (Middle Bridge; 1720) and covered Pont du Berne (1250) – offer great views.
