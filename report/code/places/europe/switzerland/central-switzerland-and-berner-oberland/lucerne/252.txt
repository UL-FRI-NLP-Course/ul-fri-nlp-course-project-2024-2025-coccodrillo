Zytturm | Lucerne, Switzerland |  Near the western end of the old city walls' walkway, you both ascend or descend here at Zytturm, with its legendary clock. Since the late Middle Ages the Zytturm Clock, held up by two giants, has had the right to chime first, one minute before all other public clocks in Lucerne. There are nine more historic clocks inside the tower that can be viewed for free.
