Inseli | Lucerne, Switzerland |  Just a stone’s throw from the train station, Inseli is a leafy lakefront park where locals congregate in sunny weather to lounge on the grass, play ping-pong at outdoor tables and drink at the summertime bars Volière and Buvette. From the station, head east past the Kultur und Kongresszentrum (KKL), then turn 100m south along the lakeshore.
