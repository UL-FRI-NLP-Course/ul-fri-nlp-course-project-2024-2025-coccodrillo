Grand St Bernard Museum | Valais, Switzerland |  The exhibition at this museum, in the same building as the Auberge de lâ€™Hospice on the Col du Grand St Bernard, tells the complete story of this remote mountain pass, inaccessible by vehicle for half the year. Open in summer, tickets are valid for both the museum and dog kennels, with plenty of St Bernard dogs to see.
