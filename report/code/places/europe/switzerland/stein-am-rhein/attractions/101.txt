Rathausplatz | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  Often hailed as Switzerlandâ€™s most beautiful town square (no mean feat!), the elongated Rathausplatz in Stein am Rhein often elicits little gasps of wonder because it's so darned ornate. The fresco-festooned Rathaus (town hall) soars above the 16th-century houses named after their elaborate murals, such as Sonne (Sun) and Der Weisse Adler (The White Eagle). Look up a level and you'll notice that many also sport intricately carved oriel windows and billowing flower boxes. It's pure fairy-tale stuff.
