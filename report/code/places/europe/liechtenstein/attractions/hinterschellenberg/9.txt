Hinterschellenberg | Liechtenstein, Europe |  Hinterschellenberg briefly entered the stream of world history when about 500 Russian soldiers who had fought on the German side in WWII crossed the border in search of asylum in 1945. They remained for about 2Â½ years, after which most made for Argentina. A memorial about 100m from the Austrian border marks the event. Take bus 11 from Vaduz to Mauren and then bus 33.
