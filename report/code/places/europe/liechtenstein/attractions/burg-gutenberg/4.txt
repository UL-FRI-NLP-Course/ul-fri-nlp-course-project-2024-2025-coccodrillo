Burg Gutenberg | Liechtenstein, Europe |  Balzersâ€™ most visible icon is this state-owned, hilltop 13th-century castle, open only for concerts. Restored in the 20th century, the castle cuts a striking figure on the horizon and boasts nice strolls in the vicinity. The area was settled as early as the Neolithic period and Roman elements have been found in its foundations. Buses 11 and 13 run from Vaduz to Balzers.
