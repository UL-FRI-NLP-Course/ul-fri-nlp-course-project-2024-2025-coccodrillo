Spielzeugmuseum | Salzburg, Austria |  On the arcaded Bürgerspitalplatz, the Spielzeugmuseum takes a nostalgic look at toys, with its collection of dolls' houses and Steiff teddies. There’s also dress-up fun, marble games and a little builder’s dream of a Bosch workshop. Parents can hang out in the ‘adult parking areas’ and at the free tea bar while the little ones let off excess energy.
