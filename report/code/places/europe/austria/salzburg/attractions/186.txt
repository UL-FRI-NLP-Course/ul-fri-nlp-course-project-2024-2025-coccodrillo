Residenzplatz | Salzburg, Austria |  With its horse-drawn carriages, palace and street entertainers, this stately baroque square is the Salzburg of a thousand postcards. Its centrepiece is the Residenzbrunnen, an enormous marble fountain. The plaza is the late 16th-century vision of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich, who, inspired by Rome, enlisted Italian architect Vincenzo Scamozzi to design it.
