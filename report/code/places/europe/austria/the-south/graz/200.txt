Franziskaner Kirche | Graz, Austria |  This church and monastery was founded by the Franciscan order in 1239. Its 14th-century chancel was rebuilt in a contemporary style after being gutted by an Allied bomb during WWII. The main reason to visit, however, is the serene, silent, rose-filled monastery garden, still surrounded by its original Gothic cloisters.
The monks welcome visitors to join them for vespers.
