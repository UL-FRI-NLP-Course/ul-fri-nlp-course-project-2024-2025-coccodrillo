FRida & FreD | Graz, Austria |  This small but fun-packed Â­museum is aimed at kids aged three to 12, and hosts two exhibitions, one for children from three to seven years, and a second for children from eight years and older. Both have changing exhibitions that educationally and interactively focus on a particular theme, which changes each year in spring. It also has some great workshops and theatre.
