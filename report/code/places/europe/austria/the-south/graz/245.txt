Murinsel | Graz, Austria |  Murinsel is a constructed island-cum-bridge of metal and plastic in the middle of the Mur. This modern floating landmark contains a cafe, a kids' playground and a small stage. Even if you don't stop in, it's a great little detour that brings you up close to the fast-flowing river.
