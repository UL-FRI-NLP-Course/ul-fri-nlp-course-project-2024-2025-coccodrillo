Museum der Wahrnehmung | Graz, Austria |  Exploring sensory illusions, the Museum of Perception features a small changing exhibition of art works that have a close (or sometimes distant) relationship to perception, as well as gadgets that help you explore illusion for yourself. The samadhi, or meditative bath, is a therapeutic bath that deprives the body of all sensory input (book at least a week ahead; 16-year-olds and over only). Ask for the English information sheet.
