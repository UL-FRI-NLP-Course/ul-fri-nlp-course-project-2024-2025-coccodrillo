Stadtpfarrkirche | Graz, Austria |  Rising up on Herrengasse between the main square and Jakominiplatz, the town parish church stands out for its attractive baroque exterior. Inside, the post-WWII stained-glass window by Salzburg artist Albert Birkle has a controversial anomaly: the fourth panel from the bottom on the right (left of the high altar) clearly shows Hitler and Mussolini looking on as Christ is scourged.
