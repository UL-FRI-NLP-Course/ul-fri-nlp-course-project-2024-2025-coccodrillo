Eboard Museum | Klagenfurt, Austria |  With the largest collection of keyboard instruments in Europe (more than 1300), this quirky museum is literally a ‘fingers-on’ experience: you are able to play most of the organs, including rare items such as a Model A Hammond from 1934. Live bands perform on Friday nights (except in July and August) at 8pm (cover charge €5 to €10).
