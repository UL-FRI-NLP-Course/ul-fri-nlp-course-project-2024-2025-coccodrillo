Dom | Klagenfurt, Austria |  Klagenfurt's single-nave cathedral doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it has an ornate marble pulpit and sugary pink-and-white stucco covering every other surface. The artistic highlight is an altar painting in the chapel by Paul Troger dedicated to St Ignatius. It's on the right as you look towards the altar.
