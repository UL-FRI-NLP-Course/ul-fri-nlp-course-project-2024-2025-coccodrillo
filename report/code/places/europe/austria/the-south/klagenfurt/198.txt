KÃ¤rntner Botanikzentrum | Klagenfurt, Austria |  This small botanical garden is especially popular for its evocative landscape of small cliffs with alpine plants, and for another section with a waterfall and ponds. Adjoining it is the Kreuzberglkirche, perched on a hillock with some pretty mosaics of the Stations of the Cross on the path leading up to it. Take bus 60 or 61 from Heiligengeistplatz to Kreuzbergl.
