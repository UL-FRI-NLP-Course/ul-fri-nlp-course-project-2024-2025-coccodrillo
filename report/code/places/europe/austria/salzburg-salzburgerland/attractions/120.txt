Burg Mauterndorf | Salzburg & Salzburgerland, Austria |  Looking every inch the fairy-tale castle with its setting atop a rocky outcrop and sturdy towers, medieval Burg Mauterndorf is its village's pride and joy. It was built in the 13th century by the archbishops of Salzburg on the site of a Roman fort. The castle now houses a regional museum and provides the backdrop for various cultural events. Mauterndorf is on Hwy 99; buses run here several times daily from Radstadt (â‚¬9, 48 minutes).
It is believed that in the Middle Ages the main road passed directly through the castle courtyard and tolls were extracted from road users.
