Lehár Villa | The Salzkammergut, Austria |  This pink villa was the home of opera composer Franz Lehár and is a picture of late-Imperial-era Austria in all its stuffy glory. Left exactly as Lehár left it, it's filled with period furniture, personal ephemera and a painting collection. It can only be visited on a tour – organise these at the Stadtmuseum. You can also buy a combined ticket (adult/child €9.50/€5.40).
