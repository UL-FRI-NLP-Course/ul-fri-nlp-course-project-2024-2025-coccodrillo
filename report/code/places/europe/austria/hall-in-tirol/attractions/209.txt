Pfarrkirche St Nikolaus | Tyrol, Austria |  This graceful 13th-century church is best known for its Waldaufkapelle, home to Florian Waldaufâ€™s grisly collection of 45 skulls and 12 bones, picked from the remains of minor saints. Each rests on embroidered cushions, capped with veils and elaborate headdresses, reminiscent of spiked haloes; the whole effect is both repulsive and enthralling.
