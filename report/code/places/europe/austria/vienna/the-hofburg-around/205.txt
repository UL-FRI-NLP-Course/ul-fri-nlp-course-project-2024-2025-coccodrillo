Schmetterlinghaus | Vienna, Austria |  Sharing the Habsburgâ€™s personal Jugendstil glasshouse (1901) with the Palmenhaus bar in the Burggarten, the Schmetterlinghaus has hundreds of fluttering butterflies and a shop stocking a great range of butterfly paraphernalia. Its warm, humid air is especially welcome on chilly days.
