Michaelerkirche | Vienna, Austria |  The Michaelerkirche dates from the 13th century. Its highlight is the burial crypt which you can see on 40-minute bilingual German/English tours at 11am and 1pm Monday to Saturday. Tours take you past coffins, some revealing occupants preserved by the rarefied air of the crypt. Concerts take place throughout the year; check the website for the program.
