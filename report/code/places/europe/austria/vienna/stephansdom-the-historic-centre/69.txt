Holocaust-Denkmal | Vienna, Austria |  Deliberately reminiscent of a bunker, the steel-and-concrete Holocaust-Denkmal (2000) is a memorial to the 65,000 Austrian Jews who perished in the Holocaust. Designed by British sculptor Rachel Whiteread, this ‘nameless library’ depicts books with their spines facing inwards, representing the lost knowledge of the Holocaust victims. It's inscribed with the names of Austrian concentration camps where the victims were murdered.
