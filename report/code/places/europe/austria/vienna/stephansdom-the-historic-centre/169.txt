Cathedral Pummerin | Vienna, Austria |  Weighing 21 tonnes, the Pummerin is Austria's largest bell and was installed in the north tower of Stephansdom in 1957. While the rest of the cathedral was rising up in its new Gothic format, work was interrupted on this tower due to a lack of cash and the fading allure of Gothic architecture. It's accessible by lift (elevator); you don't need a tour ticket for the main nave.
