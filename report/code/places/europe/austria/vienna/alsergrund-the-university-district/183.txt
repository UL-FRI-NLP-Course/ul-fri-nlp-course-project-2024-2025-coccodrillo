Museum für Volkskunde | Vienna, Austria |  Housed in turn-of-the-18th-century Palais Schönborn, this folklore museum gives a taste of 18th- and 19th-century rural dwellings, and is stocked with handcrafted sculptures, paintings and furniture from throughout Austria and its neighbouring countries. Many of the pieces have a religious or rural theme, and telltale floral motifs are everywhere. Temporary exhibitions are regularly featured.
