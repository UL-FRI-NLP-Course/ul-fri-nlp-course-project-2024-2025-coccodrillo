Brotfabrik | Vienna, Austria |  Located in the gritty 10th district, this former bread factory from the 1890s has been transformed into a warren of contemporary art galleries and photographic exhibition halls. Hours and admission prices vary depending on the exhibitions; check the agenda online. Magdas, a social enterprise cafe in the lower courtyard, is staffed by refugees and the long-term unemployed.
