Haydnhaus | Vienna, Austria |  Joseph Haydn (1732–1809) lived in Vienna during the heady times of Napoleon’s occupation, and this exhibition at his last residence focuses on Vienna as well as London during the late-18th and early-19th centuries. An Austrian composer prominent in the classical period, he is most celebrated for his 104 symphonies and 68 string quartets. The small garden here is modelled on Haydn's. Audio guides cost €4.
