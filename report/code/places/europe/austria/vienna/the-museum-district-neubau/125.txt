Justizpalast | Vienna, Austria |  Completed in 1881, the Justizpalast is home to the supreme court. It’s an impressive neo-Renaissance building that – as long as you’re not being dragged in wearing handcuffs – is also interesting inside. The 23m-high central hall is a majestic ensemble of staircase, arcades, glass roofing and an oversized statue of Justitia poised with her sword and law book. To enter, you pass through airport-style security; bring photo ID.
The cafe on the top floor is open to the general public and has great views across the Hofburg.
