Schloss Landeck | Tyrol, Austria |  Standing sentinel above Landeck, this 13th-century hilltop castle is visible from afar. The 1st-floor museum showcases everything from Celtic figurines to hand-carved Krampus (devil) masks, as well as a wonderful mechanised nativity scene during Advent. Climb the dizzying staircase to the tower for sweeping views over Landeck and the Lechtaler Alps.
