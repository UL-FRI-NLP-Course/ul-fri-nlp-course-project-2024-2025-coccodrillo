Altstadt | Tyrol, Austria |  Schwaz hides a remarkably well-preserved Altstadt, built high on the riches of medieval silver. Taking pride of place on pedestrianised Franz-Josef-Strasse, the Gothic Pfarrkirche immediately catches your eye with its step-gabled roof bearing 14,000 copper tiles. Not far south is the Gothic-meets-baroque Franziskanerkirche.
