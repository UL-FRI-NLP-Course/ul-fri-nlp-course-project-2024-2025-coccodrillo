Kepler Salon | Linz, Austria |  The great astronomer, mathematician and astrologer Johannes Kepler lived here while he completed the groundbreaking Rudolphine Tables. The house now harbours the Kepler Salon, which opens to the public when it hosts science-themed events. The genius is also commemorated by the Planet Fountain at the Landhaus, and by the university named after him, where he taught from 1612 to 1626.
