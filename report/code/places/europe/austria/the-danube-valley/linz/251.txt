Donaupark | Linz, Austria |  Next to Lentos on the southern bank of the Danube is the Donaupark, the cityâ€™s green escape vault. Modern sculptures rise above the bushes in the well-tended gardens, which are a magnet for walkers, joggers, skaters, picnickers and city workers seeking fresh air in summer.
