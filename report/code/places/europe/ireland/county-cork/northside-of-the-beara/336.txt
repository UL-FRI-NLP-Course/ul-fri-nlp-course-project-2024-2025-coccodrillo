Gleninchaquin Park | Beara Peninsula, Ireland |  This working sheep farm offers a whole range of things to do, from waymarked history and geology walks to trout fishing and feeding the lambs (in spring), all in an extraordinarily beautiful setting, high in a valley overlooked by a bridal-veil waterfall. It's signposted off the R571 halfway between Lauragh and Kenmare. Cash only.
