Lewis Glucksman Gallery | Cork City, Ireland |  This award-winning building is a startling construction of limestone, steel and timber, built in 2004 by Dublin architects O'Donnell and Tuomey. Three floors of galleries display the best in both national and international contemporary art and installation. The on-site Bobo cafe is excellent.
