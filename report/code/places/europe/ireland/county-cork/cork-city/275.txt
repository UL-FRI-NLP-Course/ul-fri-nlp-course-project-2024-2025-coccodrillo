Old Butter Market | Cork City, Ireland |  Cork had the largest butter market in the world during the 1860s, exporting butter as far as India, South America and Australia. The Butter Exchange was in Shandon and you can still spot dairy motifs throughout the area: look out for the cow's head above the arched entrance to the Old Butter Market (now closed). The history of the market is covered in the Butter Museum next door.
