Cork Public Museum | Cork City, Ireland |  Located in a Georgian mansion with a modern extension, this museum recounts Corkâ€™s history. The diverse collection of local artefacts tells the story from the Stone Age right up to local football legend Roy Keane, with a particularly interesting exhibit on medieval Cork and the growth of the city. There's a good cafe around the back.
