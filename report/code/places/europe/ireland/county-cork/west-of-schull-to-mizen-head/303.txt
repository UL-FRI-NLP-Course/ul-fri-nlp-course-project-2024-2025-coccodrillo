Barleycove Beach | County Cork, Ireland |  Vast sand dunes hemmed in by two long bluffs dissolve into the surf, forming West Cork's finest beach. Rarely crowded, it's a great place for youngsters, with gorgeous stretches of golden sand and a safe bathing area where a stream flows down to the sea. Access is via a long boardwalk and floating pontoon bridge (open from May to September) from the car park on the road to Crookhaven.
