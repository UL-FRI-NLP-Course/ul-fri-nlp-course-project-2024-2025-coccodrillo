Daniel O'Connell Monument | County Clare, Ireland |  Set on a soaring column, a statue of Daniel O'Connell (aka the 'Great Liberator') presides over the Square.
O'Connell's election to the British parliament by a huge majority in 1828 forced Britain to lift its ban on Catholic MPs and led to the Act of Catholic Emancipation a year later.
