Clare Museum | County Clare, Ireland |  At this diverting little museum, the 'Riches of Clare' exhibition tells the story of Clare from 8000 years ago to the present day using authentic artefacts grouped into five themes: earth (geology, seasons and agriculture), power (such as hill forts and tower houses), faith (Christianity's influence), water (the county's relationship with the River Shannon and the Atlantic) and energy (particularly Clare's musical and sporting prowess).
