Gleninsheen Wedge Tomb | The Burren, Ireland |  One of Ireland's most famous prehistoric grave sites, Gleninsheen lies beside the R480 7km south of Ballyvaughan. It's thought to date from 4000 to 5000 years ago. A magnificent gold gorget (a crescent of beaten gold that hung round the neck) found here and dating from the late Bronze Age is now on display at the National Museum in Dublin.
Note: the access gate to the tomb is sometimes locked, and signage is poor.
