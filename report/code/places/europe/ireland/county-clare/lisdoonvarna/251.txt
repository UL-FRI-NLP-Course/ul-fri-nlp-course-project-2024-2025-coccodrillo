Spa Well | The Burren, Ireland |  At the town's southern end is a spa well, with a sulphur spring, a Victorian pumphouse and a wooded setting. The iron, sulphur, magnesium and iodine in the water are believed to be good for rheumatic and glandular complaints.
Walking trails head off east beside the river to two other well sites. They emerge, handily, near the Roadside Tavern and the Burren Smokehouse.
