Beal Ború | County Clare, Ireland |  The remains of this early-medieval ring fort are believed by some to have been Kincora, the fabled palace of the famous Irish king Brian Ború. His forces defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, although Ború himself was slain in the fight. Traces of Bronze Age settlement have also been discovered here. It's just over 2km north of Killaloe's town centre.
