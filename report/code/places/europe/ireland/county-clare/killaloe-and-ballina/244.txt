Brian Ború Heritage Centre | County Clare, Ireland |  Inside the former lock keeper's cottage on the little islet Between the Waters, the Brian Ború Heritage Centre celebrates the local boy made good as the king who, according to the political spinmeisters of his time, both unified Ireland and freed it from the Vikings. Displays also illustrate the nautical heritage of the surrounding patchwork of lakes and rivers.
The centre is also home to the town's tourist office.
