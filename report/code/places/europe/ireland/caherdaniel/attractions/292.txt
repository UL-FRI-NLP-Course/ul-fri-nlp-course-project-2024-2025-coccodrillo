Derrynane Beach | Ring of Kerry, Ireland |  Derrynane's Blue Flag beach is one of the most beautiful in Kerry, with scalloped coves of golden sand set between grassy dunes and whaleback outcrops of wave-smoothed rock. From the car park at Derrynane House, you can walk 1km along the beach to explore Abbey Island and its picturesque cemetery â€“ look inside the ruined chapel to find the tomb of Daniel O'Connell's wife, Mary.
