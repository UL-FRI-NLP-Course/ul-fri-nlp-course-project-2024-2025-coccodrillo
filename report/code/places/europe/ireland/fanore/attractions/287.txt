Fanore Beach | The Burren, Ireland |  With an extensive backdrop of grass-covered dunes, this Blue Flag–rated beach off the R477 is patrolled by lifeguards in summer and is a surfing hotspot. Its golden sands have exposed limestone outcrops – part of the Burren – at low tide. Signs identify hiking trails along the coast and up into the dramatic hills. You'll find showers and toilets open in summer in a small block by the car park.
