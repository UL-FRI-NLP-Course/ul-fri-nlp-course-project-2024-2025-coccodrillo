Kerry's Most Spectacular Cliffs | Skellig Ring, Ireland |  Its hyperbolic name – and recreated dry-stone clochán with fake birds perched on top – aside, the view is indeed spectacular from this privately owned walk along 305m-high cliffs, which look out over Skellig Michael and surrounding islands. The 800m-long path is fenced and has coin-operated binoculars. Admission includes parking; a cafe opens from Easter to September.
