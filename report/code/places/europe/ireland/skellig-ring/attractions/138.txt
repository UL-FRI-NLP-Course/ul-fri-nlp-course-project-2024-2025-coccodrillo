Ballinskelligs Priory | Skellig Ring, Ireland |  The sea and salty air are eating away at the atmospheric ruins of this medieval priory, a monastic settlement that was probably built by the Skellig Michael monks after they fled their isolated outpost in the 12th century. The ruins are 400m south of the car park for Ballinskelligs Beach.
