Skelligs Chocolate | Skellig Ring, Ireland |  At these gleaming open-plan premises, you can get an overview of chocolate production and taste the wares too. Samples are free, and chocolates are sold in boxes, bags, and in dishes – along with heavenly hot chocolate – at the rather industrial on-site cafe (open Easter to September).
