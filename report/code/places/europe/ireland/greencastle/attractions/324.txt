Northburgh Castle | Inishowen Peninsula, Ireland |  Once known as Northburg Castle and then known as Greencastle, apparently from the stone it was constructed from (but today it very well describes the copious ivy that covers its walls), this imposing but badly crumbling edifice is east of town. The views out over to the beach at Magilligan Point in Londonderry on the far side of Lough Foyle are supreme.
