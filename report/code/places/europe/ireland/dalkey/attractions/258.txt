Dalkey Island | County Dublin, Ireland |  Dalkey Island's main sight is St Begnet's Holy Well, but it's also a popular spot for fishing, with shoals of pollock, mackerel and coalfish feeding in its waters. It's also a lovely spot to spend a couple of hours with a picnic â€“ but be sure to take everything off the island with you when you leave. Ken the Ferryman provides transport to and from the island.
