Lartigue Monorailway | County Kerry, Ireland |  Designed by Frenchman Charles Lartigue, this unique survivor of Victorian railway engineering once ran between Listowel and Ballybunion along the coast. The renovated section of line is short (less than a kilometre) but fascinating, with manual turntables at either end for swinging the train around.
