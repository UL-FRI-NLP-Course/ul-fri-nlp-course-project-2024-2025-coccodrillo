Fahan Beehive Huts | Dingle Peninsula, Ireland |  Fahan, on the roadside 7.5km southwest of Ventry, once had some 48 drystone cloch√°n beehive huts dating from AD 500, although the exact dates are unknown. Today five structures remain, including two that are fully intact. The huts are on the slope of Mt Eagle (516m), which still has an estimated 400-plus huts in various states of preservation.
