Captain Webb's Hole | County Mayo, Ireland |  Just west of the village is the water-filled Captain Webb's Hole. Two centuries ago, a local villain, nicknamed Captain Webb for the deformity of his hands and feet, is said to have lured a succession of 12 women here, stripped them and hurled them into the hole's soggy depths to die.
His would-be 13th victim, however, was canny. She asked Webb to look away as she undressed, then promptly pushed him to his own watery grave.
