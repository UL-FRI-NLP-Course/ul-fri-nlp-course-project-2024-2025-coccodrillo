O'Doherty's Keep | Inishowen Peninsula, Ireland |  At the northern end of the seafront, the picture-perfect early-18th-century, six-arched Castle Bridge leads to these tower-house ruins originally built by the O'Dohertys, the local chiefs, in 1430. It was burned by the English and then rebuilt for their own use.
