Ballymastocker Beach | County Donegal, Ireland |  Once named the second-most beautiful beach in the world by British newspaper the Observer, this tawny-coloured Blue Flag beach is a supremely fine place to while away the hours. It is indeed stunning as you drive round the high headland on the R268 and it rears into view, but put the brakes on â€“ there's a viewpoint you can pull into to take mesmerising shots.
