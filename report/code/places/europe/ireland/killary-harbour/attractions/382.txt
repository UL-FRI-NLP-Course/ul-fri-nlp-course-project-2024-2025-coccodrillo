Sheep & Wool Centre | Connemara, Ireland |  On Leenane's main street, just north of the bridge, sits a compelling little museum dedicated to sheep and wool. It has spinning and weaving demonstrations, and covers the history of dyeing. The on-site shop sells locally made handicrafts as well as topographical walking maps.
