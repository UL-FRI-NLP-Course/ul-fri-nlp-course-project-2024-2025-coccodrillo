Lackan Strand | County Mayo, Ireland |  Lackan Bay's beach is a stunning and vast expanse of golden sand â€“ it's particularly beautiful as the sun goes down, making it one of Ireland's most gorgeous bays. There's good surf here and plenty of places to get lost. Follow the R314 about 4.5km northwest from Killala, then turn at the signpost for Kilcummin.
