Ledwidge Museum | County Meath, Ireland |  This quaint cottage, 1km east of Slane on the N51, was the birthplace of poet Francis Ledwidge (1887â€“1917). A keen political activist, Ledwidge was thwarted in his efforts to set up a local Gaelic League branch, but found an outlet in verse. He died on the battlefield at Ypres, having survived Gallipoli and Serbia. The museum provides an insight into Ledwidge's works, and the cottage itself is a humbling example of how farm labourers lived in the 19th century.
