Banquet Hall | County Meath, Ireland |  Tara's most unusual feature is a rectangular earthwork measuring 230m by 27m along a northâ€“south axis. Tradition holds that it was built to cater for thousands of guests during feasts.Its orientation suggests that it was a sunken entrance to Tara, leading directly to the Royal Enclosure. More recent research, however, has uncovered graves within the compound, and it's possible that the banks are in fact the burial sites of some of the kings of Tara.
