Brigit's Garden | Connemara, Ireland |  Covering 4.5 hectares of woodland and meadowland, and with traditional architecture including a reed-thatched crann√≥g roundhouse, tranquil Brigit's Garden is dedicated to Celtic myth and heritage. Four gardens represent seasonal Celtic festivals: Samhain (winter), Imbolc (spring), Bealtaine (summer) and Lughnasa (autumn). There's also a huge sundial (Ireland's largest) and a sustainability zone with solar panels, a wood pellet boiler and a polytunnel. Salads and herbs from the gardens are used at the on-site cafe. It's 9km southeast of Oughterard.
