Teampall Bheanáin | Aran Islands, Ireland |  Tiny Teampall Bheanáin dates from the 11th century. Measuring just 3m by 3m, it's thought to have been a hermitage. Unusually for a religious structure, it's oriented on a north–south axis rather than east–west. The views over Cill Éinne Bay are outstanding.
It's just over 2km southeast of Kilronan.
