Athenry Dominican Priory | County Galway, Ireland |  Destroyed by Cromwellian troops in 1652, these marvellous 13th-century priory ruins are only accessible by asking the Arts & Heritage Centre to send someone to show you around. The priory tower survived till 1845, before collapsing. Tombs and grave slabs within the ruins include that of the Anglo-Irish lord Meiler de Bermingham, founder of the priory.
