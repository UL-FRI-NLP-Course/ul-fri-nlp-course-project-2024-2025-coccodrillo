Tholsel | Kilkenny City, Ireland |  Kilkenny's Tholsel (City Hall) was built in 1761 on the spot where Dame Alice Kytelerâ€™s maid Petronella was burned at the stake in 1324 for witchcraft (even if it was actually Dame Alice who was most likely the 'guilty' party). Architectural features include a five-arch cloister and an octagonal tower with a clock and copper weathervane. The interior is closed to the public.
