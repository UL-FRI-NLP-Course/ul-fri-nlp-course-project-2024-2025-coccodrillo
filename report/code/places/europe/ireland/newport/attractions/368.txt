Burrishoole Abbey | County Mayo, Ireland |  From a distance, the eerie shell of this wind-battered 1470-built Dominican abbey near the water is quite a sight. Leaving Newport in a northwest direction along the N59 towards Achill Island, a sign points the way to this stunning abbey, and from there itâ€™s a further 1km to the car park.
