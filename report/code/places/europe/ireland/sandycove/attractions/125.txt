James Joyce Tower & Museum | County Dublin, Ireland |  This tower is where the action begins in Joyce's epic novel Ulysses. The museum was opened in 1962 by Sylvia Beach, the Paris-based publisher who first dared to put Ulysses into print, and has photographs, letters, documents, various editions of Joyce's work and two death masks of Joyce on display. Tours are available by prior arrangement.
