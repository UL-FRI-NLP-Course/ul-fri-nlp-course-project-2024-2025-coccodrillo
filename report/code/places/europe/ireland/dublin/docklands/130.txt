James Connolly Memorial | Dublin, Ireland |  Ireland’s most famous socialist, James Connolly (1868–1916), is depicted proudly in front of the plough and stars of his Irish Citizen Army. An influential organiser for workers' rights, his role in the 1916 Easter Rising cemented his legacy, with his particularly cruel execution helping to fan the flames of Irish independence.
