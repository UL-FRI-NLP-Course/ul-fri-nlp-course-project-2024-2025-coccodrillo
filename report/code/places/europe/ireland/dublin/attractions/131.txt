Airfield | Dublin, Ireland |  Once the home of eccentric philanthropist sisters Letitia and Naomi Overend, the Airfield estate is now held in trust for public use. Though the house is closed to the public (except for the excellent cafe), the lovely 16-hectare grounds with walled gardens, pet farm, vintage-car museum and medicinal garden are great for a stroll.
