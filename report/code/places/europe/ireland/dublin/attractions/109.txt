Strawberry Beds | Dublin, Ireland |  Running alongside the northern banks of the Liffey between the villages of Chapelizod and Lucan, roughly along the western edge of Phoenix Park, is the Strawberry Beds, so-called on account of the fruits once grown here and sold along the side of the road.Before the days of flight, it was a popular honeymoon destination for Dubliners; the Chapelizod end was James Joyce's favourite spot for contemplating the Liffey. You'll need your own transport to get here.
