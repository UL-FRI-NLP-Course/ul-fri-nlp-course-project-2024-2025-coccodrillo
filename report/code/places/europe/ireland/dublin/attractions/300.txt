Pearse Museum | Dublin, Ireland |  This handsome Palladian mansion was home to St Enda’s, an experimental Gaelic school established by nationalist poet and 1916 martyr Pádraig Pearse. The exhibition focusing on Pearse’s life and pedagogical theories is centred on a 20-minute audiovisual show called ‘This Man Kept a School’. The beautiful grounds, gardens and grottoes surrounding the house are also worth an amble.
