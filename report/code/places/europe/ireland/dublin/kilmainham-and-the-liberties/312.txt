Roe & Co Distillery | Dublin, Ireland |  The newest kid in Dublin’s distillery district, Roe & Co took up residence in 2019 in the old Guinness Power Station, a cool brick building opposite the main brewery entrance. The emphasis here is on cocktails – after a traditional tasting you learn about flavour profiles in a mixology workshop, before heading to the bar to sample the bartender’s wares. Book ahead.
