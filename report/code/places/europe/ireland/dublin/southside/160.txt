National Print Museum | Dublin, Ireland |  You don’t have to be into printing to enjoy this quirky little museum, where personalized guided tours are offered in a delightfully casual and compelling way. A video looks at the history of printing in Ireland, and then you wander through the various (still working) antique presses amid the smell of ink and metal.
The guides are excellent and can tailor the tours to suit your special interests – for example, anyone interested in history can get a detailed account of the difficulties encountered by the rebels of 1916 when they tried to have the proclamation printed. Upstairs there are lots of old newspaper pages recording important episodes in Irish history over the last century. It's recommended that you email at least two weeks ahead to schedule a tour. Free tours are offered on Sundays on a first-come, first-served basis.
