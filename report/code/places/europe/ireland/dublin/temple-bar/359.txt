Contemporary Music Centre | Temple Bar, Dublin |  Anyone with an interest in Irish contemporary music must visit the CMC’s national archive where you can hear (and play around on an electronic organ) 10,000 samples from composers of this and the last century. There’s also a good reference library where you can attend courses and meet composers.
