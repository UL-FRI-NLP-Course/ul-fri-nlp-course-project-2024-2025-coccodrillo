National Wax Museum Plus | Temple Bar, Dublin |  More a mini history museum in wax than Dublin's version of Madame Tussauds. The quality of the waxworks remains inconsistent â€“ some look like the result of a hastily conceived school project. Still, the Chamber of Horrors (Dracula has a starring role) is pretty good, while late 2019 saw the addition of a Game of Thrones exhibit. The 'plus' in the name refers to the interactive use of video and music. Buy tickets online for a 10% discount.
