Europa Point | Gibraltar, Europe |  Gibraltar's southernmost tip, at the end of Europa Rd, hosts a mosque, a Catholic church, a 19th-century lighthouse, the restored 1878 Harding's Battery and a monument to former Polish general Wladyslaw Sikorski, who died in a plane crash near Gibraltar airport during WWII. On clear days, the Rif Mountains of North Africa shimmer on the horizon.
