Aalborg Zoo | Aalborg, Denmark |  Teeming with feathered, furry and four-legged friends, it’s no surprise this zoo is one of Denmark’s most popular. Some 1200 animals call it home, including tigers, zebras, elephants, giraffes, chimpanzees, penguins, and brown and polar bears. It’s southwest of the city and can be reached by bus 11; closing times vary, so check the website.
