Storebælts-forbindelsen | Zealand, Denmark |  Some 18km long and incorporating a suspension bridge that's arguably as elegant as the Golden Gate, the Storebælt link is a remarkable piece of engineering linking Funen and Zealand on what has been dubbed Denmark's biggest man-made structure.
Arguably the best views of the bridge are from near the Isbådsmuseet, close to the link's eastern end in Korsør.
