Kvindemuseet | Aarhus, Denmark |  Denmark is a model for equality, but this hasn’t always been the case. In a fresh, engaging exhibition inside the old town hall, the Women's Museum charts women’s lives in Denmark and their hard-won achievements. It’s inspiring stuff, but it’s not just one for the ladies – families will love the hands-on kids’ exhibits in the ‘History of Childhood’ section. There’s also a pretty cafe here.
