Carl-Henning Pedersen & Else Alfelts Museum | Central Jutland, Denmark |  Across the street from HEART contemporary-art museum, this place showcases the riotously colourful paintings, watercolours, mosaics, ceramics and sculptures of artists Carl-Henning Pedersen (1913–2007) and Else Alfelt (1910–74); there’s a large sculpture park beyond the museum.
