Bornholms Middelaldercenter | Bornholm, Denmark |  This 'Medieval Centre' re-creates a medieval fort and village, and gives the Danes another chance to do what they love best: dressing up in period costume and hitting each other with rubber swords. They also operate a smithy, tend fields, grind wheat in a water mill and perform other chores of yore throughout the summer months. In July the activity schedule is beefed up to include archery demonstrations and hands-on activities for children.
Opening hours are reduced (as are prices and activities) outside the summer peak.The centre is 500m north of Østerlars Rundkirke and can be reached by either bus 1 or 9 from Gudhjem, or bus 4 from Rønne.
