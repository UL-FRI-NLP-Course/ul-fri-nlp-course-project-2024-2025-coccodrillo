Helligdomsklipperne | Bornholm, Denmark |  These (moderately) high coastal cliffs of sharp granite rock attract sightseers and walkers. You can access them via a path behind Bornholms Kunstmuseum, or via a set of walking trails that connect with Gudhjem (5km east). A daily boat travels from Gudhjem to a small landing place at the base of the cliffs, where a set of steps leads up.
