Gefion Fountain | Copenhagen, Denmark |  At the southeastern edge of Kastellet is Anders Bundgaard's monumental Gefion Fountain, depicting the Norse goddess Gefion steering some rather stoic oxen. The fountain was donated to the city by the Carlsberg Foundation to celebrate the brewery's 50th anniversary in 1897.
