Dansk Arkitektur Center | Copenhagen, Denmark |  This gallery hosts changing exhibitions on Danish and international architecture and features an excellent book- and design-shop. On weekends from late May to September, DAC also runs 90-minute walking tours of the city's contemporary architecture (125kr). From May 2018, you will find the Danish Architecture Centre inside the new, harbourside Blox building, designed by Dutch 'starchitect' Rem Koolhaas. See the website for updates.
