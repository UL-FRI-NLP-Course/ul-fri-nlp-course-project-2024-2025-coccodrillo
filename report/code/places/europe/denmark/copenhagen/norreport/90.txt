Palmehus | Copenhagen, Denmark |  Forget Thailand: to escape the Nordic cold, simply slip inside the Botanic Garden's Palm House. A large, elegant glasshouse dating from the 19th century, its dense collection of plants from continents as far flung as Australia make for a quick, steamy escape. The main circular section features wrought-iron spiral staircases leading to an elevated walkway with a bird's-eye view of the 'jungle' below.
