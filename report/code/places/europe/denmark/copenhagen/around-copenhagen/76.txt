Frilandsmuseet | Copenhagen, Denmark |  The main sight of interest in the Lyngby area is Frilandsmuseet, a sprawling open-air museum of old countryside dwellings that have been gathered from sites around Denmark. Its 100-plus historic buildings are arranged in groupings that provide a sense of Danish rural life as it was in various regions and across different social strata.
Frilandsmuseet is an 850m signposted walk from Sorgenfri station, a 25-minute train journey from Central Station on S-train line B. You can also take bus 184 or 194, both of which stop at the entrance.
