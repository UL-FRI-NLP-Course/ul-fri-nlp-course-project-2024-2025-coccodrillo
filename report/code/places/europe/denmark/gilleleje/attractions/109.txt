Rudolph Tegners Museum & Statuepark | Zealand, Denmark |  If you wander through this rare patch of lonely, untamed moorland heath, you'll come across a series of 14 classically styled monumental bronze sculptures, appearing as though by magic on hillocks and in clearings. These are the work of Rudolph Tegner (1873–1950) whose museum-mausoleum displays over 250 more of his pieces in a discordant concrete building beside the car park.
