Glastorvet | Bornholm, Denmark |  If you’re interested in crafts, there are a number of ceramics and handicraft shops dotted around town, and at Glastorvet in the town centre there’s a workshop of renowned local designer Pernille Bülow, where you can watch glass being melted into orange glowing lumps and then blown into clear, elegant glassware. This is a lovely spot to explore local flavours and artisans.
