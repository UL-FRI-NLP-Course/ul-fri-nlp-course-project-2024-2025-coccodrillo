HC Andersen Museum | Odense, Denmark |  This striking exhibition takes its design cues from Hans Christian Andersen's playful papercuts, and features his personal effects plus a virtual reality nose around his Copenhagen study. It's heavy on biography and light on his stories, with less to do for kids than you might expect, but it's a decent stopgap while the new Andersen museum (due to open in June 2021) is under construction.
