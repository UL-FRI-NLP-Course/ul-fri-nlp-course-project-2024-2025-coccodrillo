HC Andersens Hus | Odense, Denmark |  Lying amid the seemingly miniaturised streets of the former poor quarter is the sparse little cottage where Hans Christian Andersen was born. Visiting it is a small part of a much bigger, modern museum experience that gives a thorough, lively account of Andersen’s extraordinary life. His achievements are put into interesting historical context and leavened by some engaging audiovisual material and quirky exhibits.
There’s also a reconstruction of his Copenhagen study, displays of his pen-and-ink sketches and paper cuttings, and a voluminous selection of his books, which have been translated into some 140 languages. The ticket gets you same-day entry to HC Andersens Barndomshjem, HC Andersen Museum, Møntergården and Børnekulturhuset Fyrtøjet.
