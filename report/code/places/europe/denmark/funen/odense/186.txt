Albani Brewery | Odense, Denmark |  Founded in 1859, the city's ubiquitous Odense beers are brewed by Albani right in the heart of town, though the company is now part of conglomerate Royal Unibrew. Oddly the brewery's snazzy office won't sell visitors any of its products but the brewery building has big glass windows that you can peer through to observe the bottling line.
