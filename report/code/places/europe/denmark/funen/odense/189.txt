Børnekulturhuset Fyrtøjet | Odense, Denmark |  In the charming Fyrtøjet, children are encouraged to explore the world of Hans Christian Andersen through music and storytelling.
Though the latter is in Danish, many activities are suitable for all languages. Kids can dress up, have their face painted, act out stories and draw fairy-tale pictures in the art studio.
