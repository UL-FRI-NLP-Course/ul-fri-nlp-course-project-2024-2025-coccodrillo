Museum for Samtidskunst | Zealand, Denmark |  Though it's housed in Roskilde's elegant 18th-century royal palace, this museum focuses on Fluxus art, often perplexing sound, video or performance installations by Danish and international artists. In most of the eight rooms, exhibits change periodically, but one permanent feature is Morgans Jacobsen's 'Soundbar,' where you select bottles from shelves and imbibe their auditory stimuli.
