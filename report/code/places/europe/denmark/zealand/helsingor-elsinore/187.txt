Værftsmuseet | Helsingør, Denmark |  This free museum hosts changing exhibitions that highlight the role of shipbuilding in Helsingør's 19th- and 20th-century history. Once the city's main industry, the shipyard employed more than 3000 workers in the 1960s before slumping in the 1970s and closing altogether in 1983. Outside are memorable statues of striding shipworkers.
