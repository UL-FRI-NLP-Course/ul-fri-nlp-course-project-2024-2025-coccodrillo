Sankt Olai Domkirke | Helsingør, Denmark |  The handsome, red-brick Sankt Olai Domkirke is a Gothic cathedral built in 1559 on the site of a 13th-century original. Eclectic features include a remarkable 1579 brass baptismal font and an over-the-top gilded altarpiece which, at 12m tall, is one of Denmark’s largest.
Hanging in the ceiling vault above the small organ of the northeastern chancel is a cannonball that was fired at Helsingør by the British fleet as it passed by, three days before the Battle of Copenhagen (1801).
