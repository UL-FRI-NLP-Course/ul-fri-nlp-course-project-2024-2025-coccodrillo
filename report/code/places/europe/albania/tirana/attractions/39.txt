Statue of the Unknown Partisan | Tirana, Albania |  The socialist realist Statue of the Unknown Partisan, just off Sheshi Skënderbej, seems to be aiming his weapons at the Parliament building (1924) down the road. Nowadays day labourers wait for work at the foot of the statue, some with their own jackhammers – a fitting image of the precarious position of the postcommunist Albanian worker.
