Pyramid | Tirana, Albania |  Designed by Enver Hoxha's daughter and son-in-law and completed in 1988, this building was formerly the Enver Hoxha Museum and more recently a convention centre and nightclub. Once covered in graffiti and with crumbling walls, the structure has been completely renovated in recent years.
