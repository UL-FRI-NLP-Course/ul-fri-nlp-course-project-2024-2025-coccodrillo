National Archaeological Museum | Tirana, Albania |  The collection here is comprehensive and impressive in parts, but there's only minimal labelling in Albanian and none at all in English (nor are tours in English offered), so you may find yourself a little at a loss unless this is your field. A total renovation is on the cards, but as one staff member pointed out to us, they've been waiting for that since 1985 â€“ so don't hold your breath.
