Durrës Archaeological Museum | Durrës, Albania |  This ultra-modern, well lit and labelled museum just back from the seafront has a breathtaking collection of historical artefacts. Highlights include the fine-boned sculptures and statues, delicate gold jewellery, amphoras recovered from the seafloor and still covered in barnacles and beautiful painted vases and pots that are so perfectly preserved they look as if they were painted just yesterday. Allow at least an hour for a visit.
