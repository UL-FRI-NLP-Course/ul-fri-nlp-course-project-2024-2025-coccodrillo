Synagogue | Saranda, Albania |  These ruins of a 5th-century synagogue are located right in the heart of town and provide evidence of one of the earliest Balkan-Jewish communities. There are four floor mosaics here, which are normally covered with sand to protect them, though photos are provided on the walls. Although there are official opening times and admission fees, the gates are often left open with nobody in attendance to charge you.
