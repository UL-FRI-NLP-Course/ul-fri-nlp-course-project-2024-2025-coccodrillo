Borgarvirki | North Iceland, Iceland |  Take the detour off Rte 711 (or accessed via Rte 716 off the Ring Road) to reach mysterious Borgarvirki, believed to be a defensive fortification from the early years of Icelandic history. It's a natural rock formation (an ancient 'volcanic plug' of columnar basalt) and sits 177m above the landscapes, offering both a great place for a scramble and sweeping vistas.
