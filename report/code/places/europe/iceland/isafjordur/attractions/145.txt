Culture House | Ísafjörður, Iceland |  The intensely close-knit nature of Westfjords life is evoked in the 2nd-floor displays in what was once the town hospital. Look out for vintage scales for newborns, a disturbing hacksaw and an eye-watering enema device, and the touching testimonies of former patients.
The ground floor is occupied by the town library.
