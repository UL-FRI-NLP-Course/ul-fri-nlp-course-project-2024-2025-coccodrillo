Saxhöll Crater | Snæfellsjökull National Park, Iceland |  Southeast of the Öndverðarnes area, on Rte 574, follow the marked turn-off to the roadside scoria crater Saxhöll, which was responsible for some of the lava in the area. There’s a drivable track leading to the base, from where it’s an uneven 300m climb for magnificent views over the enormous Neshraun lava flows.
