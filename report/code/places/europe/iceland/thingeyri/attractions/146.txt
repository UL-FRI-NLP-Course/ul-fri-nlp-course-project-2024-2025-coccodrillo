Old Blacksmith's Workshop | The Westfjords, Iceland |  It was the first of its kind in Iceland when it was created in 1913, and today Þingeyri's atmospheric Old Blacksmith's Workshop is still crammed with original machinery and tools. It's part of Ísafjörður's Westfjords Heritage Museum; the ticket includes admission to both sights.
