Skrímslasetur Icelandic Sea Monster Museum | The Westfjords, Iceland |  Moody, fun, elaborate and dramatic exhibits about Icelandic and foreign monster legends fill the rooms here. The interactive multimedia table tells 180 stories of local sightings. You won't look at Arnarfjörður in quite the same way again.
While it's great for larger kids, wee ones might get freaked out by some of the giant models. The museum also has a small cafe.
