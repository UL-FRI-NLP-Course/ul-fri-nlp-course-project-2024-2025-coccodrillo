Kerið | The Golden Circle, Iceland |  Around 15.5km north of Selfoss on Rte 35, Kerið is a 6500-year-old explosion crater with vivid red and sienna earth and containing an ethereal green lake. Björk once performed a concert from a floating raft in the middle. Visitors can easily walk around the entire rim (it takes between 10 and 20 minutes), and go down to the lake in the crater.
