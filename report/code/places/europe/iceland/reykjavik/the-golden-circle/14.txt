Gullfoss | The Golden Circle, Iceland |  Icelandâ€™s most famous waterfall, Gullfoss is a spectacular double cascade dropping a dramatic 32m. As it descends, it kicks up magnificent walls of spray before thundering down a rocky ravine. On sunny days the mist creates shimmering rainbows, while in winter the falls glitter with ice. Although it's a popular sight, the remote location still makes you feel the ineffable forces of nature that have worked this landscape for millennia.
Above the falls there's a tourist information centre, shop and cafe, plus bathrooms (the ones inside are free to use).
