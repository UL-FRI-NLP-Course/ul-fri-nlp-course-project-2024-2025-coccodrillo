Library of Water | Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula, Iceland |  For relaxing views of town and bay, head up the hill to the Library of Water. This window-lined space showcases an installation by American artist Roni Horn (b 1955). Light reflects and refracts through 24 glass pillars filled with Icelandic glacier water. There's also a chess set if you feel like lingering.
