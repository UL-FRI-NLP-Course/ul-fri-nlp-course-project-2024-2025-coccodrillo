Exploration Museum | North Iceland, Iceland |  Opened in 2014, this museum salutes the history of human exploration, covering Viking voyages and polar expeditions, but its most nootable exhibition focuses on the Apollo astronauts in Iceland in the 1960s, who received geology training in the lunar-like landscapes near Askja. There are some great photos from this era, and museum operators organised a return of some of the astronauts in 2015.
