Ystafell Transportation Museum | North Iceland, Iceland |  Some 37km south of Húsavík on Rte 85 (or about 9km off the Ring Road), this impressive, remote museum is well worth a stop for any petrolheads passing through. It's a quirky and sprawling collection of half a century's worth of vehicles, from Trabants to snowmobiles to army jeeps. Stop by the workshops to see restorations in progress.
