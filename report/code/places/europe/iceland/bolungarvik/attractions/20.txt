Ósvör Maritime Museum | The Westfjords, Iceland |  The old turf-and-stone fishing shacks of the Ósvör Maritime Museum powerfully evoke a past age. A guide in a typical lambskin fisher’s outfit shows you around the shore-side settlement, outlining its history and traditional seafaring life from the Settlement Era to the present day. There's also a cramped fishers' hut full of relics and a rowing boat.
The museum is down a turning to the right, just after you emerge from the tunnel heading into Bolungarvík from Ísafjörður.
