Grænavatn | Reykjanesfólkvangur Reserve, Iceland |  Just to the north of the Seltún hot springs, this lake is an old explosion crater filled with gorgeous teal water, caused by a combination of minerals and warmth-loving algae. The gravel road to the lake may only be drivable with 4WD and could be impassible at various times of year.
