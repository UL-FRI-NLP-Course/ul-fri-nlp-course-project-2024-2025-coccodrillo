Archaeological Museum of Kythira | Kythira, Greece |  Hora’s impressive archaeological museum, beside the main road at the northern end of town, traces the history of ‘this small island’ in two rooms. Among artefacts from the ancient settlements of Palaiopolis and Palaiokastro, pride of place goes to the white-marble statue known as the Lion of Kythira.
