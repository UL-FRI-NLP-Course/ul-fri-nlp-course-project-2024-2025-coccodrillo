Metalia Beach | Thasos, Greece |  Easily accessible on foot from Limenaria, this pretty cove features an elegiac retro-industrial sight in the form of a mining factory built by German entrepreneur Speidel in 1900. The ruins form an amphitheatre around the beach, with a colonial-styled green administrative building, sadly abandoned, towering above the headland.
