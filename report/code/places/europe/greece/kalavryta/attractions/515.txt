Martyrsâ€™ Monument | Peloponnese, Greece |  A huge white cross on a cypress-covered hillside just east of town marks the site where the German army machine-gunned nearly 500 men and boys from Kalavryta on 13 December 1943. Only 13 survived the massacre. Beneath this imposing monument is a poignant little shrine to the victims. It's signposted off Konstantinou.
