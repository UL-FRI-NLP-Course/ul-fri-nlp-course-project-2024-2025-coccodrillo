Ktima Bairaktaris | Peloponnese, Greece |  This modern family winery is set among spectacular craggy scenery on the outskirts of modern Nemea. Try their dry-as-a-bone moschofilero white or their excellent agiorgitiko reds. They age wines here, so you can taste how a wine improves over the years. A winery tour is usually thrown in.
