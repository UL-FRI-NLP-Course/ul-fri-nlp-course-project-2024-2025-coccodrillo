Church of Ypapantis | Kalamata, Greece |  Kalamata's massive 19th-century cathedral is home to the icon after which the town takes its modern name. Pilgrims visit for its miracle-working icon of the Virgin Mary known as kalo mata (good eye). The icon was discovered in the stables of the Ottoman aga (governor), who converted to Christianity as a result of the miracles it was believed to have performed.
