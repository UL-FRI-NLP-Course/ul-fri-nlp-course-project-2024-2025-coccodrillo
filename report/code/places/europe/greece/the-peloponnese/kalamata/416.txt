Military Museum | Kalamata, Greece |  One for war buffs, this museum's displays depict Greek military history from the Turkish occupation to the Greek Resistance to Nazi occupation and 21st-century peacekeeping efforts through grisly paintings, photos, and ample displays of uniforms and weaponry. Most of the signs are in Greek, but cheerful young national-service recruits are on hand to give tours in basic English.
