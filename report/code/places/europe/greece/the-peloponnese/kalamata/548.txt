Museum of Traditional Greek Costumes | Kalamata, Greece |  Opened in 2017, this stunning museum features a remarkable collection of Greek costumes that was donated by Victoria Karelia. Far from moth-eaten old hand-me-downs, the clothing showcases male and female folk dress from the 18th to 20th centuries in beautifully curated, dramatically lit exhibits.
