Komboloi Museum | Nafplio, Greece |  Whether or not you wish to buy Greece's most popular souvenir item – komboloï (worry beads) – at the gift shop, it's worth popping into the incense-scented museum here to learn what distinguishes the komboloï from prayer beads and why the amber-mastic mix is so special. Among the collection of prayer beads belonging to assorted religions are tiny wooden skulls, and black coral beads inlaid with mother-of-pearl and carved ivory.
