Bouboulina’s Museum | Saronic Gulf Islands, Greece |  The mansion of Spetses’ famous daughter, the 19th-century seagoing commander Laskarina Bouboulina, has been converted into a museum. Entry is via 40-minute guided tours (billboards around town advertise starting times, also posted online). The museum hosts occasional concerts. There’s an impressive statue of Bouboulina on the harbour, opposite the Poseidonion Grand Hotel.
