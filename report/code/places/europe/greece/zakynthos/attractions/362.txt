Monastery of St George | Zakynthos, Greece |  In an evocative clifftop site, the Monastery of St George has an interior covered in faded frescoes. The strange tower at the centre of the complex was used by monks as a defence from pirate and Turkish attack: the monks would hide inside and throw boiling olive oil over their attackers. Today the only Turkish thing about the monastery are the free Turkish delights that are made by one of the monks and given to visitors!
