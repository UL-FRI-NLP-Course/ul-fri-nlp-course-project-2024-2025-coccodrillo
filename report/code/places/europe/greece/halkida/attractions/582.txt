Kokkino Spiti | Evia, Greece |  Halkida's 19th-century grandeur just about endures at the waterfront Kokkino Spiti mansion, dating from 1884. Built into the rock, it became headquarters for the occupying Germans in WWII, and now hosts an array of exhibitions. It's at the north end of the seafront promenade.
