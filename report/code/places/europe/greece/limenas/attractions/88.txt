Archaeological Museum | Thasos, Greece |  Looking like an alien creature from the sci-fi movie Avatar, a 5m-tall 6th-century-BC kouros (male statue of the Archaic period) carrying a ram greets visitors at this large, modern archaeological museum. Statues and other artefacts from the Classical and Roman periods are on display. The museum is located about 100m from the Old Harbour's waterfront.
