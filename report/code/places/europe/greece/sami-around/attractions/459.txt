Drogarati Cave | Kefallonia, Greece |  A popular stop for round-island coach tours, Drogarati Cave is a natural cavern hollowed into the hillside 4km south of Sami. A short, steep stairway drops from the ticket booth; once you're down, it takes 10 minutes at most to walk around the single large subterranean chamber, festooned with dripping stalactites. A couple of tavernas stand alongside.
