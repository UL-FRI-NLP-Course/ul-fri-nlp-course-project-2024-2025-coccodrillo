Mercouri Estate | Peloponnese, Greece |  This handsome estate, bristling with peacocks, produces a range of wines, including its delicious flagship red Domaine Mercouri. Unless you book a visit in advance, they will probably sell you a glass of wine and invite you to roam the grounds rather than conduct a proper tasting. It's located on the edge of Korakohori village, about 15km from Pyrgos.
