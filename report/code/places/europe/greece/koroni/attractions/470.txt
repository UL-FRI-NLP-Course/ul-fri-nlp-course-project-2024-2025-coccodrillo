Kastro | Messinia, Greece |  The castle complex crowns a bluff overlooking the town. Much of it is occupied by the Timios Prodromos Convent, where a dress code applies. You can enter via the castle’s impressive Gothic entrance. The small promontory beyond the castle is a tranquil place for a stroll, with lovely views over the bay to the Taÿgetos Mountains.
