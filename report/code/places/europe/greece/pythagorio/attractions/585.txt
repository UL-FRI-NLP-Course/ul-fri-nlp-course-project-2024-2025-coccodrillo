Moni Panagias Spilianis | Samos, Greece |  About 1.5km northwest of Pythagorio, the road forks right, past traces of an ancient theatre, before reaching this grotto monastery. The walk meanders up through old olive groves; it's a welcome respite from the summer heat and gives clear views to the nearby Turkish coast.
