War Museum | Dodecanese, Greece |  Who remembers now that a major WWII battle was fought on this remote little island? After British troops forced the Italians to surrender in September 1943, a massive German air onslaught recaptured the island in the Battle of Leros. A network of tunnels dug by the Italians beneath the woods west of Lakki now serves as a museum, housing countless relics of the conflict. There's an explanatory video.
