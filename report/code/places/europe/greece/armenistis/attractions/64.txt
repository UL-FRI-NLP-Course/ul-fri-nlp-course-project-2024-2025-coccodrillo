Nas Beach | Ikaria, Greece |  Westward 3.5km from Armenistis lies the pebbled beach of Nas, lying below the road and the few tavernas. A nudist-friendly beach, it has an impressive location at the mouth of a forested river, behind the trace ruins of an ancient Temple of Artemis, easily viewed from Artemis Studios.
