Museum of History & Art | Central Greece, Greece |  The ground floor of this neoclassical mansion on the central square holds a fine collection of Byron memorabilia. Treasures range from statues and paintings to pictures of Byronâ€™s sword and helmet (now in Athens); there's also a cricket bat signed by Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Upstairs the theme extends to the Greek War of Independence in general, with a large copy of a painting by Delacroix commemorating the sufferings of Messolongi.
