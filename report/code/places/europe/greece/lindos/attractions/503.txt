Lindos Main Beach | Lindos, Greece |  The larger of Lindos' two superb beaches stretches north along the innermost shoreline of the bay, north of the village. Known logically enough as Main Beach, it's sandy and shelves softly into the sea, making it a perfect swimming spot for kids. In summer it gets very crowded. There's free parking on the hillside just above.
