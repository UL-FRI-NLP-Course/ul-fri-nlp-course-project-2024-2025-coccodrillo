Pallas Beach | Lindos, Greece |  Tucked just below Lindos village, pocket-sized, taverna-fringed Pallas Beach is reached by a footpath that drops down near the start of the mule trail up to the Acropolis, and can also be accessed directly from Main Beach by a narrow coastal path. Donâ€™t swim near the jetty here, which is home to sea urchins, but if it gets too crowded you can launch yourself from the rocks beyond.
