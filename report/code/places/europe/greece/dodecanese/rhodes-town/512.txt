Liberty Gate | Rhodes Town, Greece |  The busiest entrance to the Old Town, close to the seafront and Mandraki Harbour, Liberty Gate was constructed in the 14th century to serve as a bridge to a medieval shipyard. It was originally fortified by two square towers, destroyed by the Ottoman occupiers in 1910; what you currently see is a modern reconstruction.
