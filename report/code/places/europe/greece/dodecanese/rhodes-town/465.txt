Panagia tou Kastrou | Rhodes Town, Greece |  Across from the tourist office and Archaeological Museum, this 11th-century church retains its original form, though after four centuries as a mosque and severe earthquake damage itâ€™s now basically an empty shell, used to display icons from the 15th to the 19th centuries. Visitors can wander into its pretty courtyard, hard against the town walls.
