Decorative Arts Collection | Rhodes Town, Greece |  This endearing little museum consists of a single large white-walled room, filled to the brim with everyday vernacular objects from the 18th and 19th centuries. From plates and pots to painted and carved wooden panels, rugs and wallhangings, everything is bursting with colour.
