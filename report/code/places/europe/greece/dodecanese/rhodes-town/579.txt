Inn of Provence | Rhodes Town, Greece |  Four coats of arms on the Inn of Provence form the shape of a cross. After Rhodes fell to the Ottomans, the building became a hammam (Turkish bath), while under Italian rule (1912–1943) it served as offices. These days it’s used by a women's club and as a private residence.
