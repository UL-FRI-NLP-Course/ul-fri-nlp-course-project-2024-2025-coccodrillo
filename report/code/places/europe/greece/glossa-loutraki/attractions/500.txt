Antoniou Family Olive Press | Skopelos, Greece |  Around 800m east of Glossa, signposted just beyond a petrol station, this 130-year-old, third-generation family-owned mill produces fine extra virgin olive oil that is harvested traditionally. Visitors are welcome to tour the modern facilities (with audio guides), taste products and, of course, stock up in the shop. Call ahead.
