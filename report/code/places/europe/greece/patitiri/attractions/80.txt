Alonnisos Museum | Alonnisos, Greece |  Patitiri's excellent town museum takes in antique nautical maps, traditional island costumes, an impressive collection of piratesâ€™ weapons and boarding equipment, and an absorbing display on wartime resistance, all with detailed multilingual info booklets. Downstairs there's a recreated farmhouse interior and artefacts relating to traditional local crafts and industries, from mining to olive-oil production. It's signposted above Bar St at the southwest end of town.
