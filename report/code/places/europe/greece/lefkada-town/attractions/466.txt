Fortress of Agia Mavra | Lefkada, Greece |  Guarding Lefkada at the start of the causeway, 1.4km from town, the Agia Mavra fortress was constructed in the 14th century and later expanded by the Venetians. While its lichen-covered walls remain intact, surrounded by a saltwater moat, the interior now lies in ruins. You can enter the occasional bare chamber as you stroll among the wildflowers.
