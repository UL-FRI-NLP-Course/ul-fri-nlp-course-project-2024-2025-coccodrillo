Castle | Central Greece, Greece |  The well-preserved fortress and Venetian kastro that overlook Nafpaktos consist of a series of five terraced stone walls, built by successive conquerors (Doric, Roman, Byzantine, Venetian and Turk), that curl all the way down to the waterfront. Itâ€™s well worth the climb, for both the walk and the views from the hill.
To drive here, turn uphill at the Shell petrol station.
