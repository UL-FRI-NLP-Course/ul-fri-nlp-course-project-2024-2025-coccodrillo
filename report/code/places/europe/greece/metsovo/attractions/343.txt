Averoff Gallery | Epiros, Greece |  Founded by Evangelos Averoff to fulfil a long-held wish to crown his family's town with a quality gallery, this three-storey space exhibits works of Greek artists from the 19th century to the present day. There are some especially beautiful portraits and usually some interesting temporary exhibit on local culture, as well as a kids' art space. Look for the gallery on the south side of the park in the centre of town; it's just below street level.
