Grand Arsenal | Hania, Greece |  Impressively restored from a roofless ruin, the 16th-century Venetian arsenal was the last of the 17 shipyard buildings in Hania's Venetian Harbour. After stints as school, hospital and city hall, it is now home to the KAM Centre of Mediterranean Architecture, which hosts regular events and exhibitions.
