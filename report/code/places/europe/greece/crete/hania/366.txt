Venetian Fortifications | Hania, Greece |  Part of a defensive system begun in 1538 by Michele Sanmichele, who also designed Iraklio’s defences, Hania’s massive fortifications remain impressive. Best preserved is the western wall, running from the Firkas Fortress to the Siavo Bastion. Entrance to the fortress is via the gates next to the Maritime Museum. The bastion offers good views of the old town.
