Historical Museum & Archives | Hania, Greece |  The Historical Museum & Archives of Hania, about a 1.5km walk southeast of the old harbour, traces Crete’s war-torn history with a series of exhibits focusing on the struggle against the Turks. There is a section on WWII displaying an execution pole used by the German army and a katsouna (wooden crook) local Cretans used to kill German paratroopers. There are also belongings of national hero Eleftherios Venizelos (1864–1936), the Cretan leader and Greek prime minister, plus a folklore collection.
There's an English brochure and some English signs throughout.
