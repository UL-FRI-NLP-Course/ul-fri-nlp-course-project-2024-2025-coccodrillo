Ancient Kydonia | Hania, Greece |  The discovery of clay tablets with Linear B script during ongoing excavations on Kastelli Hill to the east of the Venetian Harbour has led archaeologists to conclude that present-day Hania sits atop an important Minoan city and palace site called Ancient Kydonia. The finest among the unearthed artefacts are displayed in Haniaâ€™s Archaeological Museum. There are information boards in English at the site of the ruins.
