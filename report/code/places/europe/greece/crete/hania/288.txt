Church of Agios Nikolaos | Hania, Greece |  One of Hania’s most intriguing buildings is this Venetian-era church with both a bell tower and a double-balconied minaret – the latter replaced a second bell tower during its stint as a mosque under Turkish rule. Inside, the massive bronze chandeliers dangling from a barrel-vaulted coffered ceiling will likely draw your attention.
The church was originally part of a Dominican monastery founded in 1320. The only section left from this era is the cross-vaulted arcade on the north side (off Vourdouba).
