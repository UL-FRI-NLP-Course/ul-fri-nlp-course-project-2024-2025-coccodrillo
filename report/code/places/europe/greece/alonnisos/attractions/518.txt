Kokkinokastro Beach | Alonnisos, Greece |  The gorgeous golden-white pebble-and-sand arc hugging red-tinged Cape Kokkinokastro, 6km northeast of Patitiri, was the site of the ancient, now-submerged city of Ikos, whose ruined fortified wall you can still make out. Expect a few sun loungers and umbrellas and a summer beach bar beside the gentle aqua waves.
