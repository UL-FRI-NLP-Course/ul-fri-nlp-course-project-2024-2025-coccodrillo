Chapel of Agios Georgios | Athens, Greece |  On the summit of Lykavittos Hill is the little Chapel of Agios Georgios, all in white with a dainty dome. It's floodlit at night and looks like a vision from a fairy tale from the streets below. Up close, it's slightly more pedestrian, as the current structure dates from 1834. It's a popular wedding spot and a destination for Easter services.
