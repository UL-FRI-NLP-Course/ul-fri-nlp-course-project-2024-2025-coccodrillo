Agiou Dionysiou Aeropagitou Church | Athens, Greece |  This massive church, named after Athens' patron saint, towers over a small plaza. Duck inside to see beautiful paintings by Spiros Vasiliou, splendid woodcarving by Theofanis Nomikos, and a giant chandelier that picks out the highlights in the glittery gold mosaic icons.
