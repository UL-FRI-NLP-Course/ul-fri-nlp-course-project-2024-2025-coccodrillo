Museum of the City of Athens | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  Housed in two interconnected buildings, including the palace where King Otto lived between 1830 and 1846, this small museum is not so much about the city's history, but about its influential people. The collection of royal furniture, antiques, paintings and personal mementoes has limited appeal.
