Museum of Folk Art & Tradition | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  The 1920s mansion of folklorist Angeliki Hatzimichalis (1895â€“1965), who wrote more than 100 books and articles about Greek traditions, is a window into the daily life of yore. It's a pretty house and a nice dip into regional costumes, embroidery and more, along with family portraits; note, photography of the exhibits is not allowed.
