Church of Agioi Anargyroi | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  Tucked away in Plaka, this 17th-century church is worth visiting any time for its peaceful courtyard and beautiful interior decoration. On the evening of Easter Saturday, a 'holy flame' is flown from the mother Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, and in ritual said to be over a millennium old, the faithful pack out the church to light their candles from it.
