Museum of the Bank of Greece | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  This museum covers the general history of money, from ancient times on. There's a token nod to the euro era, but really this place is about that venerable currency, the drachma, with some especially beautiful banknotes from the mid-20th century. Temporary exhibits often focus on the artists involved.
It may not be the most gripping museum, but it's nice to get something free from a bank.
