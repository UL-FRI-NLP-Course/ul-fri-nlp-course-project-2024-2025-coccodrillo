Electric Railways Museum | Piraeus, Greece |  Tucked inside the Piraeus station, this museum is a trove of old switches, nifty models and cool machinery, including a gleaming old wooden train car. It's a passion project of a former railway employee, and he and the other staff are full of interesting facts.
