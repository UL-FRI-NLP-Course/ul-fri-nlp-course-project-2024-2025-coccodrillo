TAF | Athens, Greece |  Whether you want a shot of art, a clever design morsel or a refreshing drink, stop in at TAF, a just-barely updated complex of 1870s brick buildings. The central courtyard is a cafe-bar that fills with an eclectic young crowd, and the surrounding rooms act as galleries, DJ space and an excellent souvenir shop. Events are usually free.
