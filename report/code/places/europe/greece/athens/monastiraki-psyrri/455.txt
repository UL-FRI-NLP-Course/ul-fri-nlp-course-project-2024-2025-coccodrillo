Museum Alex Mylona | Athens, Greece |  The permanent collection here is superminimalist sculpture and paintings by Athenian grande dame Alex Mylona, who died in 2016. The creatively refurbished mansion also hosts contemporary shows, and often includes dynamic video and sculpture by Alex's daughter, Eleni. Make sure you go up to the roof for a great view of the area. Entrance is on Lepeniotou.
