Ileana Tounta Contemporary Art Centre | Athens, Greece |  Established in 1988, this venerable arts hub in a warehouse is one of the more prestigious places to exhibit in the city. Shows include both Greek and international artists and cover all types of media. There's also a good art-book shop.
Return here in the evening for the cool attached bar-restaurant 48 Urban Garden, which – as the name suggests – has a partial garden setting, plus DJs and a kitchen serving street food operating out of an Airstream trailer.
