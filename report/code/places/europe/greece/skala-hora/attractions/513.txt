Livadi Beach | Dodecanese, Greece |  Astypalea’s most popular beach stands at the mouth of a lush valley in the first bay south of Hora. An easy 20-minute walk down from the old town, it’s also served by local buses. In summer it’s effectively transformed into a buzzing little resort, with a string of hip restaurants and bars lining the waterfront.
