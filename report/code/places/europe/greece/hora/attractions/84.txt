Monastery of the Apocalypse | Dodecanese, Greece |  Nestled amid the pines halfway to Hora, the Monastery of the Apocalypse focuses on the cave where St John lived as a hermit and received his revelation. Pilgrims and less-than-devout cruise passengers alike stream into the chapel built over the recess to see the rocky pillow where the saint rested his head, the handhold with which heâ€™d haul himself up from his prayers and the stone slab that served as his writing desk.
