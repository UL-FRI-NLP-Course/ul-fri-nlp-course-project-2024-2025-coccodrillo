Paleohora | Aegina, Greece |  This enchanting remote hillside is dotted with the remains of a Byzantine village. More than 30 surviving churches punctuate the rocky heights of the original citadel, and several have been refurbished. They are linked by a network of paths, carpeted with wildflowers in spring. The ancient town of Paleohora was Aegina’s capital from the 9th century through the medieval period and was only abandoned during the 1820s.
Paleohora is 6.5km east of Aegina Town, near enormous modern monastery Moni Agiou Nektariou. Buses from Aegina Town to Agia Marina stop at the turn-off to Paleohora (10 minutes); taxis cost €8 one way.
