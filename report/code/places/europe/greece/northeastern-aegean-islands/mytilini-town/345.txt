Theophilos Museum | Lesvos, Greece |  On the same site as the Teriade Museum, this humble structure contains 86 paintings by the primitive painter Theophilos, who remains a folk hero among Greek literati. During his life he barely scratched out an existence, moving frequently and painting coffeehouse walls for his daily bread, depicting the people he met at work and at play. A year after his death in 1934, his work was exhibited at the Louvre.
