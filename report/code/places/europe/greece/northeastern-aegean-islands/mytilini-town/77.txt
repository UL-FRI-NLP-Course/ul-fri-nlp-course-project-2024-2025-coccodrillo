Teriade Museum | Lesvos, Greece |  Extraordinary. It's worth coming to Lesvos for this alone – the Teriade Museum and its astonishing collection of paintings by artists including Picasso, Chagall, Miró, Le Corbusier and Matisse. The museum honours the Lesvos-born artist and critic Stratis Eleftheriadis, who brought the work of primitive painter and Lesvos native Theophilos to international attention. Located in Varia, 4km south of Mytilini.
It is in an incongruous location, but please: don't let this put you off.
