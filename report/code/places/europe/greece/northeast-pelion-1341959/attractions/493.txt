Elleniko Museum | Pelion Peninsula, Greece |  Dedicated to Rigas Feraios, a martyr of the Independence campaign, this humble museum once held a concealed classroom where a lone priest taught children in secret, out of view of the occupying Turks who banned schools of any sort among the rebellious Greeks. Exhibits include compelling photos of village life in the 1950s and 1960s.
