Kastani Beach | Skopelos, Greece |  It's easy to see the temptations of Skopelos' famous 'Mamma Mia! beach': a pine-adorned, silver-sand-and-pebble stretch at the end of a steep track 13km west of Skopelos Town, with glittering aqua-coloured water, excellent swimming and a string of sun loungers (â‚¬7). These days it's overlooked by a large beach bar (May to early October).
