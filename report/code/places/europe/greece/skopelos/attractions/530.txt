Panormos Beach | Skopelos, Greece |  Calm glass-clear water and pine-covered hills frame this gorgeous grey-pebble bay and low-key resort, 11km northwest of Agnontas and 11km west of Skopelos Town. There are several appealing tavernas here, along with sunbeds, a few hotels and apartments and possibly one of the world's most scenic bus stops.
