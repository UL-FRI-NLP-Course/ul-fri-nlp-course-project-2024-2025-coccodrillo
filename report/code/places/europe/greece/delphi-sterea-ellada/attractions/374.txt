Thiva Archaeological Museum | Central Greece, Greece |  This superb and much-expanded museum explores the rich history of Thiva, which as ancient Thebes played a major role in Greek civilisation from the Bronze-Age Mycenaean era until its destruction by Alexander the Great. Highlights include wall paintings from the cityâ€™s Mycenaean palace, and a row of kouroi (large male statues).
A 13th-century medieval stone tower stands in the museum courtyard.
