Byzantine Museum | Macedonia, Greece |  This museum in a restored mill will turn you from novice to nerd in all things Byzantine. Splendorous icons, huge 5th-century floor mosaics and ornate sarcophagi fill all three floors of the beautifully lit space. A film on the bottom floor gives the history of the mill and Veria's Barbouta quarter.
