Historic & Folklore Museum | Dodecanese, Greece |  Housed in an incongruous castellated villa on the seafront, this museum covers several aspects of local history. The upstairs rooms are given over largely to weapons, helmets and photos relating to WWII, while downstairs you’ll find displays of traditional costumes and an emotive gallery devoted to artworks created by political prisoners incarcerated on the island during the colonels’ dictatorship of the 1960s and 1970s.
