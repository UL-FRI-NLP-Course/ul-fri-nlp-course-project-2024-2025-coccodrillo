Kastrianis Monastery | Cyclades, Greece |  From Otzias, a spectacular coastal road runs for 6.5km to this clifftop, 18th-century monastery, offering extraordinary views to the surrounding islands. A peacock-blue dome caps the baby-blue church and, inside, the walls are covered with frescoes of saints.
