Cultural Village | Santorini, Greece |  In cooperation with the lauded Selene restaurant, this Pyrgos venue explores the traditional way of life in Santorini before it became a tourist mecca. Different rooms display different aspects of old Santorini, but the highlight is the gallery of photographs taken before Santorini's devastating 1956 earthquake. It's 100m from Pyrgos' central bus and carpark.
