Akrotiri Lighthouse | Santorini, Greece |  If you want to watch the greatest free show on earth (the sunset!) in seclusion, well, you're out of luck. Word is out, and you will be joined at the tip of this promontory by dozens of sunset-gazers. Still, there's plenty of room for everybody and the lighthouse lacks Oia's crowds.
