Kastro | Cyclades, Greece |  A Venetian fortress that stood here in the 13th century gave Kastro its name. Today it is a charming, lived-in place, with winding alleyways between brilliant white houses. At its heart is the main square and the Church of Pantanassa. Check out the buildings surrounding the church, which were homes to the townâ€™s wealthy merchants: two-storey affairs with remnants of ornate stonework around the windows.
