Tsougria | Skiathos, Greece |  Two honey-gold, sunbed-dotted sand beaches bordered by pines adorn this mellow island, reached by taxi boat from Skiathos Town's old port (â‚¬5, 15 minutes, hourly 10am to noon and 3pm to 5pm late May to early October). There are a couple of tavernas, or you could also pack drinks and a picnic.
