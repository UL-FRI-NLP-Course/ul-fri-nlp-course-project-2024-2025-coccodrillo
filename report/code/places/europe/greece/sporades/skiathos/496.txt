Mikros Aselinos Beach | Skiathos, Greece |  With just a handful of sun loungers and a shack-like taverna, tiny and sandy-gold rock-enclosed Mikros Aselinos rests on the northwest coast 2km north of well-known Moni Panagias Kounistras, and is accessed via an unpaved road then a steep dirt path.
It can get rough if the wind is up.
