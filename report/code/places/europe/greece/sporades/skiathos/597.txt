Ligaries Beach | Skiathos, Greece |  Backed by a sea of greenery, this golden-white sand-and-pebble north-coast strand has clear aqua water, a respectable taverna and a smattering of sun loungers. It's 7km northwest of Skiathos Town, and you'll probably need a 4WD or quad bike to drive the dirt road here.
