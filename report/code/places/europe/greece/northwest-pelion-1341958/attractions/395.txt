Byzantine Art and Culture Museum | Pelion Peninsula, Greece |  Perched immediately above the village square (and church) in a mansion that’s been given a modern, air-conditioned makeover, Makrinitsa’s ‘showroom of ecclesiastical heirlooms’ opened in 2019. The collection consists entirely of religious art and treasures from local churches and monasteries, and includes three icons by roving artist Theophilos.
