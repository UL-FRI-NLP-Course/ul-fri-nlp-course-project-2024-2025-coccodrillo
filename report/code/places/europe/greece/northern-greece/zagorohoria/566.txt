Moni Evaggelistria | Zagorohoria, Greece |  Built in 1630, this little monastery has a church that glows like a box of jewels: its vivid 18th-century frescoes have never been retouched, but simply preserved with care over the centuries. The attendant nun (who speaks French as well as Greek) will let you in, using an impressive key.
