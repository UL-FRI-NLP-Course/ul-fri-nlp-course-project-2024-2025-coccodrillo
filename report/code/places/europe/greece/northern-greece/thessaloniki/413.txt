Museum of the Macedonian Struggle | Thessaloniki, Greece |  Ground zero for Greek nationalism, this museum in a handsome late-19th-century mansion recounts how heroic Hellenes wrested Macedonia from both Turks and Bulgarians. The building, which was the Greek Consulate in Ottoman times, contains intriguing examples of obscure maps, documents, accoutrements and firearms belonging to key players in the struggle, plus photos, uniforms and more.
