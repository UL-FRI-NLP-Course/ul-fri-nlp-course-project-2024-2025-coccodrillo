Tobacco Museum | Macedonia, Greece |  This surprisingly interesting museum whirls through the history of tobacco cultivation and production in eastern Macedonia and Thrace. Bright murals, old photographs, a curious collection of pipes and a tobacco press enliven plenty of description (in Greek and English). The tang of tobacco and wood in the air adds to the ambience.
The museum stays open until 9pm on Thursdays from June to September.
