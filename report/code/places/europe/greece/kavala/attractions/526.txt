Archaeological Museum of Kavala | Macedonia, Greece |  Sculpture, jewellery, grave stelae, terracotta figurines and vases from ancient Amfipoli are found in this quiet, well-presented museum. Looted during WWII, the permanent exhibition nonetheless traces the city's turbulent transition from ancient Neapolis to Byzantine Christoupolis and finally, modern Kavala.
