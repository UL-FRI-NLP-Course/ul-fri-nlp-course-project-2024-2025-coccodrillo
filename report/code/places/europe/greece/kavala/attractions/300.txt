Panagia Quarter | Macedonia, Greece |  Named for the Panagia church, this historic peninsula's narrow, tangled streets are lined by pretty pastel houses. A calf-stiffening walk leads up to the castle, while other highlights include the restored ruby Halil Bey Mosque and Mohamed Ali House. The enormous 18-domed Imaret (1817), now a wonderful hotel, was Ottoman Pasha Mohamed Ali's hostel for Islamic theology students.
