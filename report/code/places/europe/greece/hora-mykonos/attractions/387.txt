Archaeological Museum of Mykonos | Hora (Mykonos), Greece |  A headless, almost limbless 2nd-century BC statue of Hercules in Parian marble is the highlight of this small, well-presented collection. Otherwise it's very heavy on pottery and funerary stelae (carved monuments), much of it sourced from Delos and the neighbouring island of Rineia, which served as its cemetery. Periodic exhibitions incorporate contemporary art and design into the displays.
