Moni Theotokou | Corfu, Greece |  On the headland above Paleokastritsa's western end, this Orthodox monastery dates from the 13th century, although the current buildings are more recent. An easy 10-minute walk (or even easier drive) up from the beach, it's a lovely spot, set amid colourful gardens, patrolled by contented cats and blessed with bountiful views.
