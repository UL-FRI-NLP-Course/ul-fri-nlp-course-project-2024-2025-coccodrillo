Paragaea Olive Oil Museum | Parga, Greece |  This museum in Parga's erstwhile olive-oil factory, operational from 1929 until 1974, covers the history of Parga's major pre-tourist industry (the trees have been here since the Venetians ordered them planted in the 15th century). Guided tours end with a tasting of oils. The place also offers cooking classes (€60) and wine tastings (€21).
