Waterfalls Park | Macedonia, Greece |  Located at the eastern side of town, Waterfalls Park offers several viewing points allowing you to gaze at Edessa's star attraction, and even get quite close to the thunderous flow. The larger of the two falls, Karanos, is quite impressive at 70m high. A path winds downwards to a second, smaller waterfall.
