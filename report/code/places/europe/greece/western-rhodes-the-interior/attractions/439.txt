Farma of Rhodes Petting Zoo | Rhodes, Greece |  This little farm, a couple of kilometres north of the Valley of the Butterflies, is home to some unusual residents, most notably ostriches, which respond to their own names, and visitors can feed. Fair-sized enclosures hold camels and llamas, free-ranging peacocks, ponies, donkeys and kangaroos, and there's also a kids playground, souvenir shop and a snack bar.
