Fourni Beach | Rhodes, Greece |  A precipitous paved road winds down for 5km beyond Monolithos Castle to reach Fourni Beach. A long curve of coarse, gravel-like sand, it’s often too rough for safe swimming, but it’s a delightful spot, with a seasonal taverna alongside. A short but very scenic hike leads to the tip of the sloping rocky promontory to the south.
