Temple of Apollo | Hora (Naxos), Greece |  From Naxos Town Harbour, a causeway leads to the Palatia islet and the striking, unfinished Temple of Apollo, Naxos’ most famous landmark (also known as the Portara or ‘Doorway’). Simply two marble columns with a crowning lintel, it makes an arresting sight, and people gather at sunset for splendid views.
