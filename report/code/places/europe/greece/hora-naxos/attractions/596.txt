Archaeological Museum | Hora (Naxos), Greece |  This museum in Kastro is housed in the former Jesuit school where novelist Nikos Kazantzakis was briefly a pupil. It contains fascinating finds from the Ionic and Doric eras, plus Mycenaean vases, but the most startling are the splendid Early Cycladic marble figurines.
