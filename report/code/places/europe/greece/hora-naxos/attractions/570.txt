Mitropolis Museum | Hora (Naxos), Greece |  Behind the northern end of the waterfront are several churches and chapels, as well as the Mitropolis Museum. It features fragments of a Mycenaean city (13th to 11th centuries BC) that was abandoned because of the threat of flooding. Glass panels underfoot reveal ancient foundations.
