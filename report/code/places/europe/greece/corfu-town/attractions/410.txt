Corfu Philharmonic Society | Corfu Town, Greece |  Via battered old instruments, photos and scores, this entertaining little museum tells the story of Greeceâ€™s first-ever marching band, which performed at the first modern Olympics in 1896, and still plays regularly. Founded in 1840 by Nikolaos Mantzaros, composer of the Greek national anthem, the Corfu Philharmonic Society offers free music lessons for local kids in the afternoons.
