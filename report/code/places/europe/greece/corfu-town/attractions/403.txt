Church of St George | Corfu Town, Greece |  A dazzling white edifice resembling an ancient Greek temple dominates a sweeping flat platform on the southern flanks of the Palaio Frourio. Visible from far along the coast, it's actually a church, built by the British in 1840 for the local Anglican community. Now Orthodox, it hosts just two services a year, plus occasional concerts and exhibitions.
