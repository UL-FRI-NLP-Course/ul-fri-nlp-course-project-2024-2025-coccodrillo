Solomos Museum | Corfu Town, Greece |  The former home of poet Dionysios Solomos (1798â€“1857), facing the Old Port across the waterfront road, is now a museum. His 'Hymn to Liberty' became the Greek national anthem, but with few English translations the museum's many formal portraits and leather-bound volumes may not hold your attention for long.
