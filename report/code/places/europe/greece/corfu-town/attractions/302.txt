Antivouniotissa Museum | Corfu Town, Greece |  Home to an outstanding collection of Byzantine and post-Byzantine icons and artefacts, the exquisite, timber-roofed Church of Our Lady of Antivouniotissa has a double role as church and museum. It stands atop a short, broad stairway that climbs from shore-front Arseniou, and frames views out towards wooded Vidos Island.
Belying the plain facade, the ornate and intricately decorated interior holds treasures dating from the 15th century onwards.
