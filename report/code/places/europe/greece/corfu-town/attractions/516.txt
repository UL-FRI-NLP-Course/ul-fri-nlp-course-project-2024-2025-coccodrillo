British Cemetery | Corfu Town, Greece |  A tranquil New Town spot, set amid wooded gardens filled with wildflowers, Corfuâ€™s British Cemetery can only be entered via an inconspicuous gateway on Kolokotrini. Most of those buried here are casualties of 19th- and 20th-century wars; the heaviest toll came when two British ships hit mines off Albania in 1946.
