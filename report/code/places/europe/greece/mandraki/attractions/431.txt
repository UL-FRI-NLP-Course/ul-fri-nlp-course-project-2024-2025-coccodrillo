Church Museum | Dodecanese, Greece |  Despite its name, this small museum, just up from the seafront below the monastery, is exclusively ecclesiastic. Besides its icons, vestments, votive offerings and memorabilia of long-deceased monks, itâ€™s crammed with oddments ranging from coins and banknotes (money given to the church, including in foreign currency) to dolls used to celebrate baptisms and weddings.
