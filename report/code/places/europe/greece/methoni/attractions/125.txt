Kastro | Messinia, Greece |  This vast, crumbling kastro, a great example of 15th-century Venetian military architecture, is built on a promontory south of Methoni. It's surrounded on three sides by the sea and separated from the mainland by a dry moat. Enter the inner keep through the mighty gateway to discover a Turkish bath, a cathedral, a house, a cistern and underground passages. A short causeway leads from the fortress to the diminutive octagonal Bourtzi fortress on an adjacent islet.
The medieval port town, which was located within the fortress walls, was the Venetiansâ€™ first and longest-held possession in the Peloponnese. It was also a stopover for pilgrims en route to the Holy Land.
