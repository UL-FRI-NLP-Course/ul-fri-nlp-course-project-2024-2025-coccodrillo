Folklore Museum of Chrisso | Delphi, Greece |  An imposing mansion and former school in the traditional village of Chrisso, 6km southwest of Delphi by road, now holds an enjoyable museum of local life. Fronted by colourful citrus trees, it shows off 19th-century costumes including a man's skirt with 400 pleats to symbolise 400 years of Ottoman rule, along with jewellery, pistols, paintings and photographs.
