Museum | Dodecanese, Greece |  This small museum's key collection is the fossil remains of some of the island's ancient population of dwarf elephants. At the time of research, the collection was being moved to new, modern premises by Harkadio Cave, several kilometres southeast of Megalo Horio, where the actual bones were discovered.
