Moni Megistis Lavras | Macedonia, Greece |  Pre-eminent amongst Athos' monasteries, this magnificent 10th-century complex is the peninsula's largest; it houses founder St Athanasios' tomb, and a precious collection of manuscripts, icons and other treasures. From here, a small boat sometimes serves the hospitable west-coast Agias Annis Skiti.
