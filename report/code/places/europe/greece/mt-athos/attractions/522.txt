Moni Dochiariou | Macedonia, Greece |  One of the most elegant and revered monasteries on Athos, 10th-century Dochiariou boasts beautiful buildings, frescoes from the 16th- to the 18th-centuries, and more than 900 rare manuscripts. It's a pleasant 15-minute scramble from Moni Xenofondos: both are scheduled stops for the slow ferries to Ouranoupoli.
