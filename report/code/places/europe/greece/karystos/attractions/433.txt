Roman Quarry | Evia, Greece |  A 3km, one-hour walk signposted from upper Myli (4km north of Karystos) leads northeast to an abandoned Roman quarry (Kylindroi, meaning 'cylinder'), strewn with massive marble columns and developed between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD.
Finds from the quarry are on display at Karystos' Archaeological Museum.
