Neratzes Mosque | Rethymno, Greece |  This triple-domed mosque began life as an Augustinian church and was converted by the Turks in 1657, although the recently restored minaret wasn't added until 1890. Today the building is a music conservatory and performance space, with events held most Friday and Saturday evenings.
