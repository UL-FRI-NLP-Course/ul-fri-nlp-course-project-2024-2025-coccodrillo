Museum of Contemporary Art | Rethymno, Greece |  The cornerstone of the permanent collection of this well-curated modern-art museum, founded in 1992, is the oils, drawings and watercolours of local lad Lefteris Kanakakis, but over time it has amassed enough works to present the arc of creative endeavour in Greece since the 1950s. Temporary exhibits keep things dynamic. Entrance is off Mesologhiou.
