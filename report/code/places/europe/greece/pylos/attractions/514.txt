René Puaux Exhibition | Messinia, Greece |  Housed in a red mansion on the seafront, this collection of pictures depicts the War of Independence with a focus on the Battle of Navarino. It was donated by René Puaux (1878–1937), who bequeathed porcelain, engravings and lithographs on the condition that they be exhibited at Pylos, near the battle’s location.
