Museum of Greek Revolution | Central Greece, Greece |  The former home of Dimitrios Panourgias, a hero of the 19th-century struggle for Greek independence, opened in 2019 as a museum of the revolution. In the upstairs galleries is a blow-by-blow account of the local battles; it's complemented by displays of fearsome weaponry in the basement.
