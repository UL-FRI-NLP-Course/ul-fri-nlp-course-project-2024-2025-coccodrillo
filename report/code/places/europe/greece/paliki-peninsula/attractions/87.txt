Petani Beach | Kefallonia, Greece |  The highlight of the Paliki Peninsula is breathtaking Petani Beach, a spectacular strand of white sand and pebble thatâ€™s enough to entice a jaded mermaid. In fact, it's so blissful that it's fair to call it one of the best beaches in all of Greece. Although it gets busy in summer, development remains happily minimal. Walk to the far-northern end for a little peace in high season.
