Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova | Turku, Finland |  Art and archaeology unite here under one roof. Aboa Vetus (Old Turku) draws you underground to Turkuâ€™s medieval streets, showcasing some of the 37,000 artefacts unearthed from the site (digs still continue). Back in the present, Ars Nova has contemporary-art exhibitions upstairs. English-language tours lasting 45 minutes (included in admission) take place daily from 11.30am in July and August.
The themed Turku Biennaali (www.turkubiennaali.fi) takes place here in the summer of odd-numbered years.
