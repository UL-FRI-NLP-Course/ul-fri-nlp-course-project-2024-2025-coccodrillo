Sibelius Museum | Turku, Finland |  Finland's most extensive musical museum displays some 350 instruments from accordions to Zimbabwean drums. A separate section is devoted to Finnish composer and bohemian carouser Jean Sibelius, with manuscripts and personal memorabilia. You can listen to Sibeliusâ€™ music on scratchy records, or hear live jazz, folk and chamber music at Wednesday-evening concerts held from autumn to spring. The museum is housed in a very cool, contemporary building by Woldemar Baeckman.
