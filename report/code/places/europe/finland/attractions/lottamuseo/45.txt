Lottamuseo | Finland, Europe |  This striking blue Tuusulanjärvi building commemorates the Lotta women’s voluntary defence force, established in 1921 after the independence of Finland. Named for a character in a JL Runeberg poem, these unarmed women took on military service during WWII to become one of the world’s largest auxiliaries. Look out among the military paraphernalia for the blue-and-white crux gammata and heraldic silver rose medals, which many Lottas wore. From Kamppi bus station, take a Mäntsälä-bound bus (weekdays only) to the Onnela stop.
