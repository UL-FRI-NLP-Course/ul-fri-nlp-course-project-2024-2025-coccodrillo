Finlayson Centre | Tampere, Finland |  Tampere’s industrial era began with Scot James Finlayson, who established a cotton mill by the Tammerkoski in the 1820s. Later it grew massively and was the first building in the Nordic countries to have electric lighting, which started operating in 1882. It has now been sensitively converted into a mall of cafes and shops; you’ll also find a cinema, brewery pub and a couple of intriguing museums here.
