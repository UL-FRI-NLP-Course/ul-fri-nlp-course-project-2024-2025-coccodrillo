Werstas | Tampere, Finland |  This worthwhile labour museum has a variety of changing exhibitions covering social history and labour industries. The permanent exhibition consists of three parts: a reconstruction of various historically typical Finnish workplaces â€“ a shop and printing press; an in-depth focus on textiles; and a hall holding the enormous steam engine and wheel that powered the Finlayson factory in the 19th century.
