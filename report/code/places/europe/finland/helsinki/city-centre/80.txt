Johan Ludvig Runeberg Statue | Helsinki, Finland |  Finland's national poet and composer of the Finnish national anthem, Johan Ludvig Runeberg, is commemorated by a statue in the city's central Esplanadin Puisto. It was unveiled in 1885. Interestingly, Runeberg's name does not appear on the memorial as it was considered self-evident when it was installed.
