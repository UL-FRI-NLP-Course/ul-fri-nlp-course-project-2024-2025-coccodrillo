Ruiskumestarin talo | Helsinki, Finland |  Mustard-coloured Ruiskumestarin talo is central Helsinkiâ€™s oldest wooden townhouse, built in 1818. The charming cottage, with hardwood floors, fireplaces and printed wallpaper, has been furnished as it would have been when it was the home of the middle-class Wickholm family, who owned the property from 1859 to 1896, with day-to-day items such as a butter churn.
