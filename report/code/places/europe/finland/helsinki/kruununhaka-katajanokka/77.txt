Senaatintori | Helsinki, Finland |  From the kauppatori walk up the cobbled Sofiankatu to Senaatintori, Helsinki's majestic central square. Surrounded by early 19th-century buildings, the square was modelled after St Petersburg's. CL Engel's stately Tuomiokirkko, finished in 1852, is the square's most prominent feature and the steps are a favourite meeting place.
