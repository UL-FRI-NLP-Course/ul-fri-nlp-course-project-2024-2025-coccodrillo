Espoo Museum of Modern Art | Helsinki, Finland |  In the commuter city of Espoo, this museum has a huge collection of mostly Finnish modern art, ranging from the early 20th century to the present. Works by acclaimed ceramicist Rut Bryk (1916â€“99) are a highlight. Sharing the same address and opening hours, and visitable with the same ticket, other museums on site (covering Espoo city, toys and horology) can round out a day trip. From Kamppi bus station, take bus 106 or 110 to the WeeGee-Talo stop.
Many performances during the April Jazz Festival are held here.
