Vesikko | Helsinki, Finland |  At Suomenlinna, the Vesikko is the only WWII-era submarine remaining in Finland (the rest were scrapped). It saw action against the Russians during the Finnish Winter War and the Continuation Wars, and was responsible for sinking the Russian merchant ship Vyborg. Itâ€™s fascinating to climb inside the cramped space and see how it all worked, accompanied by sound effects, including crew commands, running machinery and a torpedo attack.
