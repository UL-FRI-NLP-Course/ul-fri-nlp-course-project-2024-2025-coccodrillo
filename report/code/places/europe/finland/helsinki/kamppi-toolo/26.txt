Tennispalatsi | Helsinki, Finland |  The 1938-completed Tennispalatsi (Tennis Palace) cultural and recreation centre was intended for the 1940 Summer Olympics, which were subsequently cancelled following the outbreak of WWII, although it went on to host basketball games during Helsinki's successful 1952 Summer Olympics. Today the building houses the superb Helsinki Art Museum and other venues, including a cinema and shops.
