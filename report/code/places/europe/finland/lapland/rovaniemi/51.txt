Santa's Grotto | Rovaniemi, Finland |  Santa sees visitors year-round in this impressive grotto, with a huge clock mechanism (it slows the earth’s rotation so that Santa can visit the whole world’s children on Christmas Eve). The portly saint is quite a linguist, and an old hand at chatting with kids and adults alike.
A private chat (around two minutes) is absolutely free, but you can’t photograph the moment, and official photos of your visit start at €25. You can also get a certificate of 'niceness' or of meeting Santa (each €10).
