You can also visit a husky park, and view ice sculpting and varying Christmassy exhibitions. There are Christmas-themed dining options; on-site accommodation includes cabins at Santa Claus Holiday Village, and the new Snowman World (http://snowmanworld.fi), with glass-sided apartments and a winter-only ice hotel complete with restaurant and bar.Bus 8 heads here from the train station, via the city and airport (€4.25, 25 minutes, up to three hourly 6.30am to 6.30pm).
