Serlachius Museum Gustaf | Finland, Europe |  In the town centre, this elegant white 1930s modernist mansion was formerly the company HQ of the Serlachius family. Now a museum, it hosts a comprehensive display on the history of the paperworks and family, with audio exhibits on every conceivable aspect: youâ€™d be here a week listening to them all. The attractive building also has two to three reliably excellent temporary exhibitions.
