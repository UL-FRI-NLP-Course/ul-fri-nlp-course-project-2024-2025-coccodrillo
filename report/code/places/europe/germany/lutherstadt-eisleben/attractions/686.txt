Luther's Sterbehaus | Central Germany, Germany |  This museum, expanded and updated in 2013, focuses on three themes: how the culture of death has evolved over the centuries; Eisleben native son Martin Luther's thoughts about death; and the last 24 hours of the religious reformer's life. The museum's prize literary exhibit is a Bible from 1541 â€“ the last Luther worked on before his death here in 1546.
