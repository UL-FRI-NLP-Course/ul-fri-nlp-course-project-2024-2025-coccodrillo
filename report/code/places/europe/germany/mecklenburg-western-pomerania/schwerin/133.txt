Galerie Alte & Neue Meister | Northern Germany, Germany |  Revel in the Flemish masterpieces collected by the Mecklenburg dukes during the 17th and 18th centuries at this impressive museum with wide-ranging collections. Works include oils by Lucas Cranach the Elder, as well as paintings by Brueghel, Rembrandt and Rubens. The 15 statues in the Ernst Barlach room provide a small taste of the sculptor’s work. There’s a typically amusing and irreverent Marcel Duchamp collection.
