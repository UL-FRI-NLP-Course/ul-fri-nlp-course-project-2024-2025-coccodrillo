Aussichtsturm Adlerhorst | Rügen Island, Germany |  Northwest of Binz, in a lovely Rügen forest, the extraordinary spiral Aussichtsturm Adlerhorst rises 30m above the forest floor – the spiral ramp goes round and around for 600m. It's a wonderful experience and the views out over the treetops are stunning.
