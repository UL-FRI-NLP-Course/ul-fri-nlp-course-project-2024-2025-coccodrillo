Albertinum | Dresden, Germany |  The Renaissance-era former arsenal is the stunning home of the Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery), which displays an array of paintings by some of the great names in art from the 18th century onwards. Caspar David Friedrich and Claude Monet's landscapes compete with the abstract visions of Marc Chagall and Gerhard Richter, all in gorgeous rooms orbiting a light-filled courtyard. There's also a superb sculpture collection spread over the lower floors.
Less damaged in the allied bombing of 1945, the Albertinum served as the museum of museums after World War II, housing the main Dresden art collections until they could be moved to restored premises.
