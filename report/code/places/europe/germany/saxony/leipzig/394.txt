Zeitgeschichtliches Forum | Leipzig, Germany |  This fascinating, enormous and well-curated exhibit covers the political history of the GDR, from division and dictatorship to fall-of-the-Wall ecstasy and post-Wende blues. It's essential viewing for anyone seeking to understand the late country's political power apparatus, the systematic oppression of regime critics, milestones in inter-German and international relations, and the opposition movement that led to its downfall.
The permanent exhibition was closed for reconstruction at the time of research and due to reopen in 2019.
