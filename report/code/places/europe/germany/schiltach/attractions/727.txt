Museum am Markt | The Black Forest, Germany |  Museum am Markt is crammed with everything from antique spinning wheels to Biedermeier costumes. Highlights include the cobblerâ€™s workshop and an interactive display recounting the tale of the devilish Teufel von Schiltach, who, as local lore has it, was responsible for the raging fire that reduced the town to ashes in the 16th century.
