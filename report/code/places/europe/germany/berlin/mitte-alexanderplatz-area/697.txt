Friedhof Grosse Hamburger Strasse | Berlin, Germany |  What looks like a small park was in fact Berlinâ€™s first Jewish cemetery, destroyed by the Nazis in 1943. Some 2700 people were buried here between 1672 and 1827, including the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. A symbolic tombstone in his honour and a sarcophagus filled with destroyed gravestones stands representative for all the 6ft-under residents.
