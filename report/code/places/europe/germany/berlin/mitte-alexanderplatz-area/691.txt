Sammlung Hoffmann | Berlin, Germany |  Blink and you’ll miss the doorway leading to the Sophie-Gips-Höfe, a trio of courtyards linking Sophienstrasse and Gipsstrasse. The former sewing-machine factory now harbours shops, offices and flats as well as this stellar contemporary art collection in a private home, which is open for guided 90-minute tours every Saturday. Registration required.
