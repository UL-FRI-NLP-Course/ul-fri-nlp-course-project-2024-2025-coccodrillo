Marlene Dietrich Grave | Berlin, Germany |  Germany's first actress to hit the big time in Hollywood, Marlene Dietrich was born in Schöneberg in 1901. In 1992 the 'Blue Angel' moved into her final home in a humble plot on a tiny cemetary prosaically called Städtischer Friedhof III. She's buried in section 34 – look for the map inside the cemetery entrance to locate the grave.
In 2004 avant-garde fashion photographer Helmut Newton was buried four plots away from the grand dame.
