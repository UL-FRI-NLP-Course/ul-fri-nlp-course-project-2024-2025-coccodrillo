Jugendfarm Moritzhof | Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin |  This educational farm playground for kids offers interaction with barnyard animals and courses in basket-weaving, forging, felting and other old-timey crafts. Ponies, rabbits, goats, a pig and other animals get fed at 5pm daily.
The educational farm is part of the northern Mauerpark and thus on ground once occupied by the Berlin Wall.
