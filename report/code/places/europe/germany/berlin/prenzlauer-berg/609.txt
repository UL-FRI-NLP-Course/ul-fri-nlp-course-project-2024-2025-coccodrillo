Kollwitzplatz | Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin |  Triangular Kollwitzplatz was ground zero of Prenzlauer Berg gentrification. To pick up on the local vibe, linger with macchiato mamas and media daddies in a street cafe or join them at the twice-weekly farmers market. The park in the square's centre is tot heaven with three playgrounds plus a bronze sculpture of the artist KÃ¤the Kollwitz for clambering on.
