Gethsemanekirche | Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin |  This 1893 neo-Gothic church was a hotbed of dissent in the final days of the GDR and thus a thorn in the side of the Stasi, which, as late as October 1989, brutally quashed a peaceful gathering outside its portals. Artworks include a copy of Ernst Barlach's Geistk√§mpfer (Ghost Fighter, 1928) sculpture outside the church, which also hosts concerts and other cultural events in addition to Sunday service at 11am.
