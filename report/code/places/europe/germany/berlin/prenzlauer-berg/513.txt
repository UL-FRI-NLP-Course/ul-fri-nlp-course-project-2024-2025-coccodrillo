Tchoban Foundation – Museum für Architekturzeichnung | Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin |  Fans of edgy contemporary architecture should swing by this private museum housed in a striking sculptural pile of relief-decorated concrete cubes topped by a glass penthouse. Changing exhibits showcase architectural drawings from the private collection of museum founder Sergei Tchoban or from such major repositories as Vienna's Albertina or London's Sir John Soane's Museum.
Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson has his studio next door.
