Kunstgewerbemuseum | Berlin, Germany |  This prized collection of European design, fashion and decorative arts from the Middle Ages to today is part of the Kulturforum museum cluster. You can feast your eyes on exquisitely ornate medieval reliquaries and portable altars or compare Bauhaus classics to contemporary designs by Philippe Starck and Ettore Sottsass. Pride of place goes to the Fashion Gallery with classic designer outfits and accessories from the past 150 years.
