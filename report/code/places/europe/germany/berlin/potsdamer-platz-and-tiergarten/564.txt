Diplomatenviertel | Berlin, Germany |  In the 1920s, a quiet villa-studded colony south of the Tiergarten evolved into Berlin's embassy quarter. After WWII the obliterated area remained in a state of quiet decay while the embassies all set up in the West German capital of Bonn. After reunification, many countries rebuilt on their historic lots, accounting for some of Berlinâ€™s boldest new architecture, which can be nicely explored on a leisurely wander.
