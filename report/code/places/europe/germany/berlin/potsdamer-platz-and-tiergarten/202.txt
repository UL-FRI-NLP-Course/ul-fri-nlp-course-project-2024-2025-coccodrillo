Panoramapunkt | Berlin, Germany |  Europeâ€™s fastest lift, Panoramapunkt yo-yos up and down the red-brick postmodern Kollhoff Tower in 20 seconds. From the bilevel viewing platform at a lofty 100m, you can pinpoint the sights, make a java stop in the 1930s-style cafe, enjoy sunset from the terrace and check out the exhibit that peels back the layers of the square's history.
Last entry to the tower is 30 minutes before closing time; the cafe opens at 11am and closes one hour before the tower.
