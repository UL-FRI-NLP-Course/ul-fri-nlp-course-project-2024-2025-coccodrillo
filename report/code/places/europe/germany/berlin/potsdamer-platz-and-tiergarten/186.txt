Martin-Gropius-Bau | Berlin, Germany |  With its mosaics, terracotta reliefs and airy atrium, this Italian Renaissanceâ€“style exhibit space named for its architect (Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius' great-uncle) is a celebrated venue for high-calibre art and cultural exhibits. Whether it's a David Bowie retrospective, the latest works of Ai Weiwei or an ethnological exhibit on the mysteries of Angkor Wat, it's bound to be well curated and utterly fascinating.
The Berlin state parliament convenes in the stately neo-Renaissance structure (the Abgeordnetenhaus) across the street.
