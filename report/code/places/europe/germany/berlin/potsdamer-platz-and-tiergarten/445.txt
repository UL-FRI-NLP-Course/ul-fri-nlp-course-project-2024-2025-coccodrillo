Gedenkstätte Stille Helden | Berlin, Germany |  The Silent Heroes Memorial Center is dedicated to ordinary Germans who found the courage to help their persecuted Jewish neighbours through such actions as providing food, hiding people or obtaining fake ID cards. Using documents, photographs and objects, the exhibit illustrates 10 case studies of both successful and failed rescue attempts.
It's in the same building as the Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand, another excellent and free exhibit.
