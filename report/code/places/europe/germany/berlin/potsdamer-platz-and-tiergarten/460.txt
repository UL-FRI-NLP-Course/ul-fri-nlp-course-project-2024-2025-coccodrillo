Weinhaus Huth | Berlin, Germany |  This rare eyewitness to the pre-WWII Potsdamer Platz was designed in 1912 as a wine restaurant. It was one of the first steel-frame buildings in town. The sturdy construction allowed the owners to store the heavy wine on the upper floors and helped it withstand the wartime bombing raids.
Today's there's again a wine tavern on the ground floor while the free Daimler Contemporary Berlin gallery presents edgy art exhibits on the 4th.
