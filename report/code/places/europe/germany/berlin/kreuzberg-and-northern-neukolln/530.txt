FHXB Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Museum | Kreuzberg, Berlin |  The ups and downs of one of Berlin’s most colourful districts – Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain – are chronicled in this converted red-brick factory. The permanent exhibit, which zeros in on Kreuzberg’s radical legacy, is complemented by changing presentations that often examine such hot-button issues as immigration or gentrification.
The 1928 printing press on the mezzanine level is still cranked into action on occasion.
