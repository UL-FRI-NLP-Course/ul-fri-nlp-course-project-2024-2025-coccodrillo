Berlinische Galerie | Kreuzberg, Berlin |  This gallery in a converted glass warehouse is a superb spot for taking stock of Berlinâ€™s art scene since 1870. Temporary exhibits occupy the ground floor, from where two floating staircases lead upstairs to selections from the permanent collection, which is especially strong when it comes to Dada, New Objectivity, Eastern European avant-garde, and art created since reunification in 1990.
