Molecule Man | Kreuzberg, Berlin |  Right in the Spree River, near the Elsenbr√ºcke bridge, this giant aluminium sculpture shows three bodies embracing and is meant to symbolise the joining of the three districts of Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain and Treptow across the former watery border. The 30m-high work was designed by the American artist Jonathan Borofsky.
