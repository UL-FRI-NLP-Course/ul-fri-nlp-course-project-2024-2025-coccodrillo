Transit Mural | Kreuzberg, Berlin |  This five-storey-tall street mural by Belgian artist ROA depicts animal carcasses, including a sheep and a deer, in a distinctive monochrome spray-paint style. Depicting the cycle of life and death of animals native to the region where the work is created is a recurrent theme in ROA's work.
