Das Verborgene Museum | City West & Charlottenburg, Berlin |  Instigated in 1986 by a feminist artist and an art historian, this pint-size nonprofit museum has a unique focus: to exhibit the works of women artists who, for various reasons, have fallen into obscurity or never received the recognition and exposure they deserved. Most belong to the generation born around 1900. Curators mount about two exhibitions annually, which run for three or four months each. At other times, the museum is closed.
