Schlossgarten Charlottenburg | City West & Charlottenburg, Berlin |  The expansive park behind Schloss Charlottenburg is part formal French, part unruly English and all picturesque playground. Hidden among the shady paths, flower beds, lawns, mature trees and carp pond are two smaller royal buildings, the sombre Mausoleum and the dainty Belvedere. Itâ€™s a lovely place for strolling, jogging or lazing on a sunny day.
