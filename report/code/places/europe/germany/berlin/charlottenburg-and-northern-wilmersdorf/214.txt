Schloss Charlottenburg - Mausoleum | City West & Charlottenburg, Berlin |  In the palace garden, west of the carp pond, the temple-like Mausoleum (1810) was conceived as the final resting place of Queen Luise, and twice expanded to make room for other royals, including Luiseâ€™s husband Friedrich Wilhelm III and Kaiser Wilhelm I and his wife Augusta. Their ornate marble sarcophagi are exquisitely sculpted works of art. More royals are buried in the crypt (closed to the public).
