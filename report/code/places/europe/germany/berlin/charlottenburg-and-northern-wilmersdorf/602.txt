Story of Berlin | City West & Charlottenburg, Berlin |  This engaging museum breaks 800 years of Berlin history into bite-size chunks that are easy to swallow but substantial enough to be satisfying. Each room uses sound, light, technology and original objects to zero in on a specific theme or epoch in the city's history. Tickets include a 45-minute tour (in English) of a 1970s atomic bomb shelter.
The museum is currently closed for construction.
