Schloss Charlottenburg - Neuer Pavillon | City West & Charlottenburg, Berlin |  Returning from a trip to Italy, Friedrich Wilhelm III (r 1797â€“1848) commissioned Karl Friedrich Schinkel to design this petite summer refuge modelled on a villa in Naples. Today, the minipalace is a stylish backdrop for masterpieces by Schinkel and his contemporaries, including the painters Caspar David Friedrich and Eduard Gaertner and the sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch. The ground-floor rooms brim with Biedermeier furniture.
