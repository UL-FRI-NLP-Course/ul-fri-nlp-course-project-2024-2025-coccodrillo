Weltbrunnen | City West & Charlottenburg, Berlin |  Everyone from foot-sore tourists to buskers and skateboarding teens gathers around the quirky Weltbrunnen, a 1983 creation of local artist Joachim Schmettau. Nicknamed Wasserklops (water meatball), it's made from red granite and bronze, and festooned with sculptures of humans and animals.
