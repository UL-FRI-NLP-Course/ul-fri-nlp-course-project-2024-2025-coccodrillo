Universum Science Centre | Bremen City, Germany |  Bremen has a strong aerospace industry, and space buffs will enjoy the eye-catching, oyster-shaped Universum Science Centre, where you can make virtual trips to the stars, as well as to the ocean floor or the centre of the earth. Previous exhibits focused on astronomy and exploration, with a special display on women astronauts. Great for kids.
