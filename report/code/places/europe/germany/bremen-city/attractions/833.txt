Schnoor | Bremen City, Germany |  This maze of narrow, winding alleys was once the fishermen's quarter and later a red-light district. Now its doll's-house-sized cottages contain boutiques, restaurants, cafes and galleries. Though mainly geared to tourists, it has some lovely corners to explore on a leisurely ramble.
