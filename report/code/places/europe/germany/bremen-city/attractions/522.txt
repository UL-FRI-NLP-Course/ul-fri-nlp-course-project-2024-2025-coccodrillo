Bleikeller | Bremen City, Germany |  Located inside Dom St Petri, but accessed via a separate entrance south of the main door, the Lead Cellar was formerly the cathedralâ€™s cellar and today is a crypt, housing eight preserved corpses that mummified in the cathedral crypt's dry air. They include a Swedish countess, a soldier with his mouth opened in a silent scream and a student who died in a duel in 1705. It's more than a little creepy.
