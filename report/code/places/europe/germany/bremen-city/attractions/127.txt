BÃ¶ttcherstrasse | Bremen City, Germany |  The charming medieval coopers lane was transformed into a prime example of mostly expressionist architecture in the 1920s at the instigation of coffee merchant Ludwig Roselius. Its red-brick houses sport unique facades, whimsical fountains, statues and a carillon; many house artisanal shops and art museums. Its most striking feature is Bernhard Hoetger's golden Lichtbringer relief (Bringer of Light), which keeps an eye on the north entrance.
