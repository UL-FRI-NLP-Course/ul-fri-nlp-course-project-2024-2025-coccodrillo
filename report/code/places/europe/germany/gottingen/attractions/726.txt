Altes Rathaus | Fairy-Tale Road, Germany |  Built in 1270, the Old Town Hall once housed the merchantsâ€™ guild. Inside, later decorations added to its Great Hall include frescos of the coats of arms of the Hanseatic cities and local bigwigs, grafted onto historic scenes. It's particularly lovely at dusk, and during special events and exhibitions (which may alter its opening hours).
