Gänseliesel | Fairy-Tale Road, Germany |  The Gänseliesel (little goose girl) statue, the symbol of the city, is hailed locally as the most kissed woman in the world – after graduating, doctoral students climb up to peck her on the cheek. The original statue, subject to vandalism, is kept in the Städtisches Museum.
