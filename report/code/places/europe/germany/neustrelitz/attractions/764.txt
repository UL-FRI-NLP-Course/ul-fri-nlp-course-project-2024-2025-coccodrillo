Schlosskirche | Northern Germany, Germany |  The palace may have gone but inhabiting its expansive gardens is the postcard-pretty, Neo-Gothic Scholsskirche, which was built in the mid-19th century. No longer used as a church, its pleasing whitewashed interior with elegant balconies is used for art exhibitions. Ask at the tourist office for current opening hours.
