Altes Rathaus | Lake Constance, Germany |  Lindauâ€™s biggest architectural stunner is the step-gabled Altes Rathaus, built in 1422 in flamboyant Gothic style. Decorated many centuries later in 1930, its facade is a frescoed frenzy of cherubs, merry minstrels, galleons, fishermen, farmers and sea monsters.
