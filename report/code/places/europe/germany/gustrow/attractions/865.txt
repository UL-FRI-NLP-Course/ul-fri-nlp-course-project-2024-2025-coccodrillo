GÃ¼strow Dom | Northern Germany, Germany |  Built between 1226 and 1335, the richly ornamented Gothic Dom contains a copy of Ernst Barlach's Hovering Angel, a memorial for the fallen soldiers of WWI; this copy was made secretly from the original mould after the Nazis destroyed the original sculpture.
