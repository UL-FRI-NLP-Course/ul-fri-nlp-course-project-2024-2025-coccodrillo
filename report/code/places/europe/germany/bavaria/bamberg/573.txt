Neue Residenz | Bamberg, Germany |  This splendid episcopal palace gives you an eyeful of the lavish lifestyle of Bambergâ€™s prince-bishops who, between 1703 and 1802, occupied its 40-odd rooms that can only be seen on guided 45-minute tours (in German). Tickets are also good for the Bavarian State Gallery, with works by Lucas Cranach the Elder and other Old Masters. The baroque Rose Garden delivers fabulous views over the town.
