Alte Kapelle | Regensburg, Germany |  South of the Dom, the humble exterior of the graceful Alte Kapelle belies the stunning interior with its rich rococo decorations. The core of the church, however, is about 1000 years old, although the vaulted ceilings were added in the Gothic period. The church is open only during services but you can always peek through the wrought-iron grill.
