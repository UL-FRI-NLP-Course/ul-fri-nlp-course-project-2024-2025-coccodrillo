Golf Museum | Regensburg, Germany |  Claiming to be Europe's best golf museum (not counting Scotland, home to the British Golf Museum), this fine repository of wooden clubs, ivory tees and yellowing score cards (including one belonging to King George V of England) backswings its way through golf's illustrious past â€“ interesting, even if you think a green fee is something to do with municipal recycling. The entrance is in an antiques shop.
