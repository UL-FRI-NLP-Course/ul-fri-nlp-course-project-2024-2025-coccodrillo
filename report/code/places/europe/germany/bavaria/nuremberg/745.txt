Schöner Brunnen | Nuremberg, Germany |  Standing like a space probe on the northwestern corner of the square is the 19m (62ft) Schöner Brunnen. A replica of the late 14th-century original, it is a stunning golden vision of 40 electors, religious heroes and other allegorical figures. The original, made of badly eroded sandstone, stands in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum.
