Neues Museum | Nuremberg, Germany |  The aptly named New Museum showcases contemporary art and design from the 1950s onwards, with resident collections of paintings, sculpture, photography and video art complemented by world-class travelling shows. Equally stunning is the award-winning building itself, with a dramatic 100m curved glass facade that, literally and figuratively, reflects the stone town wall opposite.
