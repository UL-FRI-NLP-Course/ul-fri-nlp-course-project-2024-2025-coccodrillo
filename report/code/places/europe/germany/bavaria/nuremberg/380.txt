Lorenzkirche | Nuremberg, Germany |  Dark and atmospheric, the Lorenzkirche has dramatically downlit pillars, taupe stone columns, sooty ceilings and many artistic highlights. Check out the 15th-century tabernacle in the left aisle â€“ the delicate carved strands wind up to the vaulted ceiling. Remarkable also are the stained glass (including a rose window 9m in diameter) and Veit Stoss' Engelsgruss (Annunciation), a wooden carving with life-size figures suspended above the high altar. Some of the free German-language tours climb the tower, normally out of bounds to visitors.
