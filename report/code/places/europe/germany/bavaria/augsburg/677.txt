Rathaus | Augsburg, Germany |  Rising above the Rathausplatz are the twin onion-domed spires of the Renaissance Rathaus, built by Elias Holl from 1615 to 1620 and crowned by a 4m-tall pinecone, the city's emblem (also an ancient fertility symbol). Upstairs is the Goldener Saal, a huge banquet hall with an amazing gilded and frescoed coffered ceiling.
