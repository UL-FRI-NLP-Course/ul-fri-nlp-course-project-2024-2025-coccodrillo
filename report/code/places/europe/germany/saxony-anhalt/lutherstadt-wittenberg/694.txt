Cranach-Höfe | Central Germany, Germany |  The former residence and workplace of Lucas Cranach, considered to be among the most prolific German painters and printmakers of the Reformation, have been rebooted as a beautifully restored cultural complex built around two courtyards that often echo with music and readings. There’s a permanent exhibit on the man, his life and his contemporaries.
