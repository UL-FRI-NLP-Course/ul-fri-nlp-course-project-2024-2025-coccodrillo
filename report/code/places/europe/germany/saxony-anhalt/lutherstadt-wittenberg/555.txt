Melanchthon Haus | Central Germany, Germany |  This museum, expanded in 2013, occupies the former quarters of Philipp Melanchthon, an expert in ancient languages who helped Martin Luther translate the Bible into German from Greek and Hebrew, becoming the preacher’s friend and most eloquent advocate. The historic wing authentically re-creates the atmosphere in which Melanchthon lived. The modern annex houses an exhibition on Melanchthon’s life, work and influence.
