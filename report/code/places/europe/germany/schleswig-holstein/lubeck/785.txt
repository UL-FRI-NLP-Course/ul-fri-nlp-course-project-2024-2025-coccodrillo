Salzspeicher | Lübeck, Germany |  Just behind the Holstentor (to the east) stand the Salzspeicher: six gabled brick shop-filled buildings once used to store salt transported from Lüneburg. The stuff was then bartered for furs from Scandinavia and used to preserve the herrings that formed a substantial chunk of Lübeck’s Hanseatic trade.
