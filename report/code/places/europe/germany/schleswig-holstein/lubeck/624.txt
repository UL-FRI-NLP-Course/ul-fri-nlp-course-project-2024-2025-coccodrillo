Katharinenkirche | LÃ¼beck, Germany |  Art lovers will enjoy the Katharinenkirche for its sculptures by Ernst Barlach and Gerhard Marcks, plus The Resurrection of Lazarus by Tintoretto. It has no tower, owing to the rules of the Cistercian order that built it in the 14th century. It's worth wandering the arched hallway beneath the balcony and sitting to appreciate the rich decoration, some of it recently restored.
