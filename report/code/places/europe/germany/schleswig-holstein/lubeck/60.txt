Europäisches Hansemuseum | Lübeck, Germany |  Opened in 2015, this brilliant museum tells the remarkable story of the Hanseatic League, Lübeck and the region. For 600 years, city states in northern Europe and along the Baltic discovered that shared interests in trade made everybody's life better than war. Transfixing exhibits use every modern technology to tell a story as dramatic as anything on Game of Thrones. The complex includes the beautifully restored medieval Castle Friary.
