Baakenpark | Hamburg, Germany |  Opened in May 2018, Baakenpark, on the southeastern reaches of HafenCity, is proof that the HafenCity development hasn't forgotten the need for parks. With kids playgrounds, weekend concerts and even an occasional open-air cinema, it's a lovely place to escape the rigours of city life.
