Museum für Völkerkunde | Hamburg, Germany |  North of the Altstadt, the much-updated Museum für Völkerkunde demonstrates seafaring Hamburg’s acute awareness of the outside world. Modern artefacts from Africa, Asia and the South Pacific are displayed alongside traditional masks, jewellery, costumes and musical instruments. There are also carved wooden canoes and giant sculptures from Papua New Guinea, and a complete, intricately carved Maori meeting hall.
