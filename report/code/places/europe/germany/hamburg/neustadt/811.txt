Johannes Brahms Museum | Hamburg, Germany |  Master composer Johannes Brahms (1833-1897) was born in Hamburg. Although the house where he was born was destroyed in 1943, this fine 18th-century building is an excellent substitute. All manner of original Brahms memorabilia is on display and there's a CD library with all of Brahms' works.
