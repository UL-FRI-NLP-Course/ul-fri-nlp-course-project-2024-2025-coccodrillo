Stadtkirche | Northern Germany, Germany |  The striking Stadtkirche, built in the 18th century in a neoclassical style, is utterly unlike most churches in this part of Germany. Its grand Doric columns evoke a Greek temple, and within, the dual staircase that leads up behind the altar draws the eyes to a splendid fresco depicting the birth of Christ; it was only painted three decades ago.
