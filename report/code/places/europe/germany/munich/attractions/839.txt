Tierpark Hellabrunn | Munich, Germany |  Some 6km south of the city centre, Tierpark Hellabrunn has 5000 furry, feathered and finned friends that rarely fail to enthral the little ones. The zoo was one of the first to organise animals by continent, with enclosures aiming to mimic natural habitats as closely as possible.
