Erinnerungsort Olympia-Atentat | Munich, Germany |  The 1974 Olympics are unfortunately known for the attack carried out by Palestinian terrorists, during which Israeli athletes were kidnapped and killed. This new memorial near the Olympic village remembers those murdered and a 10-minute video plays on a constant loop, relating the events of those terrible days.
