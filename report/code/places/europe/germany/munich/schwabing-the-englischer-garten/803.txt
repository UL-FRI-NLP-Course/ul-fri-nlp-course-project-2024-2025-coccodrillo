Kleinhesseloher See | Munich, Germany |  Sooner or later in the Englischer Garten you'll find your way to the Kleinhesseloher See, a lovely lake at the centre of the park. Work up a sweat while taking a spin around three little islands, then quaff a well-earned foamy one at the Seehaus beer garden.
