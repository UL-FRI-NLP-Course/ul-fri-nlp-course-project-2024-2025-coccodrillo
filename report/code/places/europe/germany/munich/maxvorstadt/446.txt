Antikensammlungen | Munich, Germany |  This old-school museum is an engaging showcase of exquisite Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities. The collection of Greek vases, each artistically decorated with gods and heroes, wars and weddings, is particularly outstanding. Other galleries present gold and silver jewellery and ornaments, figurines made from terracotta and more precious bronze, and superfragile glass drinking vessels. Tickets for the museum are also valid for the Glyptothek.
