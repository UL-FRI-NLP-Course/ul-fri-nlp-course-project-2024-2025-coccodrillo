Lenbachhaus | Munich, Germany |  With its fabulous wing added by noted architect Norman Foster, this glorious gallery is the go-to place to admire the vibrant canvases of Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, Paul Klee and other members of ground-breaking modernist group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), founded in Munich in 1911.
Contemporary art is another focal point. An eye-catcher is a glass-and-steel sculpture by Olafur Eliasson in the soaring atrium. Many other big names are also represented, including Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, Anselm Kiefer, Andy Warhol, Dan Flavin, Richard Serra and Jenny Holzer.Tickets are also valid for special exhibits at the nearby Kunstbau, a 120m-long tunnel above the KÃ¶nigsplatz U-Bahn station.
