Staatliches Museum Ã„gyptischer Kunst | Munich, Germany |  This small museum of late-19th-century Egyptian finds was moved to a purpose-built site in 2013. The 21st-century-style curation has left things feeling sparse, but there's still a lot to learn here about the 5000 years the pharaohs ruled what is now Egypt and Sudan.
