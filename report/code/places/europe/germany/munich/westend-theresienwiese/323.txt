Theresienwiese | Munich, Germany |  The huge Theresienwiese (Theresa Meadow), better known as Wies'n, southwest of the Altstadt, is the site of the Oktoberfest. At the western end of the 'meadow' is the Ruhmeshalle guarding solemn statues of Bavarian leaders, as well as the Bavariastatue, an 18m-high Amazon in the Statue of Liberty tradition, oak wreath in her hand and lion at her feet.
This iron lady has a cunning design that makes her seem solid, but actually you can climb via the knee joint up to the head for a great view of the Oktoberfest. At other times, views are not particularly inspiring.
