Monument to the Victims of National Socialism | Munich, Germany |  This striking monument is made up of four Ts holding up a block-like cage in which an eternal flame gutters in remembrance of those who died at the hands of the Nazis due to their political beliefs, race, religion, sexual orientation or disability. Moved to this spot in 2014, it's a sternly simple reminder of Munich's not-so-distant past.
