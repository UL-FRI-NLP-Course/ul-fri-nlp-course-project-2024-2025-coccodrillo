Museum Mensch und Natur | Munich, Germany |  Kids will have plenty of ooh and aah moments in the Museum of Humankind & Nature, in the Schloss Nymphenburg north wing. Anything but old school, it puts a premium on interactive displays, models, audiovisual presentations and attractive animal dioramas. It's all in German, but few language skills are needed to appreciate the visuals.
