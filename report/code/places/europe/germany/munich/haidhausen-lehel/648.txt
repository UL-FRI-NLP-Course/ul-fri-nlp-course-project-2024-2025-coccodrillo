Kulturzentrum Gasteig | Munich, Germany |  One of Munich's top cultural venues, the Kulturzentrum Gasteig caused quite a controversy in the mid-eighties due to its postmodern, boxy, glass-and-brick design in XXL dimensions. The complex harbours four concert halls, including the 2400-seat Philharmonie, the permanent home of the MÃ¼nchner Philharmoniker. It also attracts some huge names in the world of popular music.
