Friedensengel | Munich, Germany |  Just east of the Isar River, the Friedensengel (Angel of Peace) statue stands guard from its perch atop a 23m-high column. It commemorates the 1871 Treaty of Versailles, which ended the Franco-Prussian War, and the base contains some shimmering golden Roman-style mosaics.
