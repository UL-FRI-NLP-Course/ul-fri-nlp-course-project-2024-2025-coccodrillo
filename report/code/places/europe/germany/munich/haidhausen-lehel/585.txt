Museum Villa Stuck | Munich, Germany |  Around the turn of the 20th century, Franz von Stuck was a leading light on Munich's art scene, and his residence is one of the finest Jugendstil homes you're ever likely to see. Stuck came up with the intricate design, which forges tapestries, patterned floors, coffered ceilings and other elements into a harmonious work of art. Today his glorious pad is open as a museum with changing exhibitions.
