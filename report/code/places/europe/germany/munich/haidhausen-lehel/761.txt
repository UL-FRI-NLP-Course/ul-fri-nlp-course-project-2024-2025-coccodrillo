Pfarrkirche St Anna im Lehel | Munich, Germany |  The rather pompous neo-Romanesque Pfarrkirche St Anna im Lehel arrived on the scene in 1892 when the Klosterkirche St Anna im Lehel became too small. Conceived by locally born architect Gabriel von Seidl, it's worth a spin for the huge Byzantine-style painting behind the altar and little art nouveau touches throughout.
