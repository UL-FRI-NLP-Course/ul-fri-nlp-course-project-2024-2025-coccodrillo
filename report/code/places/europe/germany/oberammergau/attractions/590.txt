Pilatushaus | Bavarian Alps, Germany |  Aside from the Passion Play, Oberammergau's other claim to fame is its LÃ¼ftmalerei, the eye-popping house facades painted in an illusionist style. The pick of the crop is the amazing Pilatushaus, whose painted columns snap into 3D as you approach. It contains a gallery of glass traditional painting on the 1st floor and several workshops at ground level where you can watch demonstrations of local crafts.
