Oberammergau Museum | Bavarian Alps, Germany |  This is one of the best places to view exquisite examples of Oberammergau's famously intricate woodcarving art. The village has a long tradition of craftspeople producing anything from an entire nativity scene in a single walnut shell to a life-size Virgin Mary. If you get the urge to take some home, plenty of specialist shops around town sell pricey pieces.
