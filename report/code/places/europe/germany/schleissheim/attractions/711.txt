Schloss Lustheim | Bavaria, Germany |  While construction of Prince-Elector Max Emanuel's Neues Schloss Schleissheim was going on, the elector and his retinue resided in the fanciful hunting palace of Schloss Lustheim, on a little island in the eastern Schlosspark. It now provides an elegant setting for porcelain masterpieces from Meissen belonging to the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum.
