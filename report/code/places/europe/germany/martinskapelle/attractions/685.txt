Martinskapelle | The Black Forest, Germany |  Named after the tiny chapel at the head of the Breg Valley, Martinskapelle attracts cross-country skiers to its forested trails in winter and hikers when the snow melts. The steep road up to the 1085m peak negotiates some pretty hairy switchbacks, swinging past wood-shingle farmhouses that cling to forested slopes.
