Siegerlandmuseum im Oberen Schloss | Cologne & Northern Rhineland, Germany |  From Markt, Burgstrasse slopes up to the Oberes Schloss, a classic medieval fortress and the ancestral home of the rulers of Nassau-Oranien. Its labyrinth of rooms now houses the Siegerlandmuseum, the most interesting section of which is the wing with seven paintings and a bevy of etchings by Siegen-born painter Peter Paul Rubens. Other rooms cover aspects of local history.
