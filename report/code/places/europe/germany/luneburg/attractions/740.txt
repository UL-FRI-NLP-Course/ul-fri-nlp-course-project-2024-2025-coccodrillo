Auf dem Meere | Northern Germany, Germany |  If you continue west along Waagestrasse from the Markt and veer left, you’ll come to Auf dem Meere, a particularly striking Lüneburg street. Here the wavy pavements have pushed facades sideways or made buildings buckle in the middle. The street feels wonky all the way to St Michaeliskirche. Look at the steps leading to the church!
