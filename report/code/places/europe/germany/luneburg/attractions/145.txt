Am Sande | Northern Germany, Germany |  The cobbled, slightly wobbly street and square Am Sande is full of red-brick buildings with typically Hanseatic stepped gables. Even among these striking buildings, the black-and-white Industrie und Handelskammer (Trade and Industry Chamber, 1548) at the far western end stands out.
