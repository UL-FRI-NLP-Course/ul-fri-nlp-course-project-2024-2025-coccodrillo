Rathaus | Northern Germany, Germany |  The medieval Rathaus has a spectacular baroque facade, added in 1720 and decorated with coats of arms and three tiers of statues. The top row represents (from left to right): strength, trade, peace (the one with the staff), justice and moderation. The steeple, topped with 41 Meissen china bells, was installed on the cityâ€™s 1000th birthday in 1956. Tours cover the lavishly restored interior.
