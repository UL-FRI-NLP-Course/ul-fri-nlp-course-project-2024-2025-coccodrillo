Königssee | Berchtesgaden, Germany |  Gliding serenely across the wonderfully picturesque, emerald-green Königssee makes for some unforgettable memories and photo opportunities. Cradled by steep mountain walls some 5km south of Berchtesgaden, the Königssee is Germany’s highest lake (603m), with drinkably pure waters shimmering into fjordlike depths. Bus 841/843 makes the trip out here from the Berchtesgaden train station roughly every hour.
Escape the hubbub of the bustling lakeside tourist village of Schönau by taking an electric boat tour to St Bartholomä, a quaint onion-domed chapel on the western shore. At some point, the boat will stop while the captain plays a horn towards the Echo Wall – the sound will bounce seven times. From St Bartholomä, an easy trail leads to the wondrous Eiskapelle (ice chapel) in about one hour.You can also skip the crowds by meandering along the lake shore. It’s a nice and easy 3.5km return walk to the secluded Malerwinkel (Painter’s Corner), a lookout famed for its picturesque vantage point.
