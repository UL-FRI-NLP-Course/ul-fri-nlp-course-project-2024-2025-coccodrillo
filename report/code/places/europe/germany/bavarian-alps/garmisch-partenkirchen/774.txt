Jagdschloss Schachen | Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany |  A popular hiking route is to King Ludwig IIâ€™s hunting lodge, Jagdschloss Schachen, which can be reached via the Partnachklamm in about a four-hour hike (10km). A plain wooden hut from the outside, the interior is surprisingly magnificent; the Moorish Room is something straight out of Arabian Nights.
