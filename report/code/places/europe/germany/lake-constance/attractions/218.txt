Basilika Birnau | Lake Constance, Germany |  This exuberant, powder-pink Cistercian abbey church is one of Lake Constance's architectural highlights and a popular pilgrimage destination. It was built by the rococo master Peter Thumb of Vorarlberg in 1746. The decor is so intricate and profuse it's overwhelming. At some point your gaze will be drawn to the ceiling, where Gottfried Bernhard GÃ¶z worked his fresco magic.
