Sea Life | Konstanz, Germany |  Running a dragnet through your wallet, the borderline-kitsch Sea Life immerses you in an underwater world. Highlights include a shipwreck where you can handle starfish and get stingray close-ups, a shark tunnel, penguins, and a creepy corner blubbing with oddities such as frogfish and giant isopods.
