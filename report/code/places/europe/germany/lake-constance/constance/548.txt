Römersiedlung | Konstanz, Germany |  The glass pyramid in front of the Münster shelters the Römersiedlung, the 3rd-century-AD remains of the Roman fort Constantia that gave the city its name. You'll only get a sneak peek from above, so join one of the guided tours that begin at the tourist office for a touch of magic as a staircase opens from the cobbles and leads down to the ruins.
