Museum Starnberger See | Bavaria, Germany |  You may have to duck your head when touring this 400-year-old farmhouse that offers a glimpse of life on the lake as it once was. It also boasts a precious Ignaz GÃ¼nther sculpture in the little chapel. The modern extension showcases a fancy royal barge and a section on its construction.
