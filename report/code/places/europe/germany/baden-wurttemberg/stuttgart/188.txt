Schlossgarten | Stuttgart, Germany |  A terrific park for a wander right in the heart of the city, Stuttgart's sprawling Schlossgarten threads together the Mittlerer Schlossgarten, with its fine beer garden for summer imbibing, the sculpture-dotted Unterer Schlossgarten, and the Oberer Schlossgarten, home to stately landmarks such as the Staatstheater and the glass-fronted Landtag.
