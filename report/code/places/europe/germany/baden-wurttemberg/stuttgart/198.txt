Schlossplatz | Stuttgart, Germany |  Stuttgart's pride and joy is this central square, dominated by the exuberant three-winged Neues Schloss, an impressive, Versailles-inspired baroque palace that now houses government ministries. In summer, the square plays host to open-air concerts and festivals, such as the Sommerfest; in winter it twinkles festively with its enormous Weihnachtsmarkt (Christmas market).
