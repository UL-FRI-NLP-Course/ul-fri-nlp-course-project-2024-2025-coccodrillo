Jesuitenkirche | Heidelberg, Germany |  Rising above an attractive square just east of Universitätsplatz, the red-sandstone Jesuits’ church, with an all-white interior, is a fine example of 18th-century baroque. The Schatzkammer (treasury) displays precious religious artefacts. Look out for regular concerts.
