Schlosskirche | Mannheim, Germany |  Across the main courtyard of the Barockschloss Mannheim stands the baroque Schlosskirche, built from 1720 to 1731 and rebuilt after the war. Mozart performed here in 1777. It belongs to the Alt-Katholiken (Old Catholics), a movement that split with Rome over papal infallibility in the 1870s and is now part of the Anglican Communion.
