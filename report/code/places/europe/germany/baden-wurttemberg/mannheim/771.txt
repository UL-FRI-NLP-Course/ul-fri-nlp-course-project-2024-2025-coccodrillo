Jesuitenkirche | Mannheim, Germany |  A sumptuously ornate baroque vision, glowing with gold leaf, the Jesuitenkirche was built between 1733 and 1760. When Mozart spent time in Mannheim in the late 1700s, he praised its acoustics and atmosphere. Like the rest of the city, the church suffered damage during WWII, but it has since been fully restored.
