Fabergé Museum | Baden-Baden, Germany |  Admittedly it's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you happen to find Fabergé fascinating, you're going to love this museum devoted to its impossibly ornate imperial Easter eggs, jewellery and gem-encrusted animals made for Russian tsars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
