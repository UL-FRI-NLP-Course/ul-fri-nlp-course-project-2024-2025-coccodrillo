Mt Merkur | Baden-Baden, Germany |  Though modest in height, the 668m Mt Merkur commands widescreen views of Baden-Baden and the Murg Valley. Itâ€™s a popular spot for paragliding, gentle hiking and family picnics. Buses 204 and 205 stop near the funicular, which has been trundling to the top since 1913.
