Hängeseilbrücke Geierlay | Moselle Valley, Germany |  Stretching 360m at a height of 100m above ground, Germany's largest suspension bridge isn't for the faint-hearted but the valley views are spectacular. Walking trails criss-cross the area. From the car park at Mörsdorf, a 1.2km path leads to the bridge.
