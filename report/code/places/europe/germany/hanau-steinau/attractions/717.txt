Schloss Steinau | Fairy-Tale Road, Germany |  One of the most complete surviving early-modern castles in Europe, Steinau Castle is well worth a visit. Built for the Count of Hanau in the mid-16th century, its dry moat, flagged courtyard and pleasing jumble of towers and sloping roofs creates the very picture of a stern Germanic fortress. Access to the highest tower is an additional â‚¬1.
