St Wilhadi Kirche | Northern Germany, Germany |  Stade's oldest building is this hulking church, which has parts dating to the 14th century. Keeping the building standing to the present day has been the stuff of drama, what with wars, lightning and water-logged ground. Note the heavy buttresses on the exterior and the bands of iron around the pillars in the detail-packed interior. The small history brochure is a good read.
