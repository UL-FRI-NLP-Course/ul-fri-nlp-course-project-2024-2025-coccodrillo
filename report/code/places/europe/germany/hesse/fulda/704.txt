Dommuseum | Fairy-Tale Road, Germany |  Reached through a delightful garden strewn with stone carvings, the Domdechaneigarten, this museum occupies the cathedral's former seminary chapel. Relics tell the story of the abbey church and cathedral back to Carolingian times â€“ be sure to catch the spectacular Silver Altar and a spooky object reputed to be part of the skull of St Boniface.
