Neues Rathaus | Hanover, Germany |  An excellent way to get your bearings in Hanover is to visit the Neues Rathaus (built 1901â€“13) and ascend 98m in the curved elevator (the only one of its kind). It's shaped to travel to the top of the building's green dome, where there are four open-air observation platforms offering panoramic views as far as the Deister hills. The cabin can take only five people at a time so expect queues.
In the grand marble lobby downstairs, four city models depict Hanover from the Middle Ages to today; the sombre 1945 model shows the extent of the damage done by Allied bombing in WWII.
