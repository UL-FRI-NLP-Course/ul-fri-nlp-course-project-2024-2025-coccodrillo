Historische Museum Hannover | Hanover, Germany |  This museum of local history had just one exhibit hall open at research time; it's currently undergoing renovations for its permanent exhibits, due to open in October 2019. The museum offers a unique skyline view (via 81 steps) at the top of the 23m-high Beginenturm (attached to the rear of the building), the only medieval city-wall tower still remaining in Hanover.
