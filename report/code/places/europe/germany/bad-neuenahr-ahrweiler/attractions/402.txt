Dokumentationsstätte Regierungsbunker | Cologne & Northern Rhineland, Germany |  During the Cold War, there was no vast top-secret bunker complex bored into the Ahr Valley hillside – at least not officially. Now, however, you can see the truth at the museum set up along a 200m section of the nuclear-proof former ‘Emergency Seat of the Constitutional Organs of the Federal Republic of Germany’. Tours last 90 minutes; bring a jacket – it's chilly inside.
There's a real Dr Strangelove quality to what comforts the bureaucrats thought would be good to have at hand as the world ended.
