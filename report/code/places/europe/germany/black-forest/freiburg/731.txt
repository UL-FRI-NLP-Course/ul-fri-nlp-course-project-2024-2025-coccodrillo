Historisches Kaufhaus | Freiburg, Germany |  Facing the Münster’s south side and embellished with polychrome tiled turrets is the arcaded brick-red Historisches Kaufhaus, an early 16th-century merchants’ hall. The coats of arms on the oriels and the four figures above the balcony symbolise Freiburg’s allegiance to the House of Habsburg.
