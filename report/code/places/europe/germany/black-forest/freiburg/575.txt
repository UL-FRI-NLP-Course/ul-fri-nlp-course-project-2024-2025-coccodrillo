Rathausplatz | Freiburg, Germany |  Join locals relaxing in a cafe by the fountain in chestnut-shaded Rathausplatz, Freiburg's prettiest square. Pull out your camera to snap pictures of the square's ox-blood-red 16th-century Altes Rathaus (Old Town Hall) that houses the tourist office; the step-gabled 19th-century Neues Rathaus (New Town Hall); and the medieval Martinskirche church with its modern interior.
