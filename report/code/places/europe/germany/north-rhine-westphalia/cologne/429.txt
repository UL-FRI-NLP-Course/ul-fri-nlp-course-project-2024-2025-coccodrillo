MiQua Archaeological Zone | Cologne, Germany |  The square in front of Cologne's historical town hall has for years been ripped open as archaeologists unearthed fabulous finds from Roman times and the medieval Jewish quarter. The area is being developed to include a Jewish museum that will extend underground beneath the Rathausplatz. It will incorporate the Roman Praetorium (governor's palace) and a Jewish mikveh (ritual bath). Completion may happen in 2021.
