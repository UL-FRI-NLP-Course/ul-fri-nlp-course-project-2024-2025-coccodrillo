Andreaskirche | DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany |  This early baroque church, built from 1622 to 1629, is drenched in fanciful white stucco. Six baroque saint sculptures from the original altar are integrated into the sanctuary. More religious art awaits in the treasury in the upstairs gallery. A great time to visit is for the free organ concert at 4.30pm on Sundays.
