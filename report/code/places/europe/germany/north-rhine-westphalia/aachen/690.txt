Ludwig Forum Aachen | Aachen, Germany |  In a former umbrella factory, the well-respected Ludwig Forum trains the spotlight on American and European contemporary art (Warhol, Richter, Holzer, Penck, Haring) and also stages progressive changing exhibits. Among the most eye-catching works is the sculpture Supermarket Lady (1971) by Duane Hanson, a poignant critique of mass consumption.
