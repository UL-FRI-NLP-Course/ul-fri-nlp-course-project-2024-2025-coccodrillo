Puppenbrunnen | Aachen, Germany |  A modern fountain that's a crowd-pleasing work of mechanical art; look for the cock on top (a symbol of Napoleon's love for Aachen). Other details (all with meaning), include a horse, professor, canon and more.
Created in 1975, it is considered a main work by Aachen sculptor Bonifatius Stirnberg.
