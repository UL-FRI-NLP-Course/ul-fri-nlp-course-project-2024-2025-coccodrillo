Suermondt Ludwig Museum | Aachen, Germany |  The Suermondt Ludwig Museum is especially proud of its medieval sculpture but also has fine works by Cranach, DÃ¼rer, Macke, Dix and other masters. An oddly fascinating highlight is the room of curiosities with such items as a stuffed shark and a falcon mummy on display.
It's all beautifully presented in a 19th-century town mansion.
