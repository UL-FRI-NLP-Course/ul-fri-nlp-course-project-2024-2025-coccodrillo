Münster Basilica | Bonn, Germany |  The landmark Münster Basilica was built on the graves of the two martyred Roman soldiers who later got promoted to be the city’s patron saints. It got its Gothic look in the 13th century but the Romanesque origins survive beautifully in the cloister. Both church and cloister are closed for restoration until at least 2019.
