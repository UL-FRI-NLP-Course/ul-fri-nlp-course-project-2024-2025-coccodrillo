Kurfürstliches Schloss | Bonn, Germany |  The palatial 1705 Kurfürstliche Residenz was once the immodest home of the prince-electors of Cologne and has been part of Bonn’s university since 1818. Its south side opens up to the expansive Hofgarten (Palace Garden), a popular gathering place for students.
