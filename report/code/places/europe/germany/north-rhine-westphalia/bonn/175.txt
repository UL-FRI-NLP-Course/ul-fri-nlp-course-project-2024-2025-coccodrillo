Kunstmuseum Bonn | Bonn, Germany |  Beyond its dramatic foyer, the Kunstmuseum Bonn presents 20th-century works, especially by August Macke and other Rhenish expressionists, as well as such post-WWII avant-gardists as Beuys, Baselitz and Kiefer. It has a vigorous schedule of special exhibitions showcasing various facets of contemporary art.
Competing with the art is the stark beauty of the building itself. Blueprinted by Axel Schultes, a Berlin-based architect, it juxtaposes airiness with strict geometric structures that play with light and shadow. Note especially the dramatic main staircase, the shape of which resembles an hourglass.
