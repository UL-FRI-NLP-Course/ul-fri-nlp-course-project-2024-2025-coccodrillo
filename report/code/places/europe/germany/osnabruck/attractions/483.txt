Rathaus | Cologne & Northern Rhineland, Germany |  It was on the Rathaus steps that the Peace of Westphalia was proclaimed on 25 October 1648, ending the Thirty Years' War. The preceding peace negotiations were conducted partly in MÃ¼nster, about 60km south, and partly in the Rathaus' Friedenssaal (Peace Hall). On the left as you enter the Rathaus are portraits of the negotiators. Also look around the Schatzkammer (Treasure Chamber) opposite, especially for the 13th-century Kaiserpokal (Kaiser goblet).
