Messe | Frankfurt am Main, Germany |  Spread out between 1km and 2km northwest of the Hauptbahnhof, Frankfurtâ€™s famous trade fair grounds are anchored by the iconic MesseTurm, a 256m-high skyscraper nicknamed der Bleistift (the pencil) due to its cylindrical core topped by a 36m-high pyramid. The Messe grounds have absolutely nothing of interest to offer visitors except during trade fairs, which famously wreak periodic havoc on the local tourist economy.
