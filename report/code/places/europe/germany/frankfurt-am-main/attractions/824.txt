Frau Rauscher Brunnen | Frankfurt am Main, Germany |  Inspired by a local song about apple wine, the Frau Rauscher Brunnen – a statue of a fierce-looking, apple-wine-jug-wielding woman – periodically sprays a stream of water onto the footpath during the warmer months; when the street’s busy, you'll often see pedestrians get drenched.
