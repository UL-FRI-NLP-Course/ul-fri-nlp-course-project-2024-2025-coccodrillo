Alte Nikolaikirche | Frankfurt am Main, Germany |  Topped by a single spire, this red-sandstone Protestant church – begun in the 13th century – is situated on the south side of the Römerberg and was one of the few Altstadt structures to survive WWII almost intact. In the tranquil interior, under late-Gothic vaulting, are stone carvings and 14th- and 15th-century gravestones.
