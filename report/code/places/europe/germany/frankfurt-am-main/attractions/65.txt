Römerberg | Frankfurt am Main, Germany |  The Römerberg is Frankfurt’s old central square. Ornately gabled half-timbered buildings, reconstructed after WWII, give an idea of how beautiful the city’s medieval core once was. In the square's centre is the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen.
The Römerberg is especially lovely as a backdrop for the Christmas market in December.
