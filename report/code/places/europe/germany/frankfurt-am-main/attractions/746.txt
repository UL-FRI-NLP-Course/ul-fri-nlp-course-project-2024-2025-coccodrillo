Liebieghaus | Frankfurt am Main, Germany |  Inside a gorgeous 1890s villa, the Liebieghaus' superb sculpture collection encompasses Greek, Roman, Egyptian, medieval, Renaissance and baroque works, plus some items from East Asia. Special exhibitions (extra charges may apply) sometimes displace parts of the permanent collection. There's a beautiful cross-vaulted cafe on site.
