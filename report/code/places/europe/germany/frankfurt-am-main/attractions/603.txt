Kaisersaal | Frankfurt am Main, Germany |  Reached from Limpurgergasse (around the south side of RÃ¶mer) via a small courtyard and a spiral staircase made of carved red sandstone, the barrel-vaulted Kaisersaal is adorned with the mid-19th-century portraits of 52 rulers from between the 8th century and 1806. Official receptions and ceremonies often take place here, so check opening hours ahead of time.
