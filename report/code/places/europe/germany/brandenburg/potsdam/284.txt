Filmpark Babelsberg | Potsdam, Germany |  Attached to the actual Babelsberg film studios, this movie-themed amusement park presents stunt shows, animal shows, outdoor movie sets, a 4D cinema and a 3D video arcade. You'll also get to go behind the scenes, visiting outdoor sets and meeting make-up artists, set builders and other craftspeople who make the magic happen. It's well worth renting the audioguide (â‚¬5) to demystify the movie-making process, lift the lid on the studio's illustrious history and pick up gossip on stars.
To get here, head to Potsdam Hauptbahnhof or the Babelsberg S-Bahn station, then take bus 601 or 690 to the Filmpark stop.
