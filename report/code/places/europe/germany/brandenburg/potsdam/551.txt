Neue Kammern | Potsdam, Germany |  The New Chambers, built by Knobelsdorff in 1748, were originally an orangery and later converted into a guest palace. The interior drips with rococo opulence, most notably the square Jasper Hall, which is drenched in precious stones and lidded by a Venus fresco, and the Ovidsaal, a grand ballroom with gilded wall reliefs depicting scenes from Ovid's Metamorphosis.
