Schloss Cecilienhof | Potsdam, Germany |  This English-style country palace, completed in 1917 for Crown Prince Wilhelm and his wife Cecilie, was the last residence built by the Hohenzollern clan. Their private quarters can be seen on a tour, but the site is mostly famous for hosting the 1945 Potsdam Conference where Stalin, Truman and Churchill (and later his successor Clement Attlee) hammered out Germany’s post-war fate and incidentally laid the foundation for the Cold War.
A combination ticket with the nearby Marble Palace is €10 (concession €7).
