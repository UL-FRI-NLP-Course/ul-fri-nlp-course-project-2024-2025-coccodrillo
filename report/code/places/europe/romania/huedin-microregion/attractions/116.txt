Octavian Goga Memorial Museum | Transylvania, Romania |  Peer into the life of Romanian poet and activist Octavian Goga (1881â€“1938) at this museum complex in Ciucea, where he died. Controversial Hungarian 20th-century poet Endre Ady also lived in Ciucea, and one of his houses is now a small museum within the complex. Insights are limited for non-Romanian speakers, though the gardens and traditional buildings are pleasant to wander.
