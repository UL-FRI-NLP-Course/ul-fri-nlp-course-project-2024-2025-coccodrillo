Archaeology & History Museum | Romania, Europe |  Arad's modest history museum housed in the Palace of Culture is a good primer for anyone interested in the city's complex origins, including 150 years of Ottoman occupation until 1699. After that the city served as a military bastion of the Habsburgs and, briefly, in 1849, as a centre of the Hungarian uprising â€“ the museum has good coverage of that period and of the 1989 revolution.
