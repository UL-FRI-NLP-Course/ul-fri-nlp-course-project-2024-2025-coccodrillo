Ethnographic Museum | Wallachia, Romania |  This is a highly informative, well-organised exhibition of folk traditions in the Oltenia region surrounding Craiova. The exhibition begins downstairs with bread-making and progresses through pottery, tanning, clothing, weaving and folk art. There's little English signage, but there may be someone on hand who speaks some English and can show you around. The setting is the historic Casa BÄƒniei, dating from the 17th century. Recommended.
