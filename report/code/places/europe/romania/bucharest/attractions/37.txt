Rebirth Memorial | Bucharest, Romania |  This striking memorial, respected and reviled in equal measure, marks the dramatic events of 1989, when many people died in this area for their opposition to the Ceau≈üescu regime. The white obelisk piercing a basket-like crown stands on an island in Calea Victoriei. Local wags have dubbed it the 'potato of the revolution'.
