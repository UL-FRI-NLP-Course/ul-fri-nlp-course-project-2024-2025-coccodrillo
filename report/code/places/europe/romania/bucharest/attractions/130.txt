Museum of the History of Bucharest | Bucharest, Romania |  Housed in a neo-Gothic palace built in the 1830s to host fancy balls, this small museum, facing Piaţa Universităţii, is a lovely spot with an interesting collection of old artefacts, photos and costumes. Designed by two Austrian architects, the palace was built in 1832–34 for the Şuţu family, notorious for their high-society parties.
