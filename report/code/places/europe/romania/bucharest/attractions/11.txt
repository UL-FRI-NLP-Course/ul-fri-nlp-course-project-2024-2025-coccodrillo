Grigore Antipa Natural History Museum | Bucharest, Romania |  One of the few attractions in Bucharest aimed squarely at kids, this natural-history museum, showing off Romania's plant and animal life, has been thoroughly renovated. It features lots of modern bells and whistles, such as video displays, games and interactive exhibits. Much of it has English signage.
