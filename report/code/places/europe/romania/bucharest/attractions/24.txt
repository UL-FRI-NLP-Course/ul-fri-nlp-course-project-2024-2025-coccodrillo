Patriarchal Cathedral | Bucharest, Romania |  From the centre of Pia≈£a Unirii, look southwest to the Patriarchal Cathedral, the centre of Romanian Orthodox faith, built between 1656 and 1658. It triumphantly peeks over once-grand housing blocks on B-dul Unirii designed to 'hide' Bucharest's churches. During the 15th century, a small wooden church surrounded by vineyards occupied this site. None of the interior paintings has survived, with the exception of one icon depicting Constantin and Helen, the cathedral's patron saints.
