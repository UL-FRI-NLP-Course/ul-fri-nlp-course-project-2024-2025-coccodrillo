Old Princely Court | Bucharest, Romania |  The Old Princely Court dates to the 15th century, when Bucharest emerged as the capital of the Wallachian principality. The ruins are being slowly excavated and were closed in 2016 to allow for general renovation. It's not clear when the court will open to visitors. The Vlad Ţepeş statue out the front makes a good photo.
