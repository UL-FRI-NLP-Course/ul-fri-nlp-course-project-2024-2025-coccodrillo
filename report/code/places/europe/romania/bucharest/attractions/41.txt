Theodor Aman Museum | Bucharest, Romania |  This is the lovingly restored residence and studio of 19th-century Romanian painter Theodor Aman. Aman's skill was in small, finely rendered oil paintings depicting aspects of local and national life. The detail is so fine on some of the paintings, the figures appear to take on three-dimensional form.
