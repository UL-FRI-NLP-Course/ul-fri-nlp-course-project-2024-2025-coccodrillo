Church of the Icon | Bucharest, Romania |  One of the city's best-known churches, the Church of the Icon takes its name from an icon of the Virgin Mary that was a gift from Constantin Brâncoveanu. The original brick church here was built by monk and former privy secretary Mihail Băbeanu between 1745 and 1750, though most of that structure was destroyed in earthquakes, and much of what you see today dates from the 19th century.
