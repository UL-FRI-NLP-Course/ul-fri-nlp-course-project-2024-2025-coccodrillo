Princess Bălaşa Church | Bucharest, Romania |  An impressive church that survived the demolitions of the 1980s is the candy-striped Princess Bălaşa Church, northwest of Piaţa Unirii. It's named after Wallachian Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu’s sixth daughter, who had a small wooden church built here in 1744 that was subsequently damaged and rebuilt on several occasions.
