CEC Bank Palace | Bucharest, Romania |  Across the street from the National History Museum, the headquarters of the Romanian Savings Bank, CEC, is a gleaming and thoroughly renovated neoclassical masterpiece dating from the late 19th century. There's nothing really to see inside (it's a normal bank), but the exterior, especially at night, is an instant wow.
