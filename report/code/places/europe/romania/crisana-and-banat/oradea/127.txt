Oradea Fortress | Romania, Europe |  Oradea's fortress dates from the 15th and 16th centuries and played a key role in conflicts between the Turks, Austrians and Hungarians over the years. The fortress is shaped like a pentagon, with five towers and thick defensive walls, and has frescoed interior walls. It is largely still under reconstruction but you can stroll around the grounds.
