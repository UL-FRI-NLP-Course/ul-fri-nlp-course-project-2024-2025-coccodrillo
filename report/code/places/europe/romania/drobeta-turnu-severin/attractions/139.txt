Water Tower | Wallachia, Romania |  Severin's most striking building is this massive water tower, dating from 1910. It was one of the first buildings here to use iron in its construction. These days you can walk the 159 steps to the top for views out over the Danube (or take the lift). It's located about six blocks north of B-dul Carol I, following Str Bibicescu.
