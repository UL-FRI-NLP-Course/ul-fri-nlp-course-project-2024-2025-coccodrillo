Sinaia Monastery | Sinaia, Romania |  The church and monks’ cells on this site during the 17th century weren’t ample enough to accommodate Sinaia’s growing religious community, so in 1846 this serene complex was built. Its main church is a marvel of carved floral decoration, with oil paintings within. Easily as magnificent is the backdrop of forested mountains.
