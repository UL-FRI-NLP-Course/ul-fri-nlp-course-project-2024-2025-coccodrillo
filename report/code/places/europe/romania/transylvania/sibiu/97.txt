Pharmaceutical Museum | Sibiu, Romania |  On the site of Sibiu's first documented apothecary, this museum delves into the herb-scented history of medicine. More than 6600 items such as microscopes, mortars and pestles, pills, powders and shudder-inducing suppository moulding kits and surgical kits are presented around the three rooms of this 1568 building.
Displays about the beginnings of homeopathy are interesting, though they would benefit from a little more balance.
