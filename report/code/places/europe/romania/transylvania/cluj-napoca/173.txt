Synagogue of Deportees | Cluj-Napoca, Romania |  The late-19th-century synagogue on this spot was rebuilt and restored after WWII. Topped with silver onion domes, the Moorish-style building (closed to visitors) is now dedicated to the memory of more than 16,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz from Cluj-Napoca in 1944.
