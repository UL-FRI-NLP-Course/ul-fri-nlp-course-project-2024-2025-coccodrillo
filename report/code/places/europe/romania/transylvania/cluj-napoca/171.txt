Hungarian Cemetery | Cluj-Napoca, Romania |  Founded in the 16th century, this stately cemetery is a memorable place to stroll among elegant tombs and mausoleums of Transylvanian poets and composers, while crows call from the surrounding trees. Enter it downhill from Str Avram Iancu, south of the main square.
