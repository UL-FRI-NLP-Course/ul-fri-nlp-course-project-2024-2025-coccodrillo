Citadel | Braşov, Romania |  In 1524 a new wooden citadel was built in Braşov, on top of Citadel Hill just north, though the stone wall ruins you now see are from the 16th and 17th centuries. It's a steep trek from the old town, but these old walls are a pleasant spot to watch the sun set over Braşov.
