Memorial to Victims of the 1989 Revolution | Braşov, Romania |  Running north of Piaţa Sfatului, the pedestrianised Str Republicii provides respite from the traffic that detracts from the charm of the rest of the old town. At the promenade’s northern end is the wooden-cross Memorial to Victims of the 1989 Revolution.
