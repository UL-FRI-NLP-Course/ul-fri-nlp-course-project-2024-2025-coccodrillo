St Nicholas’ Cathedral | Braşov, Romania |  With forested hills rising behind its prickly Gothic spires, St Nicholas’ Cathedral is one of Braşov's most spectacular views. First built in wood in 1392, it was replaced by a Gothic stone church in 1495 and later embellished in Byzantine style. It was once enclosed by military walls; today the site has a small cemetery. Inside are murals of Romania’s last king and queen, covered by plaster to protect them from communist leaders and uncovered in 2004.
