Băgaciu Evangelical Church | Transylvania, Romania |  When we passed through, this early-15th-century fortified church was in need of a revamp, with a rusty clock face peeling from its tower and birds swooping in and out of the building. It’s an impressive photo-op nonetheless.
Băgaciu is a 30km drive north and east of Mediaș. The road is rough in places.
