Nicolae Grigorescu Museum | Wallachia, Romania |  This small museum and memorial is dedicated to the country's most famous artist, Nicolae Grigorescu (1838â€“1907). Grigorescu studied in Paris with Pierre-Auguste Renoir and much of his mature work revolved around landscapes and peasant life, though his depictions of battles and prisoners, produced while volunteering at the front during the Romanian Independence War, are also renowned.
