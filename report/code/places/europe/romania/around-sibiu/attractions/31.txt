ASTRA National Museum Complex | Transylvania, Romania |  Five kilometres from central Sibiu, this is Europe's largest open-air ethnographic museum, where churches, mills and traditional homes number among 400 folk-architecture monuments on-site. In summer, ASTRA hosts numerous fairs, dance workshops and musical performances, so it's worthwhile checking the website for events. Thereâ€™s also a nice gift shop and restaurant with creek-side bench seats.
