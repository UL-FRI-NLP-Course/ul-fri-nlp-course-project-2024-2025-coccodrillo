Ethnographic Museum | Transylvania, Romania |  Almost in the skirts of the Cindrel Mountains, faded Răşinari has this little museum. Next to the town hall, more than 1500 items from rural life are amassed here: ceramics, pottery, delicately painted furniture, and an 18th-century stove.
From Cisnădie, drive west and then north along route 106D for 8km until you see a turn-off to Răşinari, which lies another 5km southwest.
