Roman Mosaic | Constan≈£a, Romania |  Located just behind and south of the National History & Archaeological Museum, a modern building protects what's left of a Roman floor mosaic dating from the 4th century that was discovered in the 1960s. The site is near where the forum of ancient Tomis is thought to have existed. On the grounds surrounding the mosaic are old Roman tombstones, complete with highly moving and surprisingly modern epitaphs that have been translated into English.
