Casino | Constanţa, Romania |  Constanţa's stunning but sadly derelict art-nouveau casino, dating from 1910, was awaiting a long overdue renovation at the time of research and closed to the public. The building was commissioned by King Carol I and once drew monied holidaymakers from across Europe. It fell on hard times after the fall of communism and has struggled to find a suitor ever since.
