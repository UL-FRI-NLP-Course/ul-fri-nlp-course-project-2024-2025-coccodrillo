National History & Archaeological Museum | Constan≈£a, Romania |  This is the city's most important museum, though on balance it's a minor disappointment. The stunning exhibits of vases, jewellery and statuary from the Greek and Roman periods, lasting until about AD 500, easily justify the admission price, but the top-floor exhibits on more recent times lack signage in English.
