Art Museum | Constan≈£a, Romania |  This airy museum in an atrium is heavy on 19th-century realism and landscapes, including those by Nicolae Grigorescu, whose pointillist and Impressionist paintings anticipated more modern movements. Our favourite has to be his Study of a Cow. The upper level is given over to the dark abstract modernist Ion Alin Gheorghiu.
