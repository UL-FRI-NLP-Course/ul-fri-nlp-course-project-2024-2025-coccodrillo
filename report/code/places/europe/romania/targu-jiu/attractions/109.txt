Table of Silence | Wallachia, Romania |  The Table of Silence, one of Constantin Brâncuşi's sculptures, stands at the western end of Târgu Jiu's central park on the banks of the Jiu River. The work is comprised of a circular stone table with 12 chairs. The table represents where soldiers gather in silence before a battle. There's one chair for each month of the year; their hourglass shapes stand for the passage of time.
