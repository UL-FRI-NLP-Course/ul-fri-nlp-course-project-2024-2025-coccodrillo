Gate of the Kiss | Wallachia, Romania |  This evocative gate stands at the entrance to Târgu Jiu’s central park and is a logical place to begin a tour of Constantin Brâncuşi's sculptures. The small but moving Gate of the Kiss is in the shape of an arch and is meant to commemorate Romania’s unification at the end of WWI.
