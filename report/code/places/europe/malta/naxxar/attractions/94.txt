Palazzo Parisio | Malta, Europe |  The glorious Palazzo Parisio was originally built in 1733 by Grand Master Antonio Manoel de Vilhena, then acquired and refurbished by a Maltese noble family in the late 19th century. The magnificent interior (in particular the gilded ballroom) and baroque gardens resemble a miniature Versailles. You can also eat at Luna restaurant, and tea in the gardens is particularly lovely.
