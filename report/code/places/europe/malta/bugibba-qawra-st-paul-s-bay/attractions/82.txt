Malta Classic Car Collection | Northern Malta, Malta |  Housed in purpose-built 3000-sq-metre premises, the Malta Classic Car Collection is a tribute to Carol Galea's love of cars. The privately owned collection of mint-condition vehicles (cars and motorbikes) includes plenty of 1950s and '60s British- and Italian-made classics, plus vintage jukeboxes and memorabilia from these eras to get you in the mood. Look for the classic blue Bugatti sports car outside.
