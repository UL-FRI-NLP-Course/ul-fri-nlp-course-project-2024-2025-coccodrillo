Church of St Paul's Bonfire | Northern Malta, Malta |  The old fishing village of St Paul's Bay, now merged with BuÄ¡ibba, has retained something of its traditional Maltese character and has a few historical sights. The 17th-century Church of St Paul's Bonfire stands on the waterfront to the south of Plajja Tal'Bognor, supposedly on the spot where the saint first scrambled ashore. A bonfire is lit outside the church during the Festival of St Paul's Shipwreck (10 February). Mass times are listed at the front of the church.
