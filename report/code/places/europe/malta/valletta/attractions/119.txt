Prospettiva | Valletta, Malta |  This installation was designed by Maltese architect Chris Briffa to celebrate V18 (Valletta as European City of Culture in 2018). The work merges the city's five different gates into a 2D structure that is disassembled into planes, and is a striking sight close to St James Bastion.
