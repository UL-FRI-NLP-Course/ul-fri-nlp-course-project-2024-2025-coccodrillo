Saluting Battery | Valletta, Malta |  The Saluting Battery is where a cannon once fired salutes to visiting naval vessels. The battery has been restored, and a cannon is fired Monday through Saturday at noon and 4pm with great ceremony – it's well worth making time to see this, and children will enjoy it. Try to time your visit for a tour – the enthusiastic, costumed guides explain how the cannon is loaded and fired.
