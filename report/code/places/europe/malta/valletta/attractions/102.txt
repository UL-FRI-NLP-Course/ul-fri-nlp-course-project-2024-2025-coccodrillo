Manoel Theatre | Valletta, Malta |  Malta's national theatre was built in 1731 and is one of the oldest theatres in Europe. The building is being slowly restored, but is still in use for events, and can be visited on interesting guided tours. Booking ahead a few days prior is recommended. Highlights of the theatre include a baroque, gilt-twinkling auditorium with a huge chandelier.
