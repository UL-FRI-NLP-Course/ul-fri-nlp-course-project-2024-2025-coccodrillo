Royal Opera House | Valletta, Malta |  Built in the 1860s, the once imperious Opera House was destroyed during a German air raid in 1942. Its gutted shell was left as a reminder of the war, and now acts as a framework for the Renzo Pianoâ€“designed open-air performance space, where bottle-green seating is raised above the ruins. It's a wonderful place to catch a concert, which are most frequent during the Arts Festival.
