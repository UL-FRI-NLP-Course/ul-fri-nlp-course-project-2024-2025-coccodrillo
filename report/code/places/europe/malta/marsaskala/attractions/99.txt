St Thomas' Tower | Southern Malta, Malta |  This small 17th-century fortress lies at the northern point of St Thomas Bay. It was built by the Knights of St John after a Turkish raiding party landed in Marsaskala Bay in 1614 and plundered the nearby village of Å»ejtun. Surrounded by weeds and the abandoned Jerma Palace Hotel, the tower is in need of restoration and the interior can't be accessed.
