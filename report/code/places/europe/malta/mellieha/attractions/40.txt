Popeye Village | Northern Malta, Malta |  Steep-sided, pretty little Anchor Bay was named after the many Roman anchors that were found on the seabed by divers, some of which can be seen in the Maritime Museum at Vittoriosa. In 1979 Anchor Bay was transformed into the ramshackle fishing village of Sweethaven, the set for the 1980 Hollywood musical Popeye, starring Robin Williams. The vintage set still stands and houses an old-fashioned theme park; it's great fun for kids.
Admission includes animation shows, splash pools and a 15-minute boat ride. You can pay extra for the chance to make a movie (â‚¬6), which is particularly good fun.
