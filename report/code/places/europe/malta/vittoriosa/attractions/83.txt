Armoury | Vittoriosa, Malta |  Built in the 16th century, this was used by the Knights to store ammunition, and had a door on each of its four sides for ease of access. It was later used as a hospital during the Great Siege and the British converted it into a permanent hospital later. At the time of research it was closed for restoration and will subsequently be occupied by the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law.
