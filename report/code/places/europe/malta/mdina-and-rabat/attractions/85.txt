St Agatha's Crypt & Catacombs | Malta, Europe |  These catacombs contain a series of remarkable frescos dating from the 12th to 15th centuries. According to legend, this was the hiding place of St Agatha when she fled Sicily. Back at ground level is a quirky little museum containing everything from fossils and minerals to coins, church vestments and Etruscan, Roman and Egyptian artefacts. Regular tours of the crypt and catacombs are available.
