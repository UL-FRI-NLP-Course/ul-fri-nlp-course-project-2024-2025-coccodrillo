Church of Saints Peter & Paul | Gozo, Malta |  Nadur’s ornate Church of Saints Peter and Paul was built in the late 18th century – the entrance is framed by white statues of the two saints, giving the church its local nickname of iż-Żewġ (the pair). The interior is richly decorated with marble sculptures, and the vault is covered with 150 paintings. The surrounding square has recently been revitalised.
