Pomskizillious Museum of  Toys | Gozo, Malta |  This small labour of love has an impressive array of 19th-century and 1930s doll houses, toy soldiers, and spooky china dolls, mostly in glass cases. There's a display case devoted to nonsense poet Edward Lear, who coined the word 'pomskizillious' to describe Gozitan scenery.
