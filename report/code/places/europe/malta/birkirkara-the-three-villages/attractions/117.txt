Church of St Helen | Malta, Europe |  Birkirkara's Church of St Helen is probably the most ornate of Malta's churches, a late flowering of baroque exuberance built in the mid-18th century. On the strength of his performance here, the designer, Domenico Cachia, was given the job of remodelling the facade of the Auberge de Castile in Valletta.
