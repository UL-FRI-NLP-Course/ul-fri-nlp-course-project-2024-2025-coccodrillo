Chapel of the Annunciation | Southern Malta, Malta |  On a minor road between Żurrieq and Mqabba is the Chapel of the Annunciation, in the deserted medieval settlement of Ħal Millieri. This tiny church, set in a pretty garden, dates from the mid-15th century and contains important 15th-century frescos – the only surviving examples of medieval religious art in Malta.
