Snowshill Manor & Garden | The Cotswolds, England |  Once home to eccentric poet and architect Charles Paget Wade (1883–1956), this wonderful medieval mansion stands just over 2 miles south of Broadway. It now displays Wade’s extraordinary collection of crafts and design, ranging from musical instruments to Southeast Asian masks and Japanese samurai armour.
The impressive gardens hold the Priest’s House, where Wade actually lived, along with pools, terraces and wonderful views.
