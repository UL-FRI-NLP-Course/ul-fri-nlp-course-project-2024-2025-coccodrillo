Broadway Tower | The Cotswolds, England |  Built in 1798 to resemble an imaginary Saxon fort, this turreted Gothic folly looks down on Broadway from atop the escarpment, 1 mile southeast. William Morris spent a summer here, so exhibitions on its successive levels focus on the Arts and Crafts movement. The main reason to visit, though, is for the stunning all-round views from its rooftop platform.
There’s a cosy cafe in the parking area (dishes £6 to £10).The tower is on the Cotswold Way, with a path leading 2 miles uphill to it from near St Eadburgha’s Church, a mile south of Broadway.
