Cregneash Village Folk Museum | Isle of Man, England |  Until the early part of the 20th century, most farmers on the island engaged in a practice known as crofting â€“ a social system defined by small-scale communal food production. This folk museum on a raised plateau on the island's southern tip includes a traditional Manx cottage where you can see how crofters lived, while out in the fields you can see four-horned sheep and Manx cats, which you're encouraged to pat.
