Dunstanburgh Castle | Northumberland Coast, England |  The dramatic 1.5-mile walk along the coast from Craster (not accessible by car) is the most scenic path to this moody, weather-beaten castle. Its construction began in 1314 and it was strengthened during the Wars of the Roses, but left to crumble, becoming ruined by 1550. Parts of the original wall and gatehouse keep are still standing and it's a tribute to its builders that so much remains.
You can also reach the castle on foot from Embleton (1.5 miles), but access can be cut off at high tide.
