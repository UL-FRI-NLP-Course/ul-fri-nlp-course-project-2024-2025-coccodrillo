Well Hung Lover | Bristol, England |  One of Banksy's best loved pieces of street art features an apparently two-timing wife, an angry husband and a naked man dangling from a window. That it sits on the side of a sexual health clinic is surely no coincidence.
The best view is from the mini bridge on Park St that arches over Frogmore St. You'll notice blue blotches on the design â€“ the result of someone firing off a paintball gun.
