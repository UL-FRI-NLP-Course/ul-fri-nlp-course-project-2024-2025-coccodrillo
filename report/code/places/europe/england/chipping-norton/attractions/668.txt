St Mary's Church | The Cotswolds, England |  A classic Cotswold wool church, St Mary's has a magnificent Perpendicular nave and clerestory, several alabaster tombs and fluted, diamond-shaped pillars. Most of it was built in 1448, but two arches in the chancel date back to around 1200. Carved 15th-century ceiling bosses in its hexagonal porch include a sheep overpowering a wolf, and the possibly pagan but common visitor to British churches, the Green Man â€“ look for his leafy beard.
