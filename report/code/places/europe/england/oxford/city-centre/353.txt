Bridge of Sighs | Oxford, England |  As you stroll along New College Lane, look up at the steeped Bridge of Sighs linking the two halves of Hertford College. Completed in 1914, it's sometimes erroneously referred to as a copy of the famous bridge in Venice, but it looks much more like that city's Rialto Bridge.
