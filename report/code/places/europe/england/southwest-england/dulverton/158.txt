Tarr Steps | Exmoor National Park, England |  Exmoor's most famous landmark is an ancient stone clapper bridge shaded by gnarled old trees. Its huge slabs are propped up on stone columns embedded in the River Barle. Local folklore aside (which declares it was used by the Devil for sunbathing), it first pops into the historical record in the 1600s, and has had to be rebuilt after 21st-century floods. The steps are signed off the B3223 Dulvertonâ€“Simonsbath road, 5 miles northwest of Dulverton.
You can also hike there from Dulverton along the banks of the River Barle (12 miles return).
