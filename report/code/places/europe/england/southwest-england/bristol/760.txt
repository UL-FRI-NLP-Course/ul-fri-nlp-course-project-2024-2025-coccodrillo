Mild Mild West | Bristol, England |  This wry piece of graffiti art was painted by local lad Banksy. It features a Molotov cocktailâ€“wielding teddy bear who's facing three riot police. It's thought to be a fond comment on the city's vibe: edgy but somehow comfy too. It's next to the Canteen cafe-bar (on the right as you look at it), the best views are from the Jamaica St junction.
