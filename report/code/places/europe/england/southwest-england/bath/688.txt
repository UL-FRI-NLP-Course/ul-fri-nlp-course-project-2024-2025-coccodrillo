Sydney Gardens | Bath, England |  On a sunny day, do what countless Bath residents have done for centuries â€“ walk over Pulteney Bridge browsing the shops, then down elegant Great Pulteney St and skirt the impressive Holburne Museum to enter this urban oasis. You'll find dog walkers, picnickers and families, lawns, bridges, waterways and tennis courts (they're free to use, but keep games to an hour if people are waiting).
