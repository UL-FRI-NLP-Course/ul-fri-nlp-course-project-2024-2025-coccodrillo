St Oswald's Church | The Lake District, England |  Named after a Viking saint, Grasmere's medieval chapel is where Wordsworth and his family attended church service every Sunday for many years. It's also their final resting place – under the spreading bows of a great yew tree, the Wordsworth's family graves are tucked into a quiet corner of the churchyard. A peaceful memorial garden to fund the church's restoration has recently been established next door – planted, of course, with swathes of daffodils.
Among the tombstones are those belonging to William, his wife Mary, his sister Dorothy and his children Dora, William, Thomas and Catherine. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's son Hartley is also buried here, along with several Quillinans; Edward Quillinan became Wordsworth's son-in-law in 1841, having married his beloved daughter Dora.The church itself is worth a look. Inside you'll find Wordsworth's own prayer book and his favourite pew, marked by a plaque. The church is one of the oldest in the Lake District, mostly dating from the 13th century, but thought to have been founded sometime in the 7th century. It was restored and re-rendered in 2017.
