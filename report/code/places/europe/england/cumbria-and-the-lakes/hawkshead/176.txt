Tarn Hows | The Lake District, England |  Two miles off the B5285 from Hawkshead, a winding country lane leads to this famously photogenic artificial lake, now owned by the National Trust. Trails wind their way around the lakeshore and surrounding woodland â€“ keep your eyes peeled for red squirrels in the treetops.
There's a small National Trust car park, but it fills quickly. Several buses, including the 505, stop nearby.
