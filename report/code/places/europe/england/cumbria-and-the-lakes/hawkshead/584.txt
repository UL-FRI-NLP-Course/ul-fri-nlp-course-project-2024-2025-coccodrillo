Hawkshead Grammar School | The Lake District, England |  In centuries past, promising young gentlemen were sent to Hawkshead Grammar School for their educational foundation. Among the former pupils was a certain William Wordsworth, who attended the school from 1779 to 1787 â€“ you can still see a desk where the naughty young poet carved his name. The curriculum was punishing: 10 hours' study a day, covering weighty subjects such as Latin, Greek, geometry, science and rhetoric. Upstairs, the museum offers both permanent and changing exhibitions exploring the history of the school.
