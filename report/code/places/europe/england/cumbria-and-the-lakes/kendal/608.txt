Levens Hall | The Lake District, England |  This Elizabethan manor is built around a mid-13th-century fortified pele tower, and fine Jacobean furniture litters its interior, although the real draw is the 17th-century topiary garden â€“ a surreal riot of pyramids, swirls, curls, pompoms and peacocks straight out of Alice in Wonderland.
In 2016 the West Elevation was refaced with traditional lime mortar.The house is 2 miles south from Sizergh Castle along the A6. The 555/556 bus runs past the gates.
