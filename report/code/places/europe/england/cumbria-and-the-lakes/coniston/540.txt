Ruskin Museum | The Lake District, England |  Coniston's little museum explores the village's history, touching on copper mining, Arthur Ransome and the Campbell story. There's also a section on John Ruskin, with displays of his writings, watercolours and sketchbooks. It's also closely connected to the decade-long project to rebuild Donald Campbell's Bluebird K7, with various pieces of the remodelled boat on display; find out more about the project at www.bluebirdproject.com.
The museum is right in the middle of Coniston, just past the Black Bull pub.
