Tynemouth Priory | Northeast England, England |  Built by Benedictine monks on a strategic bluff above the mouth of the Tyne in the 11th-century ruins, Tynemouth Priory was ransacked during the Dissolution in 1539. The military took over for four centuries, only leaving in 1960, and today the ruined remains of the priory church sit alongside old military installations, their guns aimed out to sea at an enemy that never came.
