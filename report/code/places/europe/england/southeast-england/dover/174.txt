Banksy Brexit Mural - removed | Dover, England |  Despite voting leave, the poor port town of Dover was possibly the Southeast community set to suffer most post-Brexit. It was perhaps for that reason that Banksy chose a highly visible gable end to create his Brexit mural that appeared overnight one May weekend in 2017. The huge artwork depicted a workman chipping away at one of the yellow stars of the EU flag, cracks splintering off in all directions across the image. The mural was painted over in September 2019.
