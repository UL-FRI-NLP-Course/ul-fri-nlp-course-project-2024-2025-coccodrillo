Brighton Pier | Brighton & Hove, England |  This grand old Edwardian pier is the place to experience Brighton’s tackier side. There are plenty of stomach-churning fairground rides and noisy amusement arcades to keep you entertained, and candy floss and Brighton rock to chomp on while you’re doing so. Just west are the sad remains of the West Pier, a skeletal iron hulk that attracts flocks of starlings at sunset.
