Fishbourne Roman Palace | Southeast England, England |  Fishbourne Palace is the largest-known Roman residence in Britain. The palace lies 1.5 miles west of Chichester, just off the A259 (take bus 700 from outside Chichester Cathedral). Happened upon by labourers in the 1960s, it’s thought that this once-luxurious mansion was built around AD 75 for a romanised local king. Housed in a modern pavilion are its foundations, hypocaust and painstakingly re-laid mosaics.
The centrepiece is a spectacular floor depicting Cupid riding a dolphin, flanked by sea horses and panthers. There’s also a fascinating little museum and replanted Roman gardens.
