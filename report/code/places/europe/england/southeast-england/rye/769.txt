Church of St Mary the Virgin | Rye, England |  Ryeâ€™s welcoming, community hub of a church is a hotchpotch of medieval and later styles. Its turret clock is the oldest in England (1561) still working with its original pendulum, which swings above your head as you enter. Climb the tower for pretty views of the town and surroundings, then inspect the small exhibition of interesting old objects found in and around the church.
