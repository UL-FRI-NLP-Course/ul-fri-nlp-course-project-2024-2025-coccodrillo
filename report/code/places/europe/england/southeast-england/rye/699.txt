Ypres Tower | Rye, England |  Just off Church Sq stands the sandcastle-esque Ypres Tower (pronounced ‘wipers’). You can scramble through the 13th-century building to learn about its long history as a fort, prison, mortuary and museum (the last two at overlapping times), and an annexe contains one of the last surviving Victorian women’s prisons in the country. From here, there are widescreen views of Rye Bay and even France on very clear days.
