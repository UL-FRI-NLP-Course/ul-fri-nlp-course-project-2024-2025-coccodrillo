The Shambles | York, England |  The Shambles takes its name from the Saxon word shamel, meaning 'slaughterhouse' â€“ in 1862 there were 26 butcher shops on this street. Today the butchers are long gone, but this narrow cobbled lane, lined with 15th-century Tudor buildings that overhang so much they seem to meet above your head, is the most picturesque in Britain, and one of the most visited in Europe, often filled with visitors wielding cameras.
