Barley Hall | York, England |  This restored medieval townhouse, tucked down an alleyway, includes a permanent exhibition of life in the times of Henry VIII. It was once the home of York’s Lord Mayor. The centrepiece is a double-height banquet hall decorated with the Yorkshire rose – peek at it through a window in the alleyway if you don’t want to pay to enter.
To find it head down the alleyway that links Swinegate with the end of Grape Lane.
