Tetley | Leeds, England |  Tetley Brewery's defunct 1930s offices have been converted into a contemporary-arts venue with a restaurant and pub on the ground floor, spilling out onto an outdoor terrace. Upstairs the old meeting rooms have been put to good use as quirky gallery spaces, housing rotating exhibitions from international and local artists and photographers. An immaculately preserved 1930s lift dominates the central stairwell shaft.
