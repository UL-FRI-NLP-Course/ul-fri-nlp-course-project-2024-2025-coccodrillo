Henry Moore Institute | Leeds, England |  Housed in a converted Victorian warehouse in the city centre, this gallery showcases the work of 20th-century sculptors, but not, despite the name, anything by Henry Moore (1898âˆ’1986), who graduated from the Leeds School of Art. To see works by Moore, head to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and Hepworth Wakefield.
