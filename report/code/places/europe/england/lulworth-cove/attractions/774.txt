Fossil Forest | Dorset, England |  A half-mile hike east from Lulworth Cove used to lead to the remains of a Jurassic jungle. Unfortunately, the path has been wiped out by a landslide, and at time of writing access to the forest was closed. The path also cuts through an army firing range: call the Lulworth Cove Heritage Centre for updates on any opening and firing times.
