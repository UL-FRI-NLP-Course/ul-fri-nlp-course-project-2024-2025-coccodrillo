Morgan Motor Company | The Midlands & the Marches, England |  Morgan has been handcrafting elegant sports cars since 1909. You can see the mechanics at work on two-hour guided tours of the unassuming shedlike buildings comprising the factory (prebooking essential), and view a fleet of vintage classics adjacent to the museum. If buying one of these beautiful machines is beyond your budget, it's possible to hire one (per day/weekend/week from Â£220/595/1050, including insurance) for a spin through the Malvern Hills.
