St Mary's Church | The Midlands & the Marches, England |  Crowning the hilltop, pin-straight St Mary's Church is a 13th-century construction with a fine east window and grand alabaster memorials, including the grave of John Kyrle and the outrageously ostentatious tombs of the noble Rudhall family. Behind the church, Royal Pde runs to the edge of the bluff, lined with realistic-looking but ersatz castle ruins, constructed in 1833.
