Buxton Crescent & Thermal Spa | Peak District, England |  In Victorian times, spa activities centred on Buxton's extravagant baths, built in Regency style in 1854 and fronted by the Crescent, a grand, curving facade inspired by the Royal Crescent in Bath. Following extensive works, the complex will reopen in 2019. Alongside a five-star hotel and spa, its pump room, which dispensed the town's spring water for nearly a century, will be the centrepiece of a new visitor attraction, the Pump Room and Crescent Heritage Experience, covering Buxton's spa-town heritage.
