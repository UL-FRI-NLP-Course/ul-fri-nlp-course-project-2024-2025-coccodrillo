Jewry Wall Museum | The Midlands & the Marches, England |  This museum exploring the history of Leicester from Roman times to the modern day was undergoing renovations at the time of writing, and is expected to reopen to the public in spring 2019. In front of the museum is the Jewry Wall, part of Leicester's Roman baths. Tiles and masonry from the baths were incorporated in the walls of neighbouring St Nicholas Church.
