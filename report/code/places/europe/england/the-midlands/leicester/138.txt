King Richard III: Dynasty, Death & Discovery | The Midlands & the Marches, England |  Built following the incredible 2012 discovery and 2013 DNA testing of King Richard III's remains, Leicester's high-tech King Richard III visitor centre encompasses three fascinating sections. Dynasty explores his rise to become the final Plantagenet king. Death delves into the Battle of Bosworth, when Richard became the last English king to be killed in battle. Discovery details the University of Leicesterâ€™s archaeological dig and identification, and lets you view the site of the grave in which he was found.
Its Murder, Mystery and Mayhem exhibition covers the key players, battles and milestones of the Wars of the Roses between the House of York (symbolised by a white rose) and House of Lancaster (red rose).
