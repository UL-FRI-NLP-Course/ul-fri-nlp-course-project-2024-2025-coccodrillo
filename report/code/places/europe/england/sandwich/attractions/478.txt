Sandwich Quay | Kent, England |  Several attractions line the River Stour. The cute little flint-chequered Barbican tollgate was built by Henry VIII and controls traffic flow over the riverâ€™s only road bridge. Nearby rises Fishergate, built in 1384 and once the main entrance to the town, through which goods from the Continent and beyond once passed. On fair-weather days, hop aboard the Sandwich River Bus beside the toll bridge for seal-spotting trips along the River Stour and in Pegwell Bay.
It's also an interesting way to reach the Richborough Roman Fort.
