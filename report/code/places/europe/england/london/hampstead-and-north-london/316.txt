Gasholder Park | North London, London |  Part of the impressive redevelopment of the King's Cross area, this urban green space on Regent's Canal is a masterpiece of regeneration. The cast iron structure was the frame of Gasholder No 8, the largest gas-storage cylinder in the area (originally located across the canal). Carefully renovated, and with the addition of a central lawn, beautiful benches and a mirrored canopy, it has metamorphosed into a gorgeous pocket-sized park.
