Coal Drops Yard | North London, London |  The latest part of post-industrial King's Cross to be regenerated is this double-level shopping and eating arcade, curving its way along the Regent's Canal, just west of Granary Sq. Beautifully restored buildings from the 1850s used to transfer coal from rail wagons to road carts (and, later, â€™80s raves) are now home to independent clothing outlets, a range of restaurants and bars, and changing art installations.
