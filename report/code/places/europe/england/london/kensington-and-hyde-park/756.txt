Holocaust Memorial Garden | Kensington & Hyde Park, London |  This simple marker of stones in a grove of birch trees, a short distance east of the Serpentine in Hyde Park, is a quiet commemoration of those who died in the Holocaust. The largest of the stones is inscribed, in both Hebrew and English, with the words 'For these I weep. Streams of tears flow from my eyes because of the destruction of my people.'
