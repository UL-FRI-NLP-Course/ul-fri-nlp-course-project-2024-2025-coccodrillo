Italian Gardens | Kensington & Hyde Park, London |  The elegant, ornamental Italian Gardens, believed to be a gift from Prince Albert to Queen Victoria, sit at the head of the Long Water, connecting Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Come here in spring for a glorious collection of tulips and photo ops galore among the fountains. The large statue overlooking the ponds is of Edward Jenner, creator of the smallpox vaccine. A cafe stands just north of the water gardens, by Queen Anneâ€™s Alcove.
