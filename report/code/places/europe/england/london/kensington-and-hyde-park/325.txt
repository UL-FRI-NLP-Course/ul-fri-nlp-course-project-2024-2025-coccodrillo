Serpentine Sackler Gallery | Kensington & Hyde Park, London |  This exhibition space is part of the Serpentine Galleries, located within the Magazine, a former Palladian villa–style gunpowder depot dating to 1805, augmented with an undulating extension designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect Zaha Hadid.
The adjoining Chucs is an architecturally amazing place to enjoy some decent Italian food after your gallery perusal.
