Mayfield Lavender | London, England |  With a bright-red London phone box rising surreally up in a sea of purple flowers, Mayfield Lavender is one of the most alluring summer sights around London, drawing visitors from as far as China (in large numbers) and, of course, plenty of buzzy bees. A shop by the gate sells lavender products and a cafe is at hand too.
When to go
Outside the summer season, the field is dormant, then in June it awakens, with July and August the peak flowering season and a sumptuous, glorious blaze of purple. The views as the sun goes down are killer.
