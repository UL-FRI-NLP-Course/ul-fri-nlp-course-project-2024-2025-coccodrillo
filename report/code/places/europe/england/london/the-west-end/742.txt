College Garden | The West End, London |  One of the original gardens within Westminster Abbey, the lovely 900-year-old College Garden was used for growing medicinal herbs and foods for the Abbey's monks. The gardens are free to enjoy and don't require a ticket to the Abbey. If you're not visiting from the church, head to Great College St and then enter Little Deanâ€™s Yard and the Little Cloisters.
