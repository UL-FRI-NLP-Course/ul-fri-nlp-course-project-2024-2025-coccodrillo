Jewel Tower | The West End, London |  Once part of the royal Palace of Westminster, the Jewel Tower is the only surviving piece of the 1834 fire that engulfed the structure, and it's one of the last remaining secular medieval buildings in London. The museum inside detailing the tower's history is ho-hum, but checking out the exterior architecture makes an interesting enough detour after visiting Westminster Abbey or the Houses of Parliament.
