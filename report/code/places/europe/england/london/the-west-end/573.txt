All Souls Church | The West End, London |  Designed by John Nash in golden-hued Bath stone as an eye-catching monument for Regent Street, All Souls features a circular columned porch and a distinctive needle-like spire, reminiscent of an ancient Greek temple. It was bombed extensively during the Blitz and renovated in 1951.
The church was very unpopular when completed in 1824; a contemporary cartoon by George Cruikshank shows Nash rather painfully impaled on the spire through the bottom with the words 'Nashional Taste!!!' below it.
