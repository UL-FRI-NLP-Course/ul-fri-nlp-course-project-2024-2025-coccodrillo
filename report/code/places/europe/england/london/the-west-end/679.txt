Staple Inn | The West End, London |  The half-timbered shopfront facade is the main interest at Staple Inn (1580), the last of eight Inns of Chancery whose functions were superseded by the Inns of Court in the 18th century. The buildings, mostly postwar reconstructions, are now occupied by offices and law chambers and arenâ€™t open to the public, though you can have a look around the courtyard.
