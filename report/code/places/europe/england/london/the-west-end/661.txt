Phoenix Garden | The West End, London |  A tiny patch of wilderness in the heart of Londonâ€™s theatreland, Phoenix Garden is at charming odds with its surrounds. Dotted with small ponds, thick bushes and grassy patches, it provides a haven for both wildlife and people keen to escape the busy surrounding streets. A new garden hosts community events and educational workshops. The garden is managed by a team of volunteers and is a registered charity, its upkeep reliant on donations.
