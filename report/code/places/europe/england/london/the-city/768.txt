St Andrew Holborn | London, England |  First mentioned in the 10th century, St Andrew's was rebuilt by Wren in 1686 and is the largest of his parish churches. The airy interior includes large, clear, arched windows, a vaulted roof with gilded stucco and a mezzanine. Even though the interior was bombed to smithereens during WWII, much of what you see inside today is 17th century as it was brought from other churches.
