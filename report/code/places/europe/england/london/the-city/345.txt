Bank of England Museum | London, England |  This surprisingly interesting museum explores the evolution of money and the history of the venerable Bank of England, founded in 1694 by a Scotsman. Its centrepiece is a reconstruction of architect John Soane’s original Bank Stock Office. Don't miss the chance to get your hands on a hefty 13kg solid-gold bar, worth more than £570,000.
