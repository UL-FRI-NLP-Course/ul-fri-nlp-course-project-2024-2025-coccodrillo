Temperate House | Richmond, Kew & Hampton Court, London |  Built in 1860 and closed for vital restoration work until 2018, the beautiful Temperate House in the southeast of Kew Gardens is the worldâ€™s largest surviving Victorian glasshouse; covering 4880 sq m, it's an astonishing piece of architecture and usually houses an equally sublime collection of plants, including the towering Chilean wine palm.
