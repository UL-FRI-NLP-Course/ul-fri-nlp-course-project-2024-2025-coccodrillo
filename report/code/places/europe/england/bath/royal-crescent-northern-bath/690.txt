Bath Assembly Rooms | Bath, England |  When they opened in 1771, the city's stately Assembly Rooms were where fashionable Bath socialites gathered to waltz, play cards and listen to the latest chamber music. Today they're unfurnished; rooms that are open to the public include the Great Octagon, tearoom and ballroom â€“ all lit by their original 18th-century chandeliers.
The city's fine Fashion Museum is in the basement.
