Pump Room | Bath, England |  The centre of this grand 19th-century room is filled with tables from the Pump Room Restaurant, but there's also an ornate spa fountain from which Bath's famous hot springs flow. Ask staff for a (free) glass; the water tastes of minerals and is startlingly warm at an impressive 38°C (100°F).
The Pump Room is in the same complex as the Roman Baths, but is free to enter.
