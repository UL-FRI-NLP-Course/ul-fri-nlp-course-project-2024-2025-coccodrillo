Speke Hall | Liverpool, England |  A marvellous example of an Elizabethan half-timbered hall, Speke Hall is filled with gorgeously timbered and plastered rooms. The house contains several 'priest's holes', where the hall's sympathetic owners hid Roman Catholic priests during the anti-Catholic 16th and 17th centuries. Speke Hall is about 7.5 miles from central Liverpool; the bus will drop you about 0.62 miles from the entrance.
This diagonally patterned Tudor house dates from 1490â€“1612 and was once surrounded by thousands of acres of land, but these days all that remains is the drive and an oasis of meticulously maintained gardens; the hall's Chapel Farm became the nucleus of nearby Liverpool Airport.The afternoon tours to Paul McCartney's and John Lennon's childhood homes leave from Speke Hall.
