Victoria Baths | Manchester, England |  Designed to be the grandest baths in Britain when they opened in 1906, this Grade IIâ€“listed Edwardian classic retains much of its former grandeur despite being left virtually derelict for more than 30 years. A laborious restoration of its three pools, Turkish bath and the stunning art nouveau decor is underway, and the governing trust runs excellent, hour-long guided tours of the building every Wednesday.
