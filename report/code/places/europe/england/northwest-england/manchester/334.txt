National Football Museum | Manchester, England |  This museum charts the evolution of British football from its earliest days to the multi-billion-pound phenomenon it is today. One of the highlights is Football Plus, a series of interactive stations that allow you to test your skills in simulated conditions; buy a credit (three for £6, eight for £10) and try your luck – it's recommended for kids over seven.
