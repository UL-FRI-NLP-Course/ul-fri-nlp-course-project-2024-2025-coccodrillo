Henry Blogg Museum | Norfolk, England |  Tap out a message in Morse and spell your name in semaphore flags – hands-on gizmos add to the appeal of this excellent museum, as do the well-told tales of brave sea rescues and the WWII lifeboat sitting proudly inside.
The museum is named after one of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution’s most decorated coxswains, and features accounts of his extraordinary rescues.
