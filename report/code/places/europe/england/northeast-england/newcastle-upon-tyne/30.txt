Life Science Centre | Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England |  Part of a sober-minded institute devoted to the study of genetic science, this centre lets you discover the secrets of life through a fascinating series of hands-on exhibits. There are lots of thought-provoking arcade-style games, and if the information sometimes gets lost on the way, never mind, kids will love it. Book ahead at busy times.
Mornings on school days see it filled with groups; visit after 2pm to avoid the crowds.
