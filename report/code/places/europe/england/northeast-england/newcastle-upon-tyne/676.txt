Bessie Surtees House | Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England |  The Tyne's northern bank was the hub of commercial Newcastle in the 16th century and on Sandhill a row of leaning merchant houses has survived from that era. One of them is Bessie Surtees House, where an exhibition on the 1st floor is open to the public. The daughter of a wealthy banker, feisty Bessie annoyed Daddy by falling in love with pauper John Scott (1751â€“1838). It all ended in smiles as John went on to become Lord Chancellor.
