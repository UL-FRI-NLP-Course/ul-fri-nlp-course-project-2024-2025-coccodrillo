Symonds Yat Rock | Oxford & the Cotswolds, England |  Soaring 504m high above Symonds Yat East, this limestone outcrop has outstanding wraparound views of the River Wye and the surrounding countryside. It's a favourite spot for birdwatchers; you may be lucky enough to spot the resident pair of peregrine falcons as they whoosh by the drop-off. Walk up from Symonds Yat East, and youâ€™ll find a kiosk atop the rock selling drinks and snacks. Peaceful walking trails continue east through the forest.
