Great St Mary's Church | Cambridge, England |  The foundations of Cambridge's sublime university church date from 1010. It was burnt to the ground in the 1290s and rebuilt in 1351. The major expansion of 1478–1519 resulted in the late-Gothic Perpendicular style you see today. Striking features include the mid-Victorian stained-glass windows, seating galleries and two organs – unusual in a church. The tower (adult/child £4/2.50) was added in 1690; climb it for superb vistas of Cambridge’s dreamy spires.
