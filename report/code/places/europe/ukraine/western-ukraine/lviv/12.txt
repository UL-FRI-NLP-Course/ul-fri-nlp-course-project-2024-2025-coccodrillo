Ratusha | Lviv, Ukraine |  The city fathers have occupied this location since the 14th century, but the present-day Italianate look dates to 1835. In a sign of openness and transparency, visitors are allowed to roam the corridors of power, but most of them do so on the arduous climb (305 steps from the 4th-floor ticket office) of the 65m-tall tower that looms over the Rynok.
Noon is marked with a bugle call from one of the balconies on the southern side of the building.
