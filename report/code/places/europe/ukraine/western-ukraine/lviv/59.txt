Bernardine Church and Monastery | Lviv, Ukraine |  Lviv's most stunning baroque interior belongs to the 17th-century now Greek Catholic Church of St Andrew, part of the Bernadine Monastery. Populated with an army of cherubs and peppered with sunbursts, it's been painstakingly restored to its former splendour. There are usually more tourists here than worshippers, except on Sundays when mass draws the locals to prayer.
