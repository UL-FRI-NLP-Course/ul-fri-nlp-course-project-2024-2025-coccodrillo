Apteka Museum | Lviv, Ukraine |  This fascinating pharmacy museum is located inside a still-functioning chemist's shop dating from 1735. Buy a ticket from the pharmacist and head down into the pidval (cellar) via rooms filled with still medicinally aromatic amphorae, pestles, scales, pill-processing machines and old medicines from pre-WWII Lviv. The damp and musty cellars holds further exhibitions on medicinal themes.
