Ivan Honchar Museum | Kyiv, Ukraine |  This Pechersk-based facility is more than a museum, it's a crucible for preserving Ukrainian folk culture in the 21st century. In addition to permanent ethnographic exhibits of clothing, textiles, musical instruments, pysanky (decorative Easter eggs) and the like, they hold bold exhibitions that blend modern and traditional art and/or fashion, plus run well-regarded workshops on costume design, folk art and national song.
