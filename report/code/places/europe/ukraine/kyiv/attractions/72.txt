Taras Shevchenko Memorial House Museum | Kyiv, Ukraine |  A beautifully restored, 19th-century wooden house where the man who dominates the Ukrainian literary pantheon once lived. You can see drawings he made on ethnological expeditions of Ukraine, which inspired his nationalism. Do have a stroll around the attractive grounds and gardens at the back.
