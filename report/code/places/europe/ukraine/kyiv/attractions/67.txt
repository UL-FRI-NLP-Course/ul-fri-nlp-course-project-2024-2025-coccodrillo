Former Lenin Statue | Kyiv, Ukraine |  At the terminus of vul Tarasa Shevchenka once stood Kyiv's last Lenin statue, famously pulled down and smashed to bits by Euromaidan protesters in late 2013. Until his demise, Lenin looked across thundering vul Khreshchatyk to the wonderfully atmospheric Bessarabsky Rynok.
