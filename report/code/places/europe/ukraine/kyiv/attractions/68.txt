Water Museum | Kyiv, Ukraine |  The Dutch funded the launch of this museum inside a 1980s water pump, but it now operates independently. On the obligatory 45-minute tour (in English by request), you're taken on a walk through a rainwater collector, allowed to sit on a giant toilet or stand inside a bubble, and introduced to a yellow fish called Vasily. Good for children.
