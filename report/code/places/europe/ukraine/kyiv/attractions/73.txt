Chocolate House | Kyiv, Ukraine |  This distinctive neo-Renaissance mansion in Kyiv's wealthy Lypky district, built in 1901, is notable for its lavish interiors. There's a small sculpture display inside, but mostly it's about viewing the palatial rooms with their meticulously carved Moorish ceilings and chandeliers.
