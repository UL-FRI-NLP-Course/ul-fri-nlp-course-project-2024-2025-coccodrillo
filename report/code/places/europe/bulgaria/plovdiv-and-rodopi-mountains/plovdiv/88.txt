Ruins of Eumolpias | Plovdiv, Bulgaria |  Some 203m high in the old town, a hill with spectacular views reveals sparse ruins of Eumolpias, a Thracian settlement in 5000 BC. The fortress and surrounding town enjoyed a strategic position, later bolstered by Macedonians, Romans, Byzantines, Bulgarians and Turks, who named it Nebet Tepe (Prayer Hill).
Reach it from ul Dr Chomakov (the continuation of ul SÃ¢borna). Partially restored remains of a 13th-century reservoir are also here.
