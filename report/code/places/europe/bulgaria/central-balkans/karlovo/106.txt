Vasil Levski Museum | Bulgaria, Europe |  This 18th-century house is the childhood home of Bulgaria's handsomest revolutionary hero, Vasil Levski. Rooms around a pleasant cobblestoned courtyard contain exhibits about the life of Bulgaria's 'freedom apostle', with some English explanation. A guide will usher you into the shrine, built in 2000, where a lock of Levskiâ€™s hair is displayed while Bulgarian religious chants waft on the air.
