Sveti Sveti Pet√¢r & Pavel Church | Bulgaria, Europe |  This pretty pink church was built in the 1860s and is adorned with bright modern murals. It houses relics of a 4th-century local saint, Dasius, which were stolen by medieval crusaders and were only returned to the church by the Pope in 2001, after spending several centuries in Italy. The church is to the north towards the river from the Archaeological Museum.
