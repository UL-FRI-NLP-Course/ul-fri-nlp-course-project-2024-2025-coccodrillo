Nikopolis-ad-Istrum | Bulgaria, Europe |  The broken remains of a Roman 'victory city', built in AD 110, cover this isolated site, 20km north of Veliko Târnovo. Nikopolis-ad-Istrum's foundations were laid by Emperor Trajan after a successful battle against the Dacians. Destroyed by Slavs in the late 6th century, the city experienced a brief period of resettlement in the 9th century, after which it slumbered for centuries. Its ruins, including streets, towers, gates, a city square and town hall, were discovered in 1871.
