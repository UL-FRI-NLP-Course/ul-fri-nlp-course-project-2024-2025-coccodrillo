St Anastasia Island | Burgas, Bulgaria |  This small volcanic island makes for a fun day of exploring. The island, which has served as a religious retreat, a prison and pirate bait (according to legend, a golden treasure is buried in its sands), is today dominated by a lighthouse and a monastery, where visitors can sample various healing herb potions. At least two (and usually more) ships leave daily from May to October from the passenger ferry terminal south of the bus and train stations.
