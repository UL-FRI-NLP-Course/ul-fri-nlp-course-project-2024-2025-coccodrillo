Ivan Vazov House-Museum | Sofia, Bulgaria |  Bulgaria’s best-loved author, Ivan Vazov (1850–1921) lived at this house from 1895 until his death. Vazov wrote Under the Yoke, a classic of Bulgarian literature based around the 1876 April Uprising against the Turks. Several rooms have been restored to their early 20th-century appearance and you can even meet Vazov’s beloved pet dog, Bobby, now stuffed.
