Yuzhen Park | Sofia, Bulgaria |  South of the city centre, Yuzhen Park is a vast, wild green sprawl, filled with trees and shady pathways. A sparkling stream bubbles through it, and there is a handful of discreet bars and cafes that are not always easy to find. Itâ€™s a satisfying place to get lost in and explore for yourself.
