Royal Palace | Sofia, Bulgaria |  Originally built as the headquarters of the Ottoman police force, this is where Bulgaria’s national hero Vasil Levski was tried and tortured before his public execution in 1873. After the liberation, the building was remodelled to become the official residence of Bulgaria’s royal family. It now houses the Ethnographical Museum.
