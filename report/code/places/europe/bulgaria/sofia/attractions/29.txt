Peyo Yavorov House-Museum | Sofia, Bulgaria |  The Romantic poet and revolutionary Peyo Yavorov (1878–1914) briefly lived in a small apartment here; the three rooms have been restored to their original appearance, while ghoulish mementoes include Yavorov’s death mask and the dress Yavorov’s wife, Lora, was wearing when she killed herself in the study. Ring the doorbell for admittance.
