Meerschaum Gallery | Eskişehir, Türkiye |  Inside the Kurşunlu Külliyesi Complex, this small gallery displays items made from meerschaum stone, which is mined locally. Meerschaum pipes are famous among pipe-smokers worldwide and their unique carved shapes make them highly collectable. The exhibit cases run along the wall, while small handicraft stalls have set up home in the arched cells opposite.
