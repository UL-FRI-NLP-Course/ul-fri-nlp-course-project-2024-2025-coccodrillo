Kuğulu Parkı | Ankara, Türkiye |  At the southern end of Tunalı Hilmi Caddesi, Kuğulu Parkı is a leafy oasis with a fountain-spouting pond ringed by cafes and garden beds of pansies. On sunny weekends, it gets crammed with park-goers lazing on the grass.For travelling families, there's a decent children's playground at the park's northern end though note that the playground surface is concrete.
