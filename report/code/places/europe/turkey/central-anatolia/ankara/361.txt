Rahmi M Koç Industrial Museum | Ankara, Türkiye |  The surprisingly absorbing Rahmi M Koç Industrial Museum, located inside the beautifully restored Çengelhan caravanserai building, has three floors covering subjects as diverse as transport, science, music, computing, Atatürk and carpets. If you were born before about 1985, be prepared to feel old as childhood memories such as ZX Spectrum computers and cassette tapes are worthy of museum exhibit status here.
