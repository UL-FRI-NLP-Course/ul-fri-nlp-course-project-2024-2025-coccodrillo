Alaettin Cami | Ankara, TÃ¼rkiye |  The Alaettin Cami is the oldest mosque in Ankara, dating from the 12th century, but has been extensively rebuilt. Another full restoration was ongoing in 2019 with mid-2020 pegged for the finishing date. Before restoration, the mosque was usually kept locked so fingers crossed that the current work results in the mosque being opened again.
