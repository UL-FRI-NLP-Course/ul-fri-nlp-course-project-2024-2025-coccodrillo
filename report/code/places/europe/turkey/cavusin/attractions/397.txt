Church of St John the Baptist | Cappadocia, Türkiye |  Right at the top of Çavuşin's village ruins rock outcrop is the Church of St John the Baptist, one of the oldest churches in Cappadocia. While the interior frescoes are severely damaged and faded, the still-standing columns inside the cavern are impressive and the views across the countryside from the church entry are sublime.
