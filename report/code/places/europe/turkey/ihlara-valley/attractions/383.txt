Direkli Kilise | Cappadocia, Türkiye |  This cross-shaped church has four columns, with lovely partially preserved frescoes of saints. The large adjoining chamber originally had two storeys, as you can see from what's left of the steps and the holes in the walls from the supporting beams. It's in Belisırma village, off the main Ihlara Valley trail; a sign near the Belisırma trailhead ticket booth points the way to the entry.
