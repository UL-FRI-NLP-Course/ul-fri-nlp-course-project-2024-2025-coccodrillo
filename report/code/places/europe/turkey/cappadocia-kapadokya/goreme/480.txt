Sandal Church | Göreme, Türkiye |  This 13th-century church has frescoes depicting the four gospel writers (below the central dome) and the Betrayal of Judas (in the arch over the door). The church's moniker comes from the footprints marked in the floor, representing the last imprints left by Jesus before he ascended to heaven.
