Özlüce Underground City | Cappadocia, Türkiye |  To reach Özlüce underground city, turn right as you enter Kaymaklı village from the north and you'll be heading for the small village of Özlüce, 7km further away. Much more modest than the caves of Kaymaklı or Derinkuyu, this underground city is also much less developed and less crowded.
