Çınarlı Cami | Ayvalık, Türkiye |  Built in 1790 as the Greek Orthodox church of Ayios Yorgis and converted to a mosque in 1923, this lovely building has three naves and three apses and retains the soaring stone iconostasis that once separated the nave from the chancel. Sadly, its icons have long since been removed. The mosque is also known as the Alibey Cami.
