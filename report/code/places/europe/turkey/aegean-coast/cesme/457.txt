Statue of Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Paşa | Çeşme, Türkiye |  Facing the sea, with its back to the fortress, this statue shows the great Ottoman admiral (1713–90), who was sold into slavery but became a grand vizier and was fleet commander during the Battle of Çeşme against the Russians. He is shown accompanied by his pet lion, which he supposedly brought back from Africa.
