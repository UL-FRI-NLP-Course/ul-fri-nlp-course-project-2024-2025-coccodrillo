Kuşadası Castle | Kuşadası, Türkiye |  Kuşadası's small, picturesque Byzantine fortress stands on the causeway-connected Güvercin Adası (Pigeon Island) and has recently been renovated. It's now part of a popular and well-kept public park. A path winds around the island past excellent information boards and a small lighthouse, providing fine views of Kuşadası. Inside the fortress there's a skeleton of a 14.5m fin whale and a few models of sailing boats.
