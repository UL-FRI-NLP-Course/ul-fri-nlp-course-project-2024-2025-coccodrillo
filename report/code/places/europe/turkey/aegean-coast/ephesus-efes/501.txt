Temple of Serapis | Ephesus, TÃ¼rkiye |  This massive structure, reached by a flight of marble steps in the southwest corner of the Lower Agora, may have contained a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god of grain. Egypt was one of the granaries of ancient Rome and Alexandria and Ephesus had close commercial links.
