Kızlarağası Hanı | İzmir, Türkiye |  This restored Ottoman-built bedesten (warehouse) dates from 1744 and is similar to the İç (Inner) Bedesten in İstanbul's famous Grand Bazaar. It's touristy, with most items for sale harking from the far end of the Silk Road (China), but the building itself – which also functioned as a kervansaray (caravansarai) in its heyday – is extremely handsome.
