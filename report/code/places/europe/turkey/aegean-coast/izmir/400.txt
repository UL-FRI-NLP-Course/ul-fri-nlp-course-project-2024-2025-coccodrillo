Havra Sokağı | İzmir, Türkiye |  One of Kemeraltı's most interesting pockets, this stretch of produce stalls links the centre of the bazaar with the Agora and the eastern stretch of Anafartalar Caddesi. Locals head here to purchase fresh fish, fruit and vegetables, olives and helva (sweet made with sesame seeds). It takes its name from the many historic synagogues in the immediate area.
