Hisar Mosque | İzmir, Türkiye |  Surrounded by popular coffeehouses, this mosque in the Kemeraltı Market is the largest in the city and dates from 1597. The interior is quintessentially İzmiri, with blue-and-gold motifs on the domed ceiling that are simpler and less Oriental than classic Ottoman designs. Also of note are the roses and grapes carved along the bottom of the women’s gallery.
