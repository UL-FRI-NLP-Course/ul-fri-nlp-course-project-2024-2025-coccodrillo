Bodrum Maritime Museum | Bodrum Town, Türkiye |  This small but well-formed museum spread over two floors examines Bodrum's maritime past through finely crafted scale models of boats and an excellent video on traditional 'Bodrum-type’ boat building. Much is made of Bodrum's role as a sponge-diving centre and local writer Cevat Şakir Kabaağaçlı – the much-loved ’Fisherman of Halicarnassus'.
Conchologists of whatever hue will be in seventh heaven here. A private collection of some 6000 shells representing one third of all mollusc families is on shimmering display upstairs.
