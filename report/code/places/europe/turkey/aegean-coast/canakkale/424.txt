Trojan Horse | Çanakkale, Türkiye |  Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 movie Troy had a big impact on the Çanakkale region, including boosting visitor numbers to the archaeological site and endowing the northern stretch of the waterfront promenade with this wooden horse, which was used in the film shoot. There are information displays and a model of the ancient city underneath.
