Kent Müzesi | Çanakkale, Türkiye |  The lives of Çanakkale's residents since Ottoman times are the focus of this small museum, which has drawn on oral histories for the content of many of its display panels. There are photographs, newspaper articles and a few artefacts on show. Ask for the English-translation texts to get the most out of the exhibitions.
