Çukur Han | İzmir & the North Aegean, Türkiye |  This 14th-century caravanserai in the historic Ottoman bazaar originally had 28 rooms that once provided accommodation for traders and their caravans of goods and animals. The lower floor was a depot, barn and workplace, while the traders ate and slept upstairs.
