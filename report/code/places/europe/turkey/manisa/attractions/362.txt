Medical History Museum | İzmir & the North Aegean, Türkiye |  Tracing the history of medicine across the globe, this ambitious museum in the grounds of the Sultan Mosque occupies a handsome bimarhane (mental hospital) that was commissioned by Süleyman the Magnificent in 1539 as part of the külliye (mosque complex). Run by Celal Bayar Üniversitesi, its exhibitions are fascinating but sometimes quite gruesome. There's a pleasant cafe in the courtyard.
