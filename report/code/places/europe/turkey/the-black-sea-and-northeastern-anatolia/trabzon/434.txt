Kanuni Park | Trabzon, Türkiye |  One of Trabzon's most charming corners, this little park falls within the fortress walls of Ortahısar. It is ringed by fine old buildings including a cultural centre, literary museum, a mosque that was once a church and a statue of Sultan Selim on a rearing horse.
The culture centre's cafe serves tea in the gardens for just ₺1.
