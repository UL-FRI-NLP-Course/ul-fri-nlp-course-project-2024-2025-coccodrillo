Taş Han | Trabzon, Türkiye |  Typical of the Ottoman caravanserais of its time (1533), Taş Han was built in two storeys around an open courtyard. Today most of the spaces inside are used as tailors' workshops and the entrance is easily missed; it's opposite the Bulutoğlu Köfte restaurant.
At night, the heavy, ancient door swings shut but is often unlocked so you can still peep inside.
