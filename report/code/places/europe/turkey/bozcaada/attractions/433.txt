Bozcaada Castle | İzmir & the North Aegean, Türkiye |  It is generally thought that Bozcaada’s colossal fortress dates to Byzantine times, but it has been significantly rebuilt by the Venetians, Genoese and Ottomans. Over the dry moat and within the double walls are traces of a mosque, ammunition stores, a barracks, an infirmary and Roman pillars. It sits right next to the ferry terminal.
