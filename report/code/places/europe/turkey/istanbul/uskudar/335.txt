Şemsi Ahmed Paşa Mosque | Istanbul, Türkiye |  This charming mosque complex on the waterfront was designed by Mimar Sinan and built in 1580 for one of Süleyman the Magnificent's grand viziers, Şemsi Ahmed Paşa. It is modest in size and decoration, reflecting the fact that its benefactor (whose tomb has an opening into the mosque) only occupied the position of grand vizier for a couple of months.
The çay bahçesis (tea gardens) next to the mosque have wonderful water views.
