Mihrimah Sultan Mosque | Istanbul, Türkiye |  Sometimes called the İskele (Dock) Camii, this mosque was designed by Mimar Sinan for Süleyman the Magnificent's daughter Mihrimah. Built between 1547 and 1548, it was the first mosque in which Sinan used his trademark semi-domes. Look out for its attractive baroque-style ablutions fountain in the traffic island; this dates from 1728.
