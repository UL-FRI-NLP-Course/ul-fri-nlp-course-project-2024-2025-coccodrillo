Marmara University Republican Museum | Sultanahmet, Istanbul |  Located at the southern end of the Hippodrome, this museum is housed in a handsome example of Ottoman Revivalism, a homegrown architectural style popular in the late 19th century. On display is the university's collection of original Turkish prints and etchings from the 1920s to the present day, including work by İhap Hulusi Görey, who introduced coloured posters to Turkey.
