Sublime Porte | Sultanahmet, Istanbul |  This outrageously curvaceous rococo gate leads into the precincts of what was once the grand vizierate, or Ottoman prime ministry, known in the West as the Sublime Porte thanks to this flamboyant entrance. Today the buildings beyond the gate hold various offices of the Ä°stanbul provincial government (the Vilayetler).
