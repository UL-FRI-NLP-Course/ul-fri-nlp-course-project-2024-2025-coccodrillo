Mihrişah Valide Sultan Complex | Istanbul, Türkiye |  Commissioned by Mihrişah Valide Sultan, mother of Sultan Selim III, this late-18th-century complex includes a baroque-style türbe (tomb), medrese (seminary) and sebil (fountain). Its centrepiece is a magnificent imaret (soup kitchen) built around a courtyard, which was under restoration at the time of research.
