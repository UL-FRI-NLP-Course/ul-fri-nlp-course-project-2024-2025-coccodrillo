Valide Sultan Mosque | Istanbul, Türkiye |  Commissioned by Pertevniyal Valide Sultan, mother of Abdül Aziz, and built between 1869 and 1872, this architectural hodgepodge of a building has been hemmed in by roads and flyovers in recent times, making it the least attractive of the city's imperial mosques.
