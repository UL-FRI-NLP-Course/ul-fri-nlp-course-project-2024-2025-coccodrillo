Vezir Han | Istanbul, Türkiye |  One of the many hans (caravanserais) in the Bazaar District, this huge structure was built between 1659 and 1660 by the Köprülüs, a distinguished Ottoman family. Five of its members served as Grand Vizier (vezir) to the sultan, hence its name. Though gold manufacturers still work here, the han is in a sadly dilapidated state. Look for the tuğra (monogram) of the sultan over the main gateway.
