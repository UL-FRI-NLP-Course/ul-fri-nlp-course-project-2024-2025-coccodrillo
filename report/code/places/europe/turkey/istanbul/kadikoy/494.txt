Aya Efimia Rum Ortodoks Kilisesi | Kadıköy, Istanbul |  This Greek Orthodox church dates from 1830, although there had been a previous church on the same site from the late 17th century. Legend tells us that St Euphemia was a local Christian who, in the 3rd century AD, was tortured and murdered for refusing to pray to a pagan god.
