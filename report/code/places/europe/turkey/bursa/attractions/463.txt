Murat I (Hüdavendigâr) Cami | Bursa, Türkiye |  This unusual mosque from 1366 features a barrel-vaulted Ottoman T-square design, and includes ground-floor zaviye (dervish hostel) rooms. The only visible part of the 2nd-floor facade gallery, originally a medrese (seminary), is the sultan's loge (box), above the mosque's rear.
