Emir Han | Bursa, TÃ¼rkiye |  Camel caravans travelling the Silk Road to Bursa once lodged at Emir Han, entered at the rear of Ulu Cami. Drovers and merchants slept and did business upstairs, with their precious cargo stored in the ground-floor rooms. The courtyard tea garden has a fine old fountain.
