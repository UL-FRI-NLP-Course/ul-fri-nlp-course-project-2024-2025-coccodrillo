Koza Han | Bursa, Türkiye |  The finely restored Koza Han, with its leafy inner courtyard filled with cafes, is the most popular place to break your market explorations. The surrounding chambers where traders once bunked down for the night are now home to expensive silk shops. The han (caravanserai) was built in 1490 and its small courtyard mosque (1491) honours Yıldırım Beyazıt.
