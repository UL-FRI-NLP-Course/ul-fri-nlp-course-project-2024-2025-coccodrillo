Nek | Gallipoli Peninsula, TÃ¼rkiye |  On the morning of 7 August 1915, the 8th (Victorian) and 10th (Western Australian) Regiments of the third Light Horse Brigade vaulted out of their trenches at the Nek and into withering fire. They were cut down before they reached the enemy line. This episode was immortalised in Peter Weir's 1981 film Gallipoli.
