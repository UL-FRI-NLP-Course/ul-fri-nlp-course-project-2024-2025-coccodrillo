Paşaoğlu Mansion & Ethnography Museum | Black Sea Coast, Türkiye |  Occupying a handsome stone mansion built in 1896, this ethnographic museum provides a glimpse into the life of upper-class Ottoman society, before it all came to an end in the early 20th century.
The beautiful high-ceilinged interior contains displays of weapons, costumes and a sand-needle embroidery of Atatürk, who visited in 1924. It's 500m southwest (and uphill) from the main square.
