Hadrian's Gate | Antalya, Türkiye |  Commonly known as Üçkapılar (the 'Three Gates') in Antalya, the monumental Hadrian's Gate was erected for the Roman emperor's visit to Antalya in AD 130. Flanked by defence towers and city walls, it forms the principal entrance to Kaleiçi from the east of the city. Built in marble and granite, it originally had a second story and was double the height you see today.
