Temples of Apollo & Athena | Side, TÃ¼rkiye |  This compact site is one of the most romantic on the Mediterranean coast. Apollo and Athena were Side's deities, although Apollo eventually became more important. The Temple of Athena dates from the 2nd century BC, and a half-dozen columns have been placed upright in their original spots with a frieze of Medusa heads.
This is prime sunset-photography territory, and after dark a spotlight dramatically picks out the ruins.
