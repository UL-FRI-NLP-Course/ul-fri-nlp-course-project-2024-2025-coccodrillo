Tomb of Amyntas | Fethiye, Türkiye |  Fethiye’s most recognisable sight is the mammoth Tomb of Amyntas, an Ionic temple facade carved into a sheer rock face in 350 BC, in honour of 'Amyntas son of Hermapias’. Located south of the centre, it is best visited at sunset. Other smaller rock tombs lie about 500m to the east. Unfortunately there's a lot of graffiti evident at the site.
