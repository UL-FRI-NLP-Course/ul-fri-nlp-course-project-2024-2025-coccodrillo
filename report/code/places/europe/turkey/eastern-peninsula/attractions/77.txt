ARThill | Bodrum Peninsula, TÃ¼rkiye |  Painter and sculptor Ender Guzey established this unique space in a remote hillside location east of Bodrum, showcasing contemporary art and (occasional) music performances in a landmark modernist structure. The quality of exhibits here is superb. It's quite tricky to find, 15km east of Bodrum, and cannot be accessed by public transport.
