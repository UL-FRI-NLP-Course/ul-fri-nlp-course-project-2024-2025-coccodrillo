Kızıl Kilise | Cappadocia, Türkiye |  Against a backdrop of stark, sweeping fields, the red masonry of the Kızıl Kilise stands out for miles. One of Cappadocia's oldest churches, it was built in the 5th or 6th century and dedicated to St Gregory of Nazianzus. It's 8km out of Güzelyurt on the Niğde road, just past the village of Sivrihisar.
