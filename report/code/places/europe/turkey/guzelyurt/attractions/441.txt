Yüksek Kilise & Manastır | Cappadocia, Türkiye |  This religious complex is perched high on a rock overlooking Güzelyurt lake, some 2km south of a signposted turn-off on the Ihlara road 1km west of Güzelyurt. The walled compound containing the plain church and monastery is graffitied inside and looks more impressive from afar but has sweeping views of the lake and mountains.
