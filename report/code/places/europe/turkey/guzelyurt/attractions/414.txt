Güzelyurt Underground City | Cappadocia, Türkiye |  Entry into this underground city is beside the Monastery Valley ticket office. The restored complex ranges across several levels and includes one hair-raising section where you descend through a hole in the floor. There is also a small, uninteresting satellite of the underground city about 100m back up the road.
