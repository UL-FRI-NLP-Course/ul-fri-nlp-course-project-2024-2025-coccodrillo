Oandu Nature Centre | Lahemaa National Park, Estonia |  Housed in a 19th-century forestry office, with displays on Lahemaa's flora and fauna, outdoor exhibits including a plant trail, hay barn and ice-cellar and several walking routes snaking out into the forest, this little pine-shaded complex is part-museum, part-visitor centre.
