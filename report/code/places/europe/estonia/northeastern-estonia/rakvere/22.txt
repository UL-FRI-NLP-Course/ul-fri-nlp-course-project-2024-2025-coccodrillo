Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God | Estonia, Europe |  This cute 19th-century church was originally a two-storey house, bought by Tsar Nicholas I in 1839 to provide a house of worship for Rakvere's Orthodox community. Its gilded onion domes are a landmark for pilgrims come to view the relics of St Sergius, a local priest shot by communists in 1918, and now a martyr of the Russian Orthodox Church.
