Citizen’s House Museum | Estonia, Europe |  There are many historic wooden and stone buildings on Pikk street, including this 18th-century home, restored and furnished to reflect Rakvere town life in the early 20th century. Displays include a bourgeois parlour, a cobbler’s workshop, a collection of children’s toys and a piano that once belonged to Estonian composer Arvo Pärt (who hails from these parts).
