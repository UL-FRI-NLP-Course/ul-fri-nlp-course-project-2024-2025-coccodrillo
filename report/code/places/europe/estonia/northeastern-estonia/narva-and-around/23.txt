Alexander Church | Estonia, Europe |  Named after the Russian tsar assassinated while it was being built (1881â€“84), this Lutheran church is the largest religious building in Estonia. It was badly damaged in both of the world wars and the hefty octagonal bell tower was only rebuilt post independence from the USSR. It now serves as Narva's Lutheran cathedral.
