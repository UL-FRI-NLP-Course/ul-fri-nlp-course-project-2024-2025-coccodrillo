Valaste juga | Estonia, Europe |  At Valaste a viewing platform and metal stair faces Estoniaâ€™s highest waterfall (varying from 26m to 30m), which, depending on the month, may be a torrent, a mere trickle or photogenically frozen. If you need to stretch your legs, there's a pleasant 1.5km trail through klint forest and along the beach, with boardwalks and information on the geology and biology of the Ontika Landscape Reserve.
