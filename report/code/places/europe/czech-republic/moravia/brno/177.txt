Moravian Museum | Brno, Czechia |  This natural history and ethnographic museum holds some six million pieces and is the country's second-largest. Exhibits straddle the gulf between extinct life and the medieval village, though the lack of English signage limits the appeal. In the courtyard next to the museum is the Bishop's Court, housing a small aquarium and info on Moravian wildlife.
