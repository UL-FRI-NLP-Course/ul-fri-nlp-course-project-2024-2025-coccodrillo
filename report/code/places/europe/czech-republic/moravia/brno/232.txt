Ossuary at St James | Brno, Czechia |  This ghoulish 20-minute tour through the former burial grounds and crypts below the Church of St James displays the collected bones and remains of some 50,000 people who perished from wars, famines and plagues over the centuries. The remains were discovered in 2001 during the renovation of the square and opened to the public in 2013.
