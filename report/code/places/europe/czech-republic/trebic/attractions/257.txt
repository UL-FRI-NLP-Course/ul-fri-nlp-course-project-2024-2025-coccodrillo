St Procopius' Basilica | Moravia, Czechia |  There was a chapel on this site way back in the early 12th century, when the church was connected to a Benedictine monastery. Although the church has been remodelled many times since then, parts still show signs of the Gothic renovation the structure received in 1260. Today it's a Unesco World Heritage Site.
