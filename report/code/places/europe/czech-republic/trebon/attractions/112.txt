Rybník Svět | Bohemia, Czechia |  This is one of hundreds of fish ponds in the region that date back centuries to when this part of Bohemia first developed fish-raising and harvesting techniques. Marked trails will lead you around the lake and to other similar fish ponds in the region.
A leisurely 12km route runs around Rybník Svět on a well-marked trail (around four hours), beginning just south of the Regent Brewery. The trail is flagged with 16 information boards in Czech, German and English; ask at the Tourist Information Centre for a map.
