Dům Štěpánka Netolického | Bohemia, Czechia |  This renovated Renaissance townhouse on the main square was once home to legendary fish-pond builder Štěpánek Netolický and houses an interactive exhibition on the town's fish-pond heritage. English signage is spotty, though the building itself is fascinating and the computer-driven exhibitions succeed in conveying the remarkable engineering skills required in the 15th century to build a pond.
