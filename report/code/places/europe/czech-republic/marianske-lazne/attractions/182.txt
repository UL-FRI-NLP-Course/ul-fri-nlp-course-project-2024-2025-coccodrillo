Colonnade | Bohemia, Czechia |  The cast-iron Colonnade, built in neo-baroque style in 1889, is the spa's visual centrepiece. Classical and brass-band concerts are performed here two or three times a day in the high season. Also here, in its own pavilion, is the Cross Spring (Křížový pramen), the spa's first spring. Choose from a galaxy of souvenir porcelain mugs or bring along a plastic bottle.
