Holy Hill | Moravia, Czechia |  To reach the 363m peak of Holy Hill, take the 1km path through a nature reserve and past grottoes depicting the Stations of the Cross to the compact Church of St Sebastian. The blue-marked trail begins at the bottom of the main square on Svobody. The whitewashed church and the limestone on the hill give it a Mediterranean ambience.
