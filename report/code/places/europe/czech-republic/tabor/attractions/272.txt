Haunted Underground | Bohemia, Czechia |  Descend into the medieval cellar of a 500-year-old town house to find a spooky netherworld of vampires, ghosts, alchemists and mummies. The atmosphere is undeniably scary and will frighten the bejeebers out of small children, but is perfectly suitable for older kids, teens and adults.
