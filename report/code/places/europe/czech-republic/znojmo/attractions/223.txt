Church of St Nicholas | Moravia, Czechia |  This beautiful 13th-century church was originally Romanesque and was rebuilt in Gothic style. Towards the front on the right-hand side is the 'Bread Madonna' chapel. According to legend, during the Thirty Years' War a box beneath the image was always found to be full of food. Beside the church is the small St Wenceslas Chapel (kaple sv VÃ¡clava).
