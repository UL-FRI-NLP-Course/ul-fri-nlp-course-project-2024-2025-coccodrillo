Rotunda of Our Lady & St Catherine | Moravia, Czechia |  This 11th-century church is one of the republic's oldest Romanesque structures and contains a beautiful series of 12th-century frescoes depicting the life of Christ. Because of the sensitive nature of the frescoes, visitors are limited to groups of 10 or fewer, and are allowed in for 15 minutes at a time twice per hour (at quarter to and quarter past the hour).
