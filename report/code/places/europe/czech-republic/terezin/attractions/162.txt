Terezín Transports | Bohemia, Czechia |  This small but fascinating exhibition in the town's former weighing office opened in 2020 to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Photographs and documents tell the harrowing story of the WWII-era transports to extermination camps throughout Eastern Europe, including to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where tens of thousands of Terezín prisoners were eventually murdered.
