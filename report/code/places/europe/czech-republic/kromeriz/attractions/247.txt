Flower Garden | Moravia, Czechia |  This 17th-century baroque garden is managed by the Archbishopâ€™s Chateau, but is located on the opposite side of town, about a 15-minute walk west of the chateau. The appeal here is an immaculately kept formal garden. The main sights are a frequently photographed rotunda and colonnade. Enter from Gen Svobody street.
