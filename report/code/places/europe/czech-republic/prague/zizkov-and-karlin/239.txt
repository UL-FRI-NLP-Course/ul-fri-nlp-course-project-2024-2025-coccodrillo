Miminka (David Černý Sculpture) | Prague, Czechia |  Perhaps David Černý's most famous public artwork is the 10 giant crawling babies with slots for faces that appear to be exploring the outside of the TV Tower in Žižkov. Placed there in 2000, they were meant to be a temporary installation, but proved so popular that they were retained.
