Kafka's Grave | Prague, Czechia |  Franz Kafka is buried in the New Jewish Cemetery, which opened around 1890 when the older Jewish cemetery – at the foot of the TV Tower – was closed. To find his grave, follow the main avenue east (signposted), turn right at row 21, then left at the wall; it’s at the end of the ‘block’. Fans make a pilgrimage on 3 June, the anniversary of his death.
