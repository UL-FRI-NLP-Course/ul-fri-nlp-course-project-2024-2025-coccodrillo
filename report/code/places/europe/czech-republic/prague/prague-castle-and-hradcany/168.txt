Strahov Picture Gallery | Prague, Czechia |  In Strahov Monastery’s second courtyard is the Strahov Picture Gallery, with a valuable collection of Gothic, baroque, rococo and romantic art on the 1st floor, and temporary exhibits on the ground floor. Some of the medieval works are extraordinary – don’t miss the very modern-looking 14th-century Jihlava Crucifix. You can also wander around the monastery’s cloister, refectory and chapter house.
