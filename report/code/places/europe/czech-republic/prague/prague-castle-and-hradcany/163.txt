Daliborka | Prague, Czechia |  Accessed from Zlatá ulička, this tower is named after the knight Dalibor of Kozojedy, incarcerated here in 1498 for supporting a peasant rebellion, and later executed. According to legend, he played a violin that could be heard throughout the castle – composer Bedřich Smetana based his 1868 opera Dalibor on the tale. You can peer into the dungeon, and peruse a small display of torture instruments.
