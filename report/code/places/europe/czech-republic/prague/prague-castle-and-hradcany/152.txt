Prague Castle Picture Gallery | Prague, Czechia |  The same Swedish army that looted the famous bronzes in the Wallenstein Garden in 1648 also nicked Rudolf IIâ€™s art treasures. This gallery in the castle's beautiful Renaissance stables houses an exhibition of 16th- to 18th-century European art, based on the Habsburg collection that was begun in 1650 to replace the lost paintings. It includes works by Cranach, Holbein, Rubens, Tintoretto and Titian.
