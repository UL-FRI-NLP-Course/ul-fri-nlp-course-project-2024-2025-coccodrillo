Novomlýnská Water Tower | Prague, Czechia |  A obscure branch of the Prague City Museum, this now defunct, 17th-century water tower houses an interesting exhibit on the various fires that have change the face of the Czech capital, most notably the 1541 inferno that opened up building plots in Malá Strana. There are also views from the top of the tower of the river and the Old Town.
