Dvořák Museum | Prague, Czechia |  The most striking building in the drab neighbourhood south of Ječná is the energetically baroque Vila Amerika, a 1720s, French-style summer house designed by Kilian Dientzenhofer. It’s one of the city’s finest baroque buildings and now houses a museum dedicated to the composer Antonín Dvořák. Special concerts of Dvořák’s music are staged here from May to October.
