NaFilM – National Film Museum | Prague, Czechia |  Not, as many imagine, a museum dedicated to the world of excellent Czech film, but an interactive space that examines how films are made and the history of film-making. Definitely one for the kids on a rainy afternoon – tech-minded little'uns will love building their own hologram, trying their hand at animation, or putting together and old film projector.
