Hotel Jalta Nuclear Bunker | Prague, Czechia |  Hidden beneath the 1950s Hotel Jalta on Wenceslas Square lies a communist-era nuclear shelter that was opened to the public in 2013. The tour, led by a guide in period security-police uniform, takes in a series of secret chambers. The highlight is the communications room, where wiretaps in the bedrooms of important guests were monitored.
