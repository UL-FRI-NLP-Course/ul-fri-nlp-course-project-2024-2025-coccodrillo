Museum of the Senses | Prague, Czechia |  A sure-fire winner with kiddies, this interactive centre bamboozles visitors with its optical illusions. Have your head served on a platter of fruit, enter the infinity disco or the upside-down bathroom, or lie on a bed of nails. Also one of the best places in central Prague for children's birthday parties.
