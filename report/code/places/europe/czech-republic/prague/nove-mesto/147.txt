National Museum New Building | Prague, Czechia |  In 2009 the National Museum expanded into the ugly building next door. This so-called New Building now hosts changing exhibitions on various historical, scientific and technological themes. The structure has had an interesting history itself â€“ dumped on top of the old Prague Stock Exchange by communist-era architect Karel Prager, it served as the Federal Assembly (Czechoslovak parliament) and the headquarters of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
