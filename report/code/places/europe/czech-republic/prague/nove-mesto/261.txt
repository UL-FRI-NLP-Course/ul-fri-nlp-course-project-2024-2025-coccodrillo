Franciscan Garden | Prague, Czechia |  An unexpected, hidden oasis of peace and greenery lies just west of the bustle of Wenceslas Square. There are entrances from the end of the Světovor arcade off Vodičkova, the Alfa arcade off Wenceslas Square, and on Jungmannovo náměstí. It's a lovely place to enjoy a picnic on one of the many benches.
