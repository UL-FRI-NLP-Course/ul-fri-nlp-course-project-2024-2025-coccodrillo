National Museum | Prague, Czechia |  Looming above Wenceslas Square is the neo-Renaissance bulk of the National Museum, designed in the 1880s by Josef Schulz as an architectural symbol of the Czech National Revival. Its magnificent interior is a shrine to the cultural, intellectual and scientific history of Czechia. The museumâ€™s main building reopened in 2018 after several years of renovation work, but the permanent exhibition is yet to be reinstalled.
