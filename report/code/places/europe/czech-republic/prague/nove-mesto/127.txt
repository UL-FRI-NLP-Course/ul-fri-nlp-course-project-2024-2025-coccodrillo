National Theatre | Prague, Czechia |  The recently renovated National Theatre is the neo-Renaissance architectural flagship of the Czech National Revival, and one of Prague’s most impressive buildings. Funded entirely by private donations from across the land and decorated inside and out by a roll call of prominent Czech artists, architect Josef Zítek’s masterpiece burned down within weeks of its 1881 opening but, incredibly, was funded again and restored in less than two years.
