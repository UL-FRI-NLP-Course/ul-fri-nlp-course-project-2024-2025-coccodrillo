Národopisné muzeum | Malá Strana, Prague |  One of Prague's least visited museums is a joy for those into a bit of Slavic colour. Housed in a renovated summer palace, the National Museum’s ethnographic collection does a good job of providing an overview of traditional Czech folk culture and art, including music, costume, farming methods and handicrafts. It's also a venue for folk concerts and workshops demonstrating traditional crafts. The garden cafe is an oasis of peace in summer.
