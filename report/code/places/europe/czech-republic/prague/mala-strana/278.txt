Proudy (David Černý Sculpture) | Malá Strana, Prague |  Sounds of laughter and clicking cameras greet Proudy (2004) by David Černý, a saucy animatronic sculpture of two guys pissing in a puddle shaped like Czechia. The microchip-controlled sculptures appear to be peeing on the country's two main cities, Prague and Brno.
