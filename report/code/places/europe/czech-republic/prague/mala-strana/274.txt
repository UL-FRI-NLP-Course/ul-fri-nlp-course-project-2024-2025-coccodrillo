Smiřický Palace | Malá Strana, Prague |  On 22 May 1618 Czech nobles gathered at the Smiřický Palace to plot a rebellion against their Habsburg rulers. The next day they flung two Habsburg councillors out of a window at Prague Castle – the famous Second Defenestration of Prague that kicked off the Thirty Years' War.
