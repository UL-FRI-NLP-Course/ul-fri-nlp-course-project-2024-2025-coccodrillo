Quo Vadis (David Černý Sculpture) | Malá Strana, Prague |  This bronze Trabant (an East German car) on four human legs is a David Černý tribute to the 4000 East Germans who occupied the garden of the then West German embassy in 1989, before being granted political asylum and leaving their Trabants behind. You can see the sculpture through the fence behind the German embassy. To find it, head uphill along Vlašská, turn left into a children's park, and left again.
