Výstaviště Exhibition Grounds | Prague, Czechia |  This sprawling, somewhat neglected area of attractions and buildings was first laid out for the 1891 Jubilee Exhibition. These days it holds mainly trade fairs (see the website for a calendar), but also has a branch of the National Museum and the city's biggest aquarium.
