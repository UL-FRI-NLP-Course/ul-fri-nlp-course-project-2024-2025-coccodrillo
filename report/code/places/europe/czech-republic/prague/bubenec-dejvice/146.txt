Prague Planetarium | Prague, Czechia |  The planetarium in Stromovka park, just west of Výstaviště, presents various slide and video presentations in addition to daily star shows. Most shows are in Czech only, but one or two of the more popular ones are offered in English, and English-language headphones are available on request. There’s also an astronomical exhibition in the main hall. Opening hours tend to be sporadic throughout the year, so check the website before heading out.
