Gothic Cellar | Prague, Czechia |  The restored Gothic cellars that once lay beneath Charles IV’s palace (now gone) house an exhibition dedicated to the history and legend of Vyšehrad. The admission is frankly a bit steep to see a few panels describing Vyšehrad's transition over the centuries from royal residence to fortress to today's tourist attraction, though the interior architecture is impressive and there are relics on display from early pre-Slavic civilisations.
