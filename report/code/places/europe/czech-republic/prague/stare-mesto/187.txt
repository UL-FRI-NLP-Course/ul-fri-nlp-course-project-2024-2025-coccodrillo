Toy Museum | Staré Město, Prague |  The second-largest toy museum in the world houses an amazing collection put together by film-maker Ivan Steiger. Newly renovated, it's an Aladdin's Cave for adult collectors, but it can be a bit frustrating for the kids as most displays are hands-off. Toys range from Märklin model trains and Steiff teddy bears to Victorian dolls, Action Men and the definitive Barbie collection.
