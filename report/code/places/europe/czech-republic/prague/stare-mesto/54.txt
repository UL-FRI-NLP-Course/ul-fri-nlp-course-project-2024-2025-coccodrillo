Smetana Museum | Staré Město, Prague |  This small museum is devoted to Bedřich Smetana, Bohemia’s favourite composer. It isn’t that interesting, unless you’re a Smetana fan, and has only limited labelling in English, but there’s a good exhibit on popular culture’s feverish response to Smetana’s opera The Bartered Bride – it seems Smetana was the Andrew Lloyd Webber of his day.
