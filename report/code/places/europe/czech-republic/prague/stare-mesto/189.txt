House at the Stone Bell | Staré Město, Prague |  During restoration in the 1980s a baroque stucco facade was stripped away from this elegant medieval building to reveal the original 14th-century Gothic stonework; the eponymous stone bell is on the building’s corner. Inside, two restored Gothic chapels now serve as branches of the Prague City Gallery (with changing exhibits of contemporary art) and as chamber-concert venues.
