Josefov | Staré Město, Prague |  The slice of Staré Město bounded by Kaprova, Dlouhá and Kozí contains the remains of the once-thriving quarter of Josefov, Prague’s former Jewish ghetto, where half-a-dozen old synagogues and the town hall survive along with the powerfully melancholy Old Jewish Cemetery. All are now part of the Prague Jewish Museum.
