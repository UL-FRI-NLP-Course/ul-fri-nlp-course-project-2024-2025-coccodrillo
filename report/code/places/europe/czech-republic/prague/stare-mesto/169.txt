Franz Kafka Monument | Staré Město, Prague |  Commissioned by Prague's Franz Kafka Society in 2003, Jaroslav Róna's unusual sculpture of a mini-Kafka riding on the shoulders of a giant empty suit was based on the writer's story Description of a Struggle, in which the author explores a fantasy landscape from the shoulders of 'an acquaintance' (who may be another aspect of the author's personality). Touch Kafka's well-polished feet for luck.
