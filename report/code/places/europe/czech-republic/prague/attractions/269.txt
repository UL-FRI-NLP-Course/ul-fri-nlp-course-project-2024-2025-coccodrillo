Divoká Šárka | Prague, Czechia |  The valley of the Šárecký potok (Šárka Creek), in the far western end of the city, is one of Prague’s best-known and most popular nature parks. People come here to sunbathe on the rocks, hike along the creek, and even swim in an ice-cold public pool from June through August (10am to 6pm).
