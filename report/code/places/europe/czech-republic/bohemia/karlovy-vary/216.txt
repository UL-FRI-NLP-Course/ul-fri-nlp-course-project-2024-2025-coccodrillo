Park Colonnade | Karlovy Vary, Czechia |  Also known as the Garden Colonnade, this elegant wrought-iron structure dates from 1880 and is the first of the main colonnades that you reach as you enter the spa zone from the north. It was designed by the Viennese architectural firm of Fellner & Helmer, the same company that designed the Market Colonnade.
