Egon Schiele Art Centrum | Český Krumlov, Czechia |  This excellent private gallery houses a small retro­spective of the celebrated and controversial Viennese painter Egon Schiele (1890–1918). Schiele's mother, Marie Soukupová (1862–1935), was born here and Schiele himself lived in Krumlov in 1911. He raised the ire of the townsfolk by hiring young girls as nude models. The centre also houses interesting temporary exhibitions.
