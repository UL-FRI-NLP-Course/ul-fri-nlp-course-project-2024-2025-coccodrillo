Synagogue | Český Krumlov, Czechia |  Český Krumlov's renovated synagogue was built in neo-Romanesque style in 1909. The building survived the Nazi occupation in WWII and was used as a nondenominational place of worship by American soldiers shortly after the war. It's now used for concerts and photo exhibitions and has a cute cafe around the corner. Buy entry tickets at the cafe.
