Queensferry Museum | Scotland, Europe |  On the pretty, terraced High St is the small Queensferry Museum, tracing the town's social history down the centuries. Highlights include a handwritten document from 1638 (the game-changing National Covenant), interesting information on the Forth bridges, and a fascinating exhibit on the Burry Man, part of the villageâ€™s summer-gala festivities.
