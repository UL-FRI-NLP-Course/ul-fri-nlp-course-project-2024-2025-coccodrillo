Loch Lomond & the Trossachs National Park | Loch Lomond, Scotland |  Two areas of great natural beauty, Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, became the heart of Scotland's first national park, created in 2002. The park extends over a huge area, from Balloch north to Tyndrum and Killin, and from Callander west to the forests of Cowal. The length of Loch Lomond means that access between the western part of the park and the Trossachs is either in the far north of the region via Crianlarich or the far south via Drymen.
Waterbuses criss-crossing the lake make it easier for pedestrians and cyclists to connect the two parts of the park.
