Shetland Crofthouse Museum | Shetland, Scotland |  At Boddam a side road leads to the Shetland Crofthouse Museum (donations welcomed). The years drop away when you enter and step back into a primitive existence. Built in 1870, this former dwelling has been restored, thatched and furnished with 19th-century furniture and utensils. The Lerwickâ€“Sumburgh bus stops right outside.
