St John’s Tower | Southern Scotland, Scotland |  This is the only remnant of the church that hosted a parliament in 1315, the year after the celebrated victory at the battle of Bannockburn. John Knox’ son-in-law was the minister here, and Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed overnight in 1563. You can only admire it from the street, but it's very photogenic.
