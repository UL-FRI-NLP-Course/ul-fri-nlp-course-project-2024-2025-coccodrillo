Bonhoga Gallery | Shetland, Scotland |  It’s worth dropping into the Bonhoga Gallery in the restored Weisdale Mill. It has monthly, changing exhibitions, and everything – jewellery, crafts and paintings – is on sale. It’s an excellent place to visit, is very friendly, and you’re likely to meet some resident artists. There’s also a cafe, which is ideal for tucking into local produce, in a sunlit conservatory overlooking the burn (stream).
