Isle of Harris Distillery | Outer Hebrides, Scotland |  This distillery started production in 2015, so its first batch of single malt whisky will be ready in 2019; meanwhile, it's producing Isle of Harris gin, too. The modern building is very stylish – the lobby feels like a luxury hotel – and 75-minute tours depart two or three times daily (weekdays only) in summer; they're popular, so book in advance. There's a cafe here, too.
