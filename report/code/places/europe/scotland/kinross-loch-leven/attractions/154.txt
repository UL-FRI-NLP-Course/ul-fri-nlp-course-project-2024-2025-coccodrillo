Lochleven Castle | Lowland Perthshire & Kinross, Scotland |  Evocative Lochleven Castle served as an island fortress and prison from the late 14th century; its most famous captive was Mary, Queen of Scots, who was incarcerated here in 1567. Her famous charms bewitched Willie Douglas, who managed to get hold of the cell keys to release her, then rowed her across to the shore. The castle is now roofless but basically intact and makes for an atmospheric destination; visitors cross to the island by boat (included in admission fee).
