Iron Age House | Outer Hebrides, Scotland |  In 1996 archaeologists excavated an entire Iron Age village at the head of Bosta beach. Afterwards, the village was reburied for protection, but a reconstruction of an Iron Age house now stands nearby. Gather round the peat fire, above which strips of mutton are being smoked, while the custodian explains the domestic arrangements â€“ fascinating, and well worth the trip. Opening hours are provisional, so call ahead to check.
