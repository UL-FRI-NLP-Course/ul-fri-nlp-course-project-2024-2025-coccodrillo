Pentland Hills | Edinburgh, Scotland |  Rising on the southern edge of Edinburgh, the Pentland Hills stretch 16 miles southwest to near Carnwath in Lanarkshire. The hills rise to 579m at their highest point and offer excellent, not-too-strenuous walking with great views. There are several access points along the A702 road on the southern side of the hills. MacEwan's bus 100/101/102/103 runs four to seven times daily along the A702 from Edinburgh Bus Station to Biggar.
