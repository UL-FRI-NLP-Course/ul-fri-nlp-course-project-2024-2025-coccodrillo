Blackford Hill | Edinburgh, Scotland |  A patch of countryside enclosed by the city’s southern suburbs, craggy Blackford Hill (164m) offers pleasant walking and splendid views. The panorama to the north takes in Edinburgh Castle atop its rock, the bristling spine of the Old Town, the monuments on Calton Hill and the ‘sleeping lion’ of Arthur’s Seat.
