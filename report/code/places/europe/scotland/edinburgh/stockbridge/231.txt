St Bernard's Well | Edinburgh, Scotland |  St Bernard's Well is a circular temple with a statue of Hygeia, the goddess of health, built in 1789. The sulphurous spring within was discovered by schoolboys from George Heriot's School in 1760, and became hugely popular during the late-18th-century fad for 'taking the waters' â€“ one visitor compared the taste to 'the washings of foul gun barrels'.
