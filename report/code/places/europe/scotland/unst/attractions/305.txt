Unst Boat Haven | Shetland, Scotland |  This large shed is a boatieâ€™s delight, packed with a beautifully cared for collection of Shetland rowing and sailing boats, all with a backstory. Old photos and maritime artefacts speak of the glory days of Unst fishing. There's a seasonal tearoom out front.
