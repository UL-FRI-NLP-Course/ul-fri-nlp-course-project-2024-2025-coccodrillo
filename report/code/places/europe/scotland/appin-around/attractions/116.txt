Scottish Sea Life Sanctuary | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  Located 10 miles north of Oban on the shores of Loch Creran, Scottish Sea Life Sanctuary provides a haven for orphaned seal pups. As well as seal pools, there are tanks housing herrings, rays and flatfish, touch pools for children, an otter sanctuary and displays on Scotlandâ€™s marine environment. Seal and otter feeding times are worthwhile. An outdoor nature trail is aimed at young 'uns. You'll save a significant amount if you prebook online. There's a pleasant cafe here by the water.
For extra cost you can prebook and feed the seals yourself.
