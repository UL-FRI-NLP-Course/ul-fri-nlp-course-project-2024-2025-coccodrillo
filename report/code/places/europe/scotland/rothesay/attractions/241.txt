Victorian Toilets | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  Dating from 1899, these toilets are a monument to lavatorial luxury âˆ’ a disinfectant-scented temple of green and black marbled stoneware, glistening white enamel, glass-sided cisterns and gleaming copper pipes. The attendant will escort you into the bathrooms of the opposite sex for a look around when unoccupied. You can shower here, too.
