Corgarff Castle | The Cairngorms, Scotland |  In the wild hills of the eastern Cairngorms, near the A939 road from Cockbridge to Tomintoul, is the impressive fortress of Corgarff Castle. The tower house dates from the 16th century, but the star-shaped defensive curtain wall was added in 1748 when the castle was converted to a military barracks in the wake of the Jacobite rebellion.
