Inverness Castle | Inverness, Scotland |  The hill above the city centre is topped by the picturesque Baronial turrets of Inverness Castle, a pink-sandstone confection dating from 1847 that replaced a medieval castle blown up by the Jacobites in 1746; it serves today as the Sheriff's Court. Itâ€™s not open to the public, but there are good views from the surrounding gardens.
