Deerness | Orkney, Scotland |  A narrow spit joins this peninsula to the eastern edge of Mainland. You reach the end of the road at Mull Head. A short walk from the car park brings you to the Gloup, a spectacular natural arch and narrow channel. Beyond here, a half-mile cliff walk brings you to the Brough of Deerness, an islet/stack that was an important Viking settlement.
