Italian Chapel | Orkney, Scotland |  The Italian Chapel is all that remains of a POW camp that housed the Italian soldiers who worked on the Churchill Barriers. They built the chapel in their spare time, using two Nissen huts, scrap metal and their considerable artistic skills. Itâ€™s quite extraordinary inside and the charming back story makes it an Orkney highlight. One of the artists returned in 1960 to restore the paintwork.
