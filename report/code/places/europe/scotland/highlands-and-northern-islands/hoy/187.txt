Hackness Martello Tower & Battery | Orkney, Scotland |  Built during the Napoleonic Wars, when French ships passed through the Pentland Firth to prey on North Sea merchant vessels, this battery, accompanied by two towers (one across the water), never saw action but is an impressive piece of military architecture. The custodian gives an excellent tour of the barracks and tower – there's a lovely view from the gun platform on top – that really evokes the period.
