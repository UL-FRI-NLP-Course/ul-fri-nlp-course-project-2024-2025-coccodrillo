Dwarfie Stane | Orkney, Scotland |  A short walk from the road through Rackwick Glen, and an obligatory stop on the way to the Old Man of Hoy, the 5000-year-old Dwarfie Stane is the only example of a rock-cut tomb in Scotland. According to Sir Walter Scott, it was the favourite residence of Trolld, a dwarf from Norse legend.
