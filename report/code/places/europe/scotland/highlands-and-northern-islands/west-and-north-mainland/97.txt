Skaill House | Orkney, Scotland |  Next to Skara Brae, and entered on a joint ticket, Skaill House is an imposing step-gabled Orcadian mansion built for the bishop in 1620. It may feel a bit anticlimactic catapulting straight from the neolithic to the 1950s decor, but it's an interesting sight in its own right. You can see a smart hidden compartment in the library as well as the bishop's original 17th-century four-poster bed. There are falconry displays in the grounds (adult/child Â£4/3) that can be visited independently.
Self-catering accommodation is also available here.In the 19th century, the laird of Skaill House was curious when a storm revealed some stones in his dunes and began excavating; this revealed Skara Brae to the world.
