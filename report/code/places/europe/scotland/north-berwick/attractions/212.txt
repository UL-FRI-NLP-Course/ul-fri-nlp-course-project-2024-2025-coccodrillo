Yellowcraig | Scotland, Europe |  A broad sandy cove fringed by dunes, meadows and woodland, Yellowcraig looks out to the island of Fidra and its Victorian lighthouse (the inspiration for RL Stevenson's Treasure Island). Amenities include a play park, a network of trails and a barbecue site (prebook). Follow the short path to Yellow Craig, an ancient volcanic vent, for the best sea views.
