Dunbar Town House Museum and Gallery | Scotland, Europe |  This turreted 16th-century town house is home to a small museum outlining Dunbar's history and points of interest, and a gallery exhibiting the work of local artists. It's best seen with a guide from the local history society, who can flesh out the somewhat limited information and show you a former prison cell and Scotland's oldest council chamber, where witches were once tried.
