John Muir's Birthplace | Scotland, Europe |  This excellent interactive museum pays rousing tribute to Dunbar native John Muir (1838â€“1914), better known as a pioneer conservationist and the father of the US national-park system. Set within the town house that was his boyhood home, it traces his life over three floors, evoking a vivid picture of Victorian Dunbar along the way.
