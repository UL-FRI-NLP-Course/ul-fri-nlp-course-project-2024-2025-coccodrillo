Strathnaver Museum | North & West Coast, Scotland |  Housed in an old church, this museum tells the sad story of the Strathnaver Clearances through posters created by local kids. The museum contains memorabilia of Clan Mackay, various items of crofting equipment and a 'St Kilda mailboat', a small wooden boat-shaped container bearing a letter that was used by St Kildans to send messages to the mainland.
Outside the back door of the church is the Farr Stone, a fine carved Pictish cross-slab.
