Aberdeen Art Gallery | Aberdeen, Scotland |  Behind the grand facade of Aberdeen Art Gallery (closed for a major redevelopment until early 2019) is a cool, marble-lined space exhibiting the work of contemporary Scottish and English painters, such as Gwen Hardie, Stephen Conroy, Trevor Sutton and Tim Ollivier. There are also several landscapes by Joan Eardley, who lived in a cottage on the cliffs near Stonehaven in the 1950s and '60s and painted tempestuous oils of the North Sea and poignant portraits of slum children.
Among the Pre-Raphaelite works upstairs, look out for the paintings by Aberdeen artist William Dyce (1806â€“64), ranging from religious works to rural scenes.
