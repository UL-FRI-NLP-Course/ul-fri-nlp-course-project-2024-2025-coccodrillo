St Nicholas Church | Aberdeen, Scotland |  On the northern side of Union St, 300m west of Castlegate, is St Nicholas Church, the so-called 'Mither Kirk' (Mother Church) of Aberdeen. The granite spire dates from the 19th century, but there has been a church on this site since the 12th century; the early-15th-century St Mary's Chapel survives in the eastern part of the church.
