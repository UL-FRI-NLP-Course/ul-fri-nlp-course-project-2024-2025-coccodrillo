St Blane's Chapel | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  At the southern end of Bute island, the picturesque ruins of this 12th-century chapel can be found a 10-minute uphill walk from the road. A holy place from early Christian days and perhaps before, it was an important church until the Reformation.
