Strathspey Steam Railway | The Cairngorms, Scotland |  The Strathspey railway runs steam trains on a section of restored line between Aviemore and Broomhill, 10 miles to the northeast, via Boat of Garten. There are four or five trains daily from June to August, and a more limited service in April, May, September, October and December, with the option of enjoying afternoon tea, Sunday lunch or a five-course dinner on board.
An extension to Grantown-on-Spey is under construction, but will not be complete for several years.
