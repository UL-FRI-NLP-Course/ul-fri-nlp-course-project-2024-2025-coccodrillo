Holm of Papay | Orkney, Scotland |  This uninhabited island just off the eastern shore of Papa Westray is notable for its three chambered cairns, the largest of which (South Cairn) is most impressive, with a very long entrance passage and numerous burial chambers off a central area. Contact the Papay Ranger for boat trips to the island.
