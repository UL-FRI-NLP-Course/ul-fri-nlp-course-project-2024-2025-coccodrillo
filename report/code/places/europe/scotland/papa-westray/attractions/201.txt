Bothy Museum | Orkney, Scotland |  On a historic farm in the centre of Papa Westray, this tiny museum is packed full of objects from the everyday life of the island's past. Agricultural implements and historical snippets take their place alongside hatboxes and moustache cups, the latter designed so men didn't inadvertently dip their whiskers in their cups of tea. It's located at the start of the path to the Knap of Howar.
