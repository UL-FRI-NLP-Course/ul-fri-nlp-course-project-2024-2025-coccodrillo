Kelvingrove Park | Glasgow, Scotland |  On both banks of the meandering River Kelvin, a tributary of the Clyde, this West End park is popular with dog walkers, foot commuters and canoodling students from the nearby university. It hosted the 1888 and 1901 International Exhibitions; the latter saw the opening of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum, the park's most notable structure.
