University of Glasgow | Glasgow, Scotland |  Though founded in 1451, the city's first university has only been located here in the West End since the 1870s. Its imposing sandstone neo-Gothic main building towers over this portion of town from its hilltop position. Elegant quadrangles and whimsical turrets make it worth a visit quite apart from its marvellous Hunterian Museum, art gallery and Mackintosh House.
