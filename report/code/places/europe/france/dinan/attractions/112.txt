Rue du Jerzual & rue du Petit Fort | Brittany, France |  Lined with half-timbered houses, this astonishing cobbled street has been here since at least the 12th century. It leads downhill at a steep angle all the way to the old bridge and the river, to become rue du Petit Fort as it approaches the water. These are two of the best-preserved streets in Brittany, lined with art galleries, antiques shops and restaurants.
