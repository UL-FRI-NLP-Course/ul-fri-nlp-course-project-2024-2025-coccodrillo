Musée du Ski | Parc Naturel Régional des Volcans d'Auvergne, France |  An essential stop for diehard snow-heads, this pocket-sized museum exhibits a collection of vintage ski gear, ice skates, snow shoes and wintry miscellany across three centuries. The museum attendant (he lives upstairs) provides a detailed commentary on ski-boot innovations and local sporting history, though this will be lost on non-French speakers.
Check at the tourist office about opening times, which vary seasonally.
