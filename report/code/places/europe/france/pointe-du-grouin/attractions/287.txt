Pointe du Grouin | Brittany, France |  A short drive from Cancale brings you to this sublime and stormy headland. Rock cleaves the water and fantastic views range over islands and rocks to the sea beyond, while Mont St-Michel is visible to your east. Wander around the well-worn trails and hike around here to your heart's content. An old German pillbox here has been converted into an ornithological observatory and displays information on local bird life in its entrance.
