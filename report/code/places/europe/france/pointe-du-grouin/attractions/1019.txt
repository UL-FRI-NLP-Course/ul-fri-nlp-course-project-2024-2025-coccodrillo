Île des Landes | Brittany, France |  The wave-pounded lozenge of Île des Landes – 1.1km long, slender and uninhabited – is home to hundreds of gulls and other seabirds. It's directly east as you stand at the Pointe du Grouin but as it's a bird reserve, the islet cannot be visited, despite being temptingly close.
