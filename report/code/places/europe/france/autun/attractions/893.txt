Théâtre Romain | Burgundy, France |  Let your imagination run wild at this ancient theatre, designed to hold 16,000 people; try picturing the place filled with cheering (or jeering), toga-clad spectators. From the top look southwest to see the Pierre de Couhard (Rock of Couhard), the 27m-high remains of a Gallo-Roman pyramid that was probably a tomb.
