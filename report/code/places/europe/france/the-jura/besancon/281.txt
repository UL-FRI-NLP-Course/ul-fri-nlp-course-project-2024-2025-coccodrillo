Musée des Beaux-Arts et d’Archéologie | Besançon, France |  France's oldest public museum, founded in 1694, is famous for its stellar collection of local Gallo-Roman archaeology; its Cabinet des Dessins, with some 6000 drawings from the 15th to 20th centuries, including masterpieces by Dürer, Delacroix and Rodin; and its 14th- to 20th-century paintings, with standouts by Titian, Rubens, Goya and Matisse.
When we passed through, the museum was preparing to reopen in December 2018 after extensive renovations.
