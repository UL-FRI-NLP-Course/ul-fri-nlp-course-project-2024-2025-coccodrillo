Parc Micaud | Besan√ßon, France |  Created in the 19th century, this leafy promenade is the ideal spot to stroll by the Doubs River and it's popular with local cyclists. It's a good place for a picnic with views towards the distant citadel.
In summer, a carousel and playground keep kids entertained.
