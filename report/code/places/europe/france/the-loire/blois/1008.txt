Cathédrale St-Louis | Blois, France |  Although Gothic in style, most of this cathedral (including the nave) was rebuilt after a terrible storm in 1678. The stained glass, bearing enigmatic Latin inscriptions, was created by the Dutch artist Jan Dibberts in 2000. The west façade mixes late-Gothic and neoclassical elements.
