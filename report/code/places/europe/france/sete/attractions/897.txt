Musée International des Arts Modestes | Sète, France |  This offbeat gallery occupying a renovated warehouse is refreshingly free of big names – here the emphasis is on the art of everyday objects, curated by local artists Hervé di Rosa and Bernard Belluc. From religious icons to kitsch china and travel souvenirs, it’s like wandering round a jumble sale curated by an art critic.
