Musée Paul Valéry | Sète, France |  Sète was the birthplace of symbolist poet Paul Valéry (1871–1945), and the town’s main museum houses a disappointingly small collection of his works, along with paintings and drawings by other local artists and diverse temporary exhibitions. Valéry is buried in the Cimetière Marin across the street.
