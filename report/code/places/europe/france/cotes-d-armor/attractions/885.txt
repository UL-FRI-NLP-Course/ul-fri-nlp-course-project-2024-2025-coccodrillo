Côte de Granit Rose | Brittany, France |  Running along the coast from Penvern to Trégastel and Ploumanach lies one of Brittany's natural wonders: a delightful and breezy coastline of pink-, salmon- and russet-coloured granite known as the Côte de Granit Rose. Plan time to walk among the marvellously shaped and hued natural boulders and the sepia and coral-coloured beaches.
