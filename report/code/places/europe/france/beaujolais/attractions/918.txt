Salles-Arbuissonnas-en-Beaujolais Priory | Lyon & the Rh√¥ne Valley, France |  For architecture buffs, this 10th-century priory founded by the monks of Cluny is a must. It's notable for its superb Roman cloister and elaborate porch. Adjacent to the building is a small museum that displays art exhibits and Gallo-Roman artefacts and also explores monastic life in past centuries in Salles-Arbuissonnas.
