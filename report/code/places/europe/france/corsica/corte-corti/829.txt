Place Gaffory | Corte, Corsica |  Below the citadel, place Gaffory is a lively little square that’s dominated by the 15th-century Église de l’Annonciation. The bullet holes that pockmark nearby houses date from Corsica’s war of independence. Napoléon’s parents were living just down from the square when his elder brother Joseph, later King of Spain, was born in 1768.
