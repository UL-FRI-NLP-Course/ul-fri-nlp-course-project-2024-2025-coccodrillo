Musée de la Corse | Corte, Corsica |  Housed in the converted and expanded former barracks of the citadel, this intriguing museum is devoted to Corsican anthropology rather than history. The two main galleries cover everything from pottery and agriculture to religious fraternities and tourism – and don’t miss the listening booths that play different genres of Corsican music – while a third stages temporary exhibitions.
