Vieux Port | Bastia, Corsica |  Bastia’s Vieux Port is ringed by precariously tall, pastel-coloured tenements and buzzy brasseries, and overlooked by the twin-towered Église St-Jean Baptiste. The best views of the harbour are from the citadel or the hillside park of Jardin Romieu, reached via a stately old staircase that twists up from the waterfront.
