Escalier du Roi d’Aragon | Bonifacio, Corsica |  Only accessible from the top, this impressive staircase cuts down Bonifacio's southern cliff-face. Legend says that during the siege of 1420, Aragonese troops carved its 187 steep steps from the bottom up in a single night, only to be rebuffed by Bonifacio’s defenders at the top. In reality the steps gave access to an underground freshwater well.
