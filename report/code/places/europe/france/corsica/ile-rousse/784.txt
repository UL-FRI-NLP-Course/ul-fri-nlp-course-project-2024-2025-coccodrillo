Île de la Pietra | Corsica, France |  Low, rocky Île de la Pietra, the ‘russet island’ that gave Île Rousse its name, is a pleasant 15-minute stroll from the centre, across a short causeway. Apart from the ferry terminal and a solitary hotel, it’s uninhabited. Walk up to the Genoese watchtower above the port, then follow the footpath that winds to the lighthouse at its far end.
