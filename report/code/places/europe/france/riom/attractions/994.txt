Basilique St-Amable | Auvergne, France |  This ornate Romanesque church dates back to the 13th century, though its Gothic flourishes (such as the bell tower) were added in the 19th century. The basilica honours Riom-born Saint Amable, said to have ousted demons from their unlucky human hosts and commanded powers over fire and snakes.
