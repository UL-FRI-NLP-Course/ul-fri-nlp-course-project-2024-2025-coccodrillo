Musée Régional d’Auvergne | Auvergne, France |  This 4000-object collection is a thorough primer on local traditions, with a focus on rural customs in the 19th century (expect plenty of antique farming implements and peasant garb). Guided tours only (in French).
In low season, groups can call to arrange a bespoke guided tour.
