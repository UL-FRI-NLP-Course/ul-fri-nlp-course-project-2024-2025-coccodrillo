Église St-Michel des Lions | Limoges, France |  Named for the two granite lions flanking its door, Église St-Michel des Lions was built between the 14th and 16th centuries. It contains the relics (including the skull) of St Martial, Limoges’ first bishop, who converted the city to Christianity. Look for the huge copper ball perched atop its 65m-high spire.
