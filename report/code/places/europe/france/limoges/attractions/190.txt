Cathédrale St-Étienne | Limoges, France |  Built between 1273 and 1888, Limoges’ Gothic cathedral is worth a visit for the Flamboyant-style Portail St-Jean, as well as a glorious rose window, a Renaissance choir screen (beneath the organ loft), and three ornate tombs in the chancel. The bell tower’s lower three stories are part of the few remaining Romanesque portions of the cathedral; its top four storeys are Gothic.
