Temple de Mercure | Parc Naturel Régional des Volcans d'Auvergne, France |  An enigmatic imprint of the distant past stands atop the summit of Puy de Dôme: a 1st-century Gallo-Roman temple undergoing gradual restoration. Constructed here to allow it to be visible all the way from Augustonemetum (now Clermont-Ferrand), the temple lay in ruins until its rediscovery in the 19th century. There's a visitors centre that explains the region's Roman history.
The visitors centre follows the opening hours of the Panoramique des Dômes.
