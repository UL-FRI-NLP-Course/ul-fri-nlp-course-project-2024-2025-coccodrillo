Château de Roquebrune | Côte d'Azur, France |  The 10th-century château of Roquebrune crowns the 300m-high pudding-shaped lump on which medieval Roquebrune sits. The castle is an atmospheric place with simple but evocative props of life in medieval times, all interpreted by a free audioguide available at the entrance. It's worth a visit just for the spectacular views of the village's rooftops backed by the sparkling Mediterranean.
