Les Loups du Gévaudan | Languedoc-Roussillon, France |  Wolves once prowled freely through the Lozère forests, but today you’ll see them only in this sanctuary in Ste-Lucie, 7km north of Marvejols and 36km northeast of Mende off the D809. The 25-hectare park sustains around 80 Mongolian, Canadian, Siberian, Arctic and Polish wolves living in semi-freedom. You can wander around the park or take a free guided tour. Special nocturnal visits are also available in high summer. Feedings take place at 4pm.
