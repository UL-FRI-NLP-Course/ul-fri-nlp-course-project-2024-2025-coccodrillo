Arc de Triomphe | Montpellier, France |  Built in 1695, Montpellier's 52m-high triumphal arch is dedicated to Louis XIV. The tourist office organises guided tours in summer that take you up 103 steps inside the arch to the top for panoramic views. The best time to photograph it is just before sunset from Place Royale du Peyrou, when the entire arch glows in the golden light.
