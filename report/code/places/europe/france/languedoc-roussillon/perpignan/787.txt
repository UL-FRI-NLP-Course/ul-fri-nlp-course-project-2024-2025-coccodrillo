Le Castillet & Musée Casa Païral | Perpignan, France |  Like many medieval towns, Perpignan was once encircled by defensive walls. Today all that remains is the red-brick town gate of Le Castillet, at the northern end of the old town. Inside the gateway is the Casa Païral museum, displaying Catalan ephemera from traditional bonnets and lace mantillas to an entire 17th-century kitchen.
