Musée Perrier | Nîmes, France |  World-famous fizzy water Perrier has its source in natural springs 13km southwest of Nîmes. You can watch a 3D film that explains Perrier’s history, the production process and the reason behind the bottle’s iconic shape (spoiler: it’s to do with pressure), and pick up Perrier-themed souvenirs in the shop. Guided tours take you to the springs.
The main plant supplies around 900 million bottles every year.
