Musée Jacques Cartier | St-Malo, France |  This 16th-century manor house was the home of controversial explorer Jacques Cartier (1491–1557), who mapped the St Lawrence River and whose explorations laid the basis for France's claim to Canada. The museum illustrates the explorer's life, with visits by one-hour guided tour only (in French, but translation sheets are available).
