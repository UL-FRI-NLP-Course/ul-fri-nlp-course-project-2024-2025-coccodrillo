Mémorial 39–45 | St-Malo, France |  Constructed in the mid-18th century, Fort de la Cité d'Alet was used as a German base during WWII. One of the bunkers now houses this memorial, which depicts St-Malo's violent WWII history and liberation, and includes a 45-minute film in French on the Battle of St-Malo (not shown on every tour). Some guided visits are conducted in English; call ahead to confirm times.
