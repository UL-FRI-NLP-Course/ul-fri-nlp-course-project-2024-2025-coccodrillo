Roman Amphitheatre | The Dordogne, France |  The ruins of the city’s amphitheatre, designed to hold more than 20,000 baying spectators, was one of the largest such structures in Gaul. Today the tops of the arches have been revealed and embrace a peaceful park and fountain, the Jardin des Arènes, popular with local families.
