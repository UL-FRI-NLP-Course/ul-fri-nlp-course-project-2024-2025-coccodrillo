Ôkhra Conservatoire des Ocres et de la Couleur | The Luberon, France |  This art centre is a great place to see ochre in action. Occupying a disused ochre factory on the D104 east of Roussillon, it explores the mineral’s properties through hands-on workshops and guided tours of the factory. The shop upstairs stocks paint pigments and other artists’ supplies.
Bikes can also be rented here.
