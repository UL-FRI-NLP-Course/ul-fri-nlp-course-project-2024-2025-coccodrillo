Palais de la Découverte | Paris, France |  Attached to the Grand Palais, this children’s science museum has excellent temporary exhibits (eg moving lifelike dinosaurs) as well as a hands-on, interactive permanent collection focusing on astronomy, biology, physics and the like. Some of the older exhibits have French-only explanations, but overall this is a dependable family outing. The museum will close for renovations from late 2020 to mid-2024.
