Pont Alexandre III | Paris, France |  Built for the 1900 Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair) to link the Grand Palais and Petit Palais with Les Invalides on the Left Bank, this Beaux Arts–style single-span steel bridge – a listed historical monument – is emblazoned with cherubs and nymphs, with four 17m-high pylons topped with statues of gilded winged horses. From the bridge there are sensational views of the Eiffel Tower. Art nouveau lamps illuminate it at night.
