Musée de l’Homme | Paris, France |  Opened in 1882, this museum traces the evolution of humankind through artefacts gathered from around the world. Fascinating pieces on display include a Cro-Magnon shell necklace, delicately carved mammoth tusks and reindeer jawbones, a variety of Paleolithic stone tools and a Peruvian mummy.
