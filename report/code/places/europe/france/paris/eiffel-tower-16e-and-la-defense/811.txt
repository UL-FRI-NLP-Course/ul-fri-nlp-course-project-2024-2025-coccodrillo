Stade Roland Garros-Musée de la Fédération Française de Tennis | Paris, France |  The Stade Roland Garros, home of the French Open tennis tournament, also shelters the world’s most extravagant tennis museum, which traces the sport’s 500-year history through paintings, sculptures and posters. It will remain closed during the stadium's overhaul, and is not expected to reopen until work is completed (2020).
