Cathédrale de la Sainte-Trinité de Paris | Paris, France |  Shimmering gold onion domes top this striking Russian Orthodox cathedral by the Seine, which was designed by famed French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte and consecrated in late 2016. The cathedral itself opens onto av Rapp, but visitors need to enter via quai Branly to pass through security in the cultural centre then cross the courtyard. Russian recitals and concerts regularly take place here, though the interior is smaller than you'd expect.
