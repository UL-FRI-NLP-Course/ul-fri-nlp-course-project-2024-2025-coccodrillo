La Ménagerie | Latin Quarter, Paris |  Like the Jardin des Plantes in which it’s located, this 170-species zoo is more than a tourist attraction; it also doubles as a research centre for the reproduction of rare and endangered species. During the Prussian siege of 1870, the animals of the day were themselves endangered, when almost all were eaten by starving Parisians.
