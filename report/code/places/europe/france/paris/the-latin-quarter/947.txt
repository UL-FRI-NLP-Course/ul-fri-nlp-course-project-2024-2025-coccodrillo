Les Grandes Serres et Galerie de Botanique | Latin Quarter, Paris |  These four beautiful glass-and-metal greenhouses in the Jardin des Plantes have been in use since 1714. Several of Henri Rousseau's jungle paintings, sometimes on display in the MusÃ©e d'Orsay, were inspired by his frequent visits here.
