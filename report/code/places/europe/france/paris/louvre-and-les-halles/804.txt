Immeuble des Bons Enfants | Paris, France |  Home to the Ministère de la Culture et Communication (Ministry of Culture & Communication), this inspired structure (Francis Soler and Frédéric Druot, 2004) is actually two separate and disparate buildings (originally dating to 1919 and 1960) linked by a metallic web of ‘tracery’ that lets in light and allows the diversity of the existing buildings to be seen.
