Fontaine des Innocents | Paris, France |  The name of this multi-tiered Renaissance fountain (1550) comes off as a bit ironic – nothing in central Paris feels even remotely innocent – but is in fact derived from its location next to the former Cemetery of the Holy Innocents, relocated outside the city walls in 1787.
