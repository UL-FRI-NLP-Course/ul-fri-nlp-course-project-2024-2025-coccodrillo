Jardin Nelson Mandela | Paris, France |  Adjacent to the canopied Forum des Halles underground mall, late-Gothic Église St-Eustache and Collection Pinault – Paris, this 2018-inaugurated park's 4 hectares of meadow-like gardens, fountains and kids' playgrounds provide a refreshing counterpoint to the built-up surrounds. Its 500-plus trees include elms, birches, magnolias and Japanese cherry blossoms.
