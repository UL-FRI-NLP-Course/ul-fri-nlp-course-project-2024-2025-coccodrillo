Brasserie BapBap | Le Marais, Ménilmontant & Belleville, Paris |  BapBap, whose name means 'Brassée à Paris, Bue à Paris' (Brewed in Paris, Beloved in Paris; the latter a twist on 'drunk in Paris', as in 'consumed in Paris'), brews craft beer in an iron-girdered 20th-century warehouse turned garage. Saturday brewery visits (English available; book online) include a peek at the filtering, boiling, whirlpool and fermentation tanks, plus five tastings. Its street-front shop sells its brews and also offers dégustation (tasting).
