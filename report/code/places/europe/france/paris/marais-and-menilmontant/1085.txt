Place du Marché Ste-Catherine | Le Marais, Ménilmontant & Belleville, Paris |  Clad with benches and shaded by trees, this pretty pedestrian square is framed on three sides by atmospheric cafe pavement terraces that are perfect for that all-essential early-evening apéro (predinner drink) beneath the fairy lights at dusk.
