Rébénacq | Parc National des Pyrénées, France |  Rébénacq is one of the few bastides (fortified towns) of the Pyrenees, built in 1347 by a lieutenant of Gaston Fébus, the 11th Count of Foix. Like all bastides, it’s set around a central square, the place de la Bielle, whose buildings and dimensions have barely changed in seven centuries.
