Lugdunum Convenarum Archaeological Site | The Pyrenees, France |  In an open field just outside the village centre, this small archaeological site has a few ruins from the town's glory days as Lugdunum Convenarum, a key Roman settlement (founded around 72 BC). You'll have to use your imagination to picture the theatre, market, temple and other public buildings from the fragments of low-rising stone foundations.
