Futuroscope | Atlantic Coast, France |  This futuristic theme park takes you whizzing through space, diving into the deep-blue ocean depths, and racing around city streets and on a close encounter with creatures of the future, among many other space-age cinematic experiences. To keep things cutting edge, one-third of the attractions change annually. Many are motion-seat set-ups requiring a minimum height of 120cm, but there's a play area for younger children with miniature cars and so on.
Allow at least five hours to see the major attractions; two days to see everything. Futuroscope's numerous hotels are bookable through the website, or directly at the lodging desk. Futuroscope is 10km north of Poitiers in Jaunay-Clan (take exit 28 off the A10). TGV trains link the park's TGV station with cities including Paris and Bordeaux. Local Vitalis buses 1 and E link Futuroscope (Parc de Loisirs stop) with Poitiers' train station (â‚¬1.50, 30 minutes, twice hourly).
