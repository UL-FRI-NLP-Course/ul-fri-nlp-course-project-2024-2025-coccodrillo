Halles du Boulingrin | Reims, France |  The vaulted Halles du Boulingrin were a symbol of Reims’ emergence from the destruction of WWI when they began service as the city’s main food market in 1929. Following a major restoration project, the Halles were reopened in all their art-deco glory in September 2012. Besides sheltering a food market, they provide a unique backdrop for exhibitions and cultural events.
