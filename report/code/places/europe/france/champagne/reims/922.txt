Musée St-Rémi | Reims, France |  Housed in a 17th- and 18th-century abbey, this museum homes in on local Gallo-Roman archaeology, 16th-century Flemish tapestries, medieval sculpture and 16th- to 19th-century military history. The centrepiece is the early-18th-century cloister built to replace the original Romanesque one, which dated to the 12th century.
