Plage de l'Écluse | Brittany, France |  Framed by fashionable hotels, a casino and neo-Gothic villas, Plage de l'Écluse is the perfect place to shade yourself in style by renting one of Dinard's trademark bathing tents. Reproductions of Picasso's paintings are often planted in the sand here in high summer.
