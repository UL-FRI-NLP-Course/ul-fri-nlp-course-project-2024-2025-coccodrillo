Musée de la Boulangerie | The Luberon, France |  A museum all about the history of breadmaking might not sound like a Bonnieux must-see, but it’s actually an intriguing visit. Located in a 17th-century building that was used as a bakery until 1920, it explores the baker’s art both in Bonnieux and further afield, with antique millstones, tools, vintage posters and various other bread-related exhibits.
