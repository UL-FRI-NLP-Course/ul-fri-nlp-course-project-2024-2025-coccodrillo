Les Jardins du Pays d'Auge | Normandy, France |  This gorgeous bucolic 4-hectare delight of a garden is surrounded by typical Norman half-timbered buildings, as well as a museum of old tools. For rest and sustenance, there's a sweet country crêperie where you can try no fewer than 80 crêpes (from €2.80) and galettes (from €2.90).
