Église Jeanne d’Arc | Rouen, France |  Dedicated in 1979, the thrillingly bizarre Église Jeanne d'Arc, with its fish-scale exterior, marks the spot where 19-year-old Joan of Arc was burned at the stake in 1431. The church is a lot prettier on the inside, with one entire staggered wall devoted to stained glass, faced by a well-designed semicircle of knee-height pews.
