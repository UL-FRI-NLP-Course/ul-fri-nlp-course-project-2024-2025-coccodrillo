Monument Juif | Rouen, France |  The only relic of Rouenâ€™s medieval Jewish community, expelled by Philippe le Bel in 1306, is hidden underneath the staircase at the eastern end of the Palais de Justice courtyard. An impressive, stone-built Romanesque structure constructed around 1100, it is the oldest extant Jewish communal structure in Western Europe. The only way to see it is on a guided visit. The tourist office runs two-hour tours at 3pm every Tuesday and at 10.30am on the last Friday of every month.
