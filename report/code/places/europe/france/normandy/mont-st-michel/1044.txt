Barrage du Mont St-Michel | Mont St-Michel, France |  Stop by the dam’s observation platform before you cross the bridge to the islet, from where you can see the workings of the dam over the River Couësnon and look out onto Mont St-Michel beyond; the dam is across the street from the place du Barrage shuttle-bus stop.
