Parc de l’Orangerie | Strasbourg, France |  Across from the Council of Europe's Palais de l’Europe, 2km northeast of Grande Île, this flowery park, designed in the 17th century by Le Nôtre, of Versailles fame, is a family magnet with its playgrounds and swan-dotted lake. In summer you can rent rowboats on Lac de l’Orangerie. Kids can get up close to storks and goats at the park’s mini zoo (free).
