Rue de la Chouette | Dijon, France |  Around the north side of Ã‰glise Notre Dame, this street is named after the small stone owl (chouette) carved into the exterior corner of the chapel diagonally across from No 24. Said to grant happiness and wisdom to those who stroke it, it has been worn smooth by generations of fortune-seekers.
