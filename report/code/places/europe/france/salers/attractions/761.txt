Maison de la Salers | Parc Naturel RÃ©gional des Volcans d'Auvergne, France |  The magnificence of local cattle is the focus of this very French museum, 5km north of Salers. Beef produced in Salers is renowned in France for its rich, gamey flavour. The Maison de la Salers, occupying a 17th-century barn, details the cows' particularities with colourful displays and video presentations... before encouraging visitors to sample charcuterie made from these hallowed beasts.
