Musée du Cristal | Champagne, France |  For insight into how crystal is made, visit the Musée du Cristal, where a 15-minute film highlights the different stages involved in crystal production. A new addition is the Atelier du Verre, with regular 45-minute glass-blowing demonstrations, which show more keenly the processes involved. Hands-on workshops are, depending on numbers, also available on request.
