La Boisserie | Champagne, France |  People flock by the coach-load to visit Charles de Gaulle’s vine-swathed home, La Boisserie, its elegant antique furnishings unchanged since he was laid to rest in the village-centre cimetière (graveyard). Tours (English brochure available; price included in admission) begin at the ticket office, situated across D23 from the house, on the Colombey’s southern edge.
