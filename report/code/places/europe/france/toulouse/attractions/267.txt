Musée Paul Dupuy | Toulouse, France |  Browse a treasure trove of religious art, pharmaceutical items and impressive clocks and watches, lovingly assembled by local collector Paul Dupuy and housed within a 17th-century mansion. Ceramic medicine jars and medical tools will make you grimly ponder the prospect of being lanced or sliced open before modern medicine. Highlights are a wooden bench (c 1500) ornamented with scenes from the life of St Étienne, and a 1320 tapestry illustrating stories from Christ's life in silken thread.
