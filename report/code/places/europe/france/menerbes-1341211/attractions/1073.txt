Musée du Tire-Bouchon | The Luberon, France |  You have to be a real wine buff to appreciate this museum – dedicated to the art of the humble corkscrew. There are more than 1000 of them on display at Domaine de la Citadelle, a winery on the D3 towards Cavaillon, where you can sample Côtes du Luberon.
