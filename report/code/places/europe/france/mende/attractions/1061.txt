Cathédrale Notre Dame | Languedoc-Roussillon, France |  The town's improbably large Cathédrale Notre Dame was built in 1368 as the official seat of Mende’s bishop. The cathedral is home to outstanding 18th-century tapestries and a Vierge Noire (Black Madonna) from the 12th century carved from olive wood.
