Bassin de Neptune | Versailles, France |  The gardens' largest fountains include the 17th-century Bassin de Neptune, a dazzling mirage of 99 gushers 300m north of the palace, whose straight side abuts a small pond graced by a winged dragon (Grille du Dragon). At 5.20pm on the same days as the Grandes Eaux Musicales fountain displays, the Bassin de Neptune flows for 10 minutes.
