Petit Trianon | Versailles, France |  Within the Domaine de Marie-Antoinette, the ochre-coloured Petit Trianon, built in the 1760s, was redecorated in 1867 by Empress Eugénie, the consort of Napoleon III, who added Louis XVI–style furnishings similar to the uninspiring pieces that now fill its 1st-floor rooms.
