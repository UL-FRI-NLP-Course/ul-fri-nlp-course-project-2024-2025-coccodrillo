Confiserie Florian | CÃ´te d'Azur, France |  At this sweet factory jams, candied fruits and crystallised violets, roses and verveine leaves are cooked up in a 19th-century flour mill. Free 20-minute tours show you how clementines and other fruits are candied by being simmered in syrup for three minutes every second day over a 45-day period; visit weekdays to see the kitchens in action. Tours end in the boutique, where you can taste and buy.
