Église St-Étienne de Baïgorry | French Basque Country, France |  The lovely church of St-Étienne was built in the 11th century using the red stone of the nearby Arradoy, and is in the Roman-Byzantine style. It's notable for its three floors of galleries, its painted triumphal arch and the three altars embellished with gilded altarpieces. Keep your eyes open for recycled Roman columns in the nave.
