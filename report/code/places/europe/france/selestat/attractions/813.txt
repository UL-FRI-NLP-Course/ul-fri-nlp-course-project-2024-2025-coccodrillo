Illwald | Alsace, France |  On the southeastern fringes of Sélestat, this nature reserve is a mix of deciduous forest and wetlands. It attracts plenty of wildlife, including kingfishers, beavers and France’s largest population of wild deer (some 400 pairs at last count). Interwoven with footpaths, it’s a quiet place for a stroll. It’s a five-minute drive from town via the D159 and D424.
