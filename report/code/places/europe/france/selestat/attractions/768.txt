Bibliothèque Humaniste | Alsace, France |  Founded in 1452, this library’s stellar collection features a 7th-century book of Merovingian liturgy, a copy of Cosmographiae Introductio (printed in 1507), in which the New World is referred to as ‘America’ for the first time, and the first written mention of the Christmas tree (1521). Following extensive restoration, the library reopened in all its glory in summer 2018.
