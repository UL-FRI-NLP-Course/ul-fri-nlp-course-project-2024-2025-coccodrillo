Musée Archéologique de St-Raphaël | Côte d'Azur, France |  The waters off St-Raphaël are home to the largest number of antique shipwrecks in France, and this museum explores the town's maritime heritage. You’ll therefore be able to see a 1928 scuba system developed in St-Raphaël and the first commercial equipment developed by Jacques-Yves Cousteau in the 1940s, as well as numerous artefacts rescued from local wrecks. Visitors can also access the adjoining medieval church and panoramic tower.
