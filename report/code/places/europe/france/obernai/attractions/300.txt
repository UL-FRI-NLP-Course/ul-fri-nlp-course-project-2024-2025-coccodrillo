Place du Marché | Alsace, France |  Life spirals around this market square, put to use each Thursday morning, where you’ll find the 16th-century hôtel de ville (town-hall building) embellished with Baroque trompe l’œil; the Renaissance Puits à Six Seaux (Six Bucket Well), just across rue du Général Gouraud; and the bell-topped, 16th-century Halle aux Blés (Corn Exchange).
