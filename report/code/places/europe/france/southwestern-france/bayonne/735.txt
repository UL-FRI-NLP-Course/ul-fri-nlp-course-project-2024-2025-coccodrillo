L’Atelier du Chocolat | Bayonne, France |  Visit this chocolate factory to sample and buy its chocolates (which are also available at a shop on rue Pont Neuf in central Bayonne). While here, explore its little chocolate museum and, even better, watch chocolate being made (Monday through Friday to 4pm; last tour 1½ hours before closing). It's like a Gallic version of Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, only with fewer Oompah Loompahs.
