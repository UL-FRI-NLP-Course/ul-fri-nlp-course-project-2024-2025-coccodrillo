Musée Ste-Croix | Poitiers, France |  The 1970s Brutalist architecture of this art museum, built from reinforced concrete, is a shock after the elegance of its ancient episcopal neighbours. Inside, prehistoric, Roman and medieval artefacts mingle with art from the 14th to 20th centuries. Jean-Baptiste Pierre's magnificent Aurore et Tithon (1747) and several signed statues by sculptor Camille Claudel (1864–1943), artist model and companion to Renoir, are highlights. Occasional temporary exhibitions too.
