Grande Plage | Biarritz, France |  Grand by name, grand by nature, Biarritz’ vast main beach has been the place at which to be seen since the days of Napoléon II and Eugénie. It's wall to wall with bodies on summer days, and dramatically deserted in winter. Hire iconic, striped, 1920s-style beach tents and two beach chairs for €14 per half-day.
