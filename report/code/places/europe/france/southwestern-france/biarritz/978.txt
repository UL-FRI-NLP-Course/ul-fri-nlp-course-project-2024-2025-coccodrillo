Plage de la Milady | Biarritz, France |  A flat arc of sand backed by golf courses and a kids' playground, Plage de la Milady is about 2.5km south of Port Vieux. Look out for the grand edifice of the Chateau d'Ilbarritz on the hilltop above the beach â€“ once one of the town's smartest addresses. Bus 10 or 13 heading south will get you here.
