Réserve Africaine de Sigean | Languedoc-Roussillon, France |  Opened in 1974, this 300-hectare wildlife reserve aims to recreate the atmosphere of the African savannah – a climate not all that different from the Languedoc’s dry and dusty plains. Lions, white rhinos, warthogs, giraffes and zebras are just a few of the 160 species on show, with some 3800 animals here in all. Some areas are drive-through, while others you explore on foot. The reserve is off the A9, 17km south of Narbonne.
