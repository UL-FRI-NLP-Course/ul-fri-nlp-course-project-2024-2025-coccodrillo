Château d'Urtubie | St-Jean de Luz, France |  This small château was constructed in the 13th century and has been in the hands of the same family ever since. Rooms are decorated in period style and are stuffed full of antiques and other treasures. You can even stay overnight (rooms from €100). To get there, follow the D810 about 3km southwest of St-Jean de Luz, in the direction of Spain, and you'll find it sitting pretty just off the road.
