L'Écomusée Basque Jean-Vier | St-Jean de Luz, France |  Basque traditions are brought to life at this illuminating multimedia museum, which explores everything from pelota and Basque architecture to the art of making Izarra (Basque for 'star'), a liqueur made from 20 different local plants. It's around 2km north of St-Jean de Luz.
