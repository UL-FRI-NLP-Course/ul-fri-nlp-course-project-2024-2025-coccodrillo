Obelisk | Clermont-Ferrand, France |  This 19th-century obelisk was fashioned from dark volcanic stone from Volvic and festooned with carvings. The monument was raised in honour of Louis Charles Antoine Desaix, a local general highly esteemed by Napoleon Bonaparte, who died in the Battle of Marengo.
