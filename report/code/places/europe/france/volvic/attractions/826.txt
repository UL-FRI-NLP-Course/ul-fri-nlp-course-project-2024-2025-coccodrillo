Maison de la Pierre | Parc Naturel Régional des Volcans d'Auvergne, France |  Gasp at the daredevil quarrying feats of Volvic's past in this kid-friendly museum. There are subterranean passages to explore (bring a jacket) and flash-bang audiovisuals that bring to life the region's volcanic history. There's English subtitling and a visit takes up to 1½ hours.
It's a 500m walk west of Volvic's tourist office, along rue du Calvaire.
