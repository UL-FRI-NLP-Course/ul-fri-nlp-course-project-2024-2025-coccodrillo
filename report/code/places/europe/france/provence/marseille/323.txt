Galerie Trajectoire | Marseille, France |  This teeny tiny art gallery, located along a narrow sloping road in the historic neighbourhood of Le Panier, offers a platform to emerging artists and a few well-known names. With seasonal exhibitions and a delightful little caf√©, Galerie Trajectoire is an excellent artistic introduction to the city.
