Musée d’Arts Africains, Océaniens & Amérindiens | Marseille, France |  These three collections of 'exotic' art have been installed in the handsome Vieille Charité since 1992. Well worth a visit, the museum explores the cultures of the Americas, Africa and the Pacific through tribal masks, pottery and various other artefacts. Inevitably, the shrunken, ritually decorated heads make quite an impression.
