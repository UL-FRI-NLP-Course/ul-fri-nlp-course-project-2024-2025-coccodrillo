Musée d’Archéologie Méditerranéenne | Marseille, France |  Founded in the mid-19th century, and housed in La Vieille Charité since 1989, this small archaeological museum explores Mediterranean and Near-Eastern civilisations from Mesopotamia to Rome. Of particular note is its Egyptian collection, the second largest in France outside the Louvre, which includes a couple of elegant sarchophagi. Look out too for a famous decorated Minoan vase and a Mesopotamian enamel panel.
