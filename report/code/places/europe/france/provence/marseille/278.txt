Cours Julien | Marseille, France |  Marseille's most vibrant bohemian quarter centres on Cours Julien, an elongated concrete square shaded by palm trees. Itâ€™s lined with great bars, cafes and music venues, and its street-art-slathered side-streets are home to a wealth of bookshops, galleries, tattoo parlours and ethnic restaurants. Markets are held in the square on several days of the week: flowers on Wednesday and Saturday, antique books alternate Saturdays, and stamps or antique books on Sunday.
