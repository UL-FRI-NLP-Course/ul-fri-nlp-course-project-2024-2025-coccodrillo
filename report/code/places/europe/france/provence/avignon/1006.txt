Collection Lambert | Avignon, France |  Reopened in summer 2015 after significant renovation and expansion, Avignon's contemporary-arts museum focuses on works from the 1960s to the present. Work spans from minimalist and conceptual to video and photography â€“ in stark contrast to the classic 18th-century mansion housing it.
