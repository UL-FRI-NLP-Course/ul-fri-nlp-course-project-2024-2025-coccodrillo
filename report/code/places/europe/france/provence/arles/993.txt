Thermes de Constantin | Arles, France |  These partly preserved Roman baths were built for Emperor Constantin's private use in the 4th century. While much of the complex has been built over across the centuries, you can still see the hypocausts (under-floor heating), several plunge pools and the overall elegance of the construction.
