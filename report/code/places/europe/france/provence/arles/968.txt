Ã‰glise Notre Dame de la Major | Arles, France |  Complicated restoration projects mean this 12th-century church, dominating Arles from the highest point in the city, can only be admired from outside. Enduring a chequered history, including desacralisation during the Revolution, it's now the unofficial church of the gardians (Camargue cowboys).
