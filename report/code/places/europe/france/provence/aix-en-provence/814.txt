Église St-Jean de Malte | Aix-en-Provence, France |  This 13th-century Gothic church in Aix’s Quartier Mazarin, built as a fortified place of worship by the Knights Hospitaller, was the first of its kind in Provence and was once the burial place of the medieval Counts of Provence. It sports a 67m tower, and its ancient priory has been converted into the wonderful Musée Granet.
