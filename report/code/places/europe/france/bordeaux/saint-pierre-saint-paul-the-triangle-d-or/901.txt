Musée des Arts Décoratifs et du Design | Bordeaux, France |  Faience pottery, porcelain, gold, iron, glasswork and furniture are displayed at the small Decorative Arts and Design Museum, at home in an elegant golden-stone hôtel particulier (private mansion) dating to 1779. Temporary exhibitions cost extra. Its cafe, with alfresco courtyard seating, is a peaceful spot to linger.
