Promenade des Remparts | Bordeaux, France |  An alley of centurion plane trees charts out the course of this elevated garden behind the Capucins food market, built into the remains of the 5km-long city walls that protected the city in the 14th century. The artillery terraces, oratory and other random architectural vestiges littering the walkway were once part of a 17th-century convent.
