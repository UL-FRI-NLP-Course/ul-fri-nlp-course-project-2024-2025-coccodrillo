Musée d’Ethnographie | Bordeaux, France |  A visit to this Museum of Ethnography is as much an excuse to nose around the old medical faculty of Bordeaux's prestigious university, established in 1441, as it is to admire the largely unsung collection of ethnographic treasures collected in Asia by Victor Segalen (1878–1919) – a French doctor from Brest studying naval medicine in Bordeaux – and other early explorers in the 19th and 20th centuries.
