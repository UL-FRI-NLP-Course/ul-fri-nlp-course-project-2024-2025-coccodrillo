Hôtel de Ville | Lille, France |  Built between 1924 and 1932, Lille's city hall is topped by a slender, 104m-high belfry that was designated a Unesco-listed monument in 2004. Climbing 100 steps leads to a lift that whisks you to the top for a stunning panorama over the town. An audio guide costs €2; binoculars are available for €1. Ring the doorbell to gain entry.
