Le Tripostal | Lille, France |  Splashed with street art murals, this cavernous red-brick postal sorting centre was transformed into an arts centre in 2004, when Lille was the European Capital of Culture. Changing art and photography exhibitions (most free) usually feature local artists; there's also a bar, canteen-style restaurant, a kids' play area and a design shop. Look out too for events such as DJ sets, live music gigs and workshops.
