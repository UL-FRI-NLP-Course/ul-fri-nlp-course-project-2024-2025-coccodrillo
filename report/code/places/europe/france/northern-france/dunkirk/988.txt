Phare de Risban | Dunkirk, France |  Rising 63m high, this automated, first order port lighthouse is the highest of its kind in France (its beam can be seen from 60km away). The lighthouse dates from 1843; you can climb 276 steps to its outdoor platform for views over the port, town and, when visibility is good, the English coast.
