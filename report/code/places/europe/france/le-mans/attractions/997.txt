Musée des 24 Heures | The Loire Valley, France |  About 50 Le Mans Prototype (LMP) cars are the star attraction at this automobile museum, whose oldest vehicles include a De Dion-Bouton (1885) and a locally made Bollée (1899). About 320 days a year, on the adjacent track, you can watch practice sessions (except from noon to 2pm) or races.
