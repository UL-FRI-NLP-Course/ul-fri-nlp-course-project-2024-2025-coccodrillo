Cath√©drale St-Julien du Mans | The Loire Valley, France |  Built from the 11th to the 15th century, this vast cathedral juxtaposes a Romanesque nave with later Gothic elements. The stained glass dates as far back as the early 1100s. In the Chapelle des Anges Musiciens, the celebrated ceiling is decorated with late-14th-century paintings of 47 angels playing musical instruments. Signs in English present the stages of the building's construction.
