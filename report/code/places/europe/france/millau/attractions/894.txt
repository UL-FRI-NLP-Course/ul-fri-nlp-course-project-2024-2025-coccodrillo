Beffroi de Millau | Languedoc-Roussillon, France |  The defining landmark of Millau's historical centre is this medieval 12th-century-built square tower topped by an octagonal 17th-century bell tower. It's a 210-step climb to the top for panoramic views of the town, surrounding countryside and, on a clear day, the monumental Viaduc de Millau.
