Église Ste-Marie | Sarlat-la-Canéda, France |  Église Ste-Marie was ingeniously converted by acclaimed architect Jean Nouvel, whose parents still live in Sarlat, into the town’s touristy Marché Couvert. Its panoramic elevator (buy tickets at tourist office) offers 360-degree views across Sarlat’s countryside.
