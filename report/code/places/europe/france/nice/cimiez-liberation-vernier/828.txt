Le Régina | Nice, France |  Originally Queen Victoria’s wintering palace, this monumental edifice was subsequently converted into apartments. In the 1940s Matisse lived here, using one unit as a studio and another as his home, and it was here that the artist passed away in 1954. Visitors can admire the building from the outside while waiting for a bus downhill from the Matisse Museum.
