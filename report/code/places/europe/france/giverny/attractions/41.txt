Maison et Jardins de Claude Monet | Giverny, France |  Monet’s home for the last 43 years of his life is now a delightful house-museum. His pastel-pink house and Water Lily studio stand on the periphery of the Clos Normand, with its symmetrically laid-out gardens bursting with flowers. Monet bought the Jardin d’Eau (Water Garden) in 1895 and set about creating his trademark lily pond, as well as the famous Japanese bridge (since rebuilt).The charmingly preserved house and beautiful bloom-filled gardens (rather than Monet’s works) are the draws here.
Draped with purple wisteria, the Japanese bridge blends into the asymmetrical foreground and background, creating the intimate atmosphere for which the ‘painter of light’ was renowned.Seasons have an enormous effect on Giverny. From early to late spring, daffodils, tulips, rhododendrons, wisteria and irises appear, followed by poppies and lilies. By June, nasturtiums, roses and sweet peas are in flower. Around September, there are dahlias, sunflowers and hollyhocks.Combined tickets with Paris’ Musée Marmottan Monet cost €21.50/14 per adult/child, and combined adult tickets with Paris’ Musée de l’Orangerie cost €18.50.
