NaturOparC | Alsace, France |  Set amid the vines, this delightful centre is home base for 200 free-flying storks; visit in spring and you're guaranteed to see hatchlings. Cormorants, otters and sea lions show off their fishing prowess several times each afternoon. The park's other resident critters include beaver-like coypus and increasingly rare great hamsters of Alsace. Visit the website for up-to-date feeding times.
