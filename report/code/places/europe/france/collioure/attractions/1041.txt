Musée d’Art Moderne | Collioure, France |  Boat sketches by Matisse and Edouard Pignon along with coastal canvases by Henri Martin and Henri Marre are among the highlights of this small but worthwhile museum. It has a good collection of mainly 20th-century canvases and holds regular exhibitions by local artists.
