Moulin de la Cortina | Collioure, France |  The most scenic way to reach this 14th-century windmill is a 950m walk through olive and almond groves from Fort St-Elme along the Cami del Port de Sant Telm (about 20 minutes). Alternatively, it's a steep 150m walk from the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne. Mediterranean views of boats, rocky coast and brilliant blue sea extend from the mill's raised base.
