Moulin Richard de Bas | Auvergne, France |  Paper has been made here since 1326, and this old-school operation still produces around 200 sheets per day using traditional techniques. Hour-long guided tours (French only) will lead you around a restored 15th-century mill and give you a primer on the history of paper production. It's 4km east of Ambert on the D57.
The adjoining park makes a lovely picnic spot.
