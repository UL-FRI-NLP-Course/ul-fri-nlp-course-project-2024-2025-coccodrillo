Musée Savoisien | Chambéry, France |  Due for a grand reopening in 2020, this museum housed in a Franciscan monastery was closed to undergo a massive renovation when we passed through. When it reopens its doors, visitors can expect a showcase of the turbulent history, rich culture and diverse ethnography of Savoie.
