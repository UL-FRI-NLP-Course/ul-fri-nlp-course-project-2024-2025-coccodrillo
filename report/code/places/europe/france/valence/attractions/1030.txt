Cathédrale St-Apollinaire | Lyon & the Rhône Valley, France |  A major landmark in the old town, this impressive cathedral dates from the late 11th century but was largely destroyed in the Wars of Religion before being reconstructed in the 17th century. The square bell tower is a more recent addition – it was built in the 19th century.
