Plage de la Garoupe | Antibes, France |  This stretch of Cap d'Antibes was first raked clear of seaweed in 1922 by Cole Porter and American artist Gerald Murphy to create a sandy beach. Its golden sand is shared today by a small public beach overlooked by the excellent-value terrace of Le Rocher and the private Plage Keller (with white-tablecloth dining, and sun loungers on a jetty).
