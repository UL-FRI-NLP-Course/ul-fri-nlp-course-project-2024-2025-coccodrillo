Salle des Mariages | Menton, France |  In 1957 Jean Cocteau decorated the marriage registry office inside Menton’s town hall from floor to ceiling, covering the walls with swirly drawings, and installing leopard-print carpet, aloe-vera lampshades and red armchairs. In 2018 the hall was reopened to the public after a complete renovation that has left it gleaming. A multilingual audioguide runs you through the symbolism of Cocteau’s designs.
