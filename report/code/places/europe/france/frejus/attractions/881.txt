Théâtre Romain | Côte d'Azur, France |  North of the old town are the ruins of a Roman theatre, where plays, dances and musical performances would have been staged (the gruesome stuff and gladiatorial battles were reserved for the larger amphitheatre, which gives you some idea of popular tastes at the time). Part of the stage and the theatre's outer walls are all that remain.
