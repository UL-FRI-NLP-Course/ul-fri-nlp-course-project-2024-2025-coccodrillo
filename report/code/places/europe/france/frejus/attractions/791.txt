Les Arènes | Côte d'Azur, France |  In comparison to some of Provence's other Roman ruins, Fréjus' amphitheatre is a little underwhelming – it was badly damaged during archaeological digs, and some half-hearted reconstruction hasn't quite recaptured the atmosphere of what was once one of Gaul’s largest amphitheatres (seating 10,000 spectators). Plans have been mooted to rebuild it properly, but so far no joy.
