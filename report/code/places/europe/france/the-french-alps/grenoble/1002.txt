Mus√©e des Troupes de Montagne | Grenoble, France |  Though the subject is niche, this museum exploring France's elite Alpine regiments, which date to 1888, is riveting. An audioguide (in French, English, German or Italian) enlivens displays of military gear, tales of WWII resistance, and brings you right up to present-day mountain troops.
