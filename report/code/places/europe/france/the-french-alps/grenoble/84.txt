Musée de Grenoble | Grenoble, France |  For lovers of European art, this museum is an uplifting place to get lost for a day. There's an even spread of artistic eras on display: an antiquities wing with statuettes from ancient Egypt and Greece, and mostly European art from medieval religious paintings to an impressive assembly of 20th-century luminaries like Bonnard, Ernst, Léger, Magritte, Miró, Modigliani and Soutine.
Among the other highlights: superb 19th-century landscapes of the Dauphiné region; Spanish artist Zurbarán's Annuciation (1638–39); and the gorgeous, light-filled building itself, opened in 1994.Audioguides (€2) are available in French, English and Italian.
