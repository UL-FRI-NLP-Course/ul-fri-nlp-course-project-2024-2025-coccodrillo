Téléphérique Grenoble-Bastille | Grenoble, France |  Hop into a clear-panelled spherical pod for dreamy views of Grenoble's red roofs and magnificent mountains on this cable-car ride up to the Bastille. Les bulles ('the bubbles'), as they're known, have been floating along the 610m cable since 1934, making them the world's first urban cable car system for sightseers.
