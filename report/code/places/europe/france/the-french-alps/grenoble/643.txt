Musée de l’Ancien Évêché | Grenoble, France |  A run-through of regional history, from prehistory through medieval times to the 20th century, is presented within the atmospheric walls of the 13th-century Bishops’ Palace. The building, its walls built atop 3rd-century Roman foundations, is sometimes more interesting than its displays; a highlight is the vaulted chapel. Bonus: there are enjoyable views over the cathedral as you wander around.
Some signage is in English.
