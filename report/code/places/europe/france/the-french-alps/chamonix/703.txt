Grotte de Glace | Chamonix, France |  Step directly inside the glacier at this tunnel of ice, reshaped every year for the past half-century, which sparkles with perennially recreated ice sculptures. To reach it, you'll need to get to Montenvers station (1913m), before jumping onto a cable car and then descending more than 400 steps.
It's closed for three weeks in October.
