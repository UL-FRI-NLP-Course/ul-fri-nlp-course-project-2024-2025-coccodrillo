Ã‰glise Notre Dame de Liesse | Annecy, France |  Largely built during the mid-19th century after its 14th-century predecessor was damaged during the French Revolution, the Church of Our Lady of Liesse rises over Annecy's Vieille Ville (Old Town). The oldest part of the church is the 16th-century square bell tower. Its spare Neoclassical interior is beautifully dappled with light by huge rose windows.
