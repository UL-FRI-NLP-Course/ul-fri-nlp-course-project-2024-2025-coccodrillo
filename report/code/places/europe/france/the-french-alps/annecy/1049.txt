Église St-François de Sales | Annecy, France |  Inspired by the design of Rome's Church of the Gesù, this Catholic church is also known as the Church of the Italians (and hosts mass in Italian). Dating to the early 17th century, its Baroque interior dazzles with teal and white walls and a showy gilt altarpiece.
