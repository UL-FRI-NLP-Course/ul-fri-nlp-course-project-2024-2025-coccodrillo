Couleur Garance | The Luberon, France |  In the days before synthetic dyes, natural colours obtained from plants, fruit and seeds were the main way of creating tints for clothing, textiles and tapestries. This garden contains a collection of such plants (known in French as plantes tinctoriales), and hosts regular workshops demonstrating how they were used. Guided visits (â‚¬8) run on Tuesday and Saturday at 5pm.It's on the southern edge of the village.
