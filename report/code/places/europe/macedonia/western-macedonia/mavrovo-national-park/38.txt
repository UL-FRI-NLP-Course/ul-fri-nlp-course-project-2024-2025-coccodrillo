Gali훾nik | Mavrovo National Park, North Macedonia |  Up a winding, tree-lined road ending in a rocky moonscape 17km southwest of Mavrovo, almost depopulated Gali훾nik features traditional houses along the mountainside. It's also famed for its traditional cheesemaking. The village is placid except during the Gali훾nik Wedding Festival. A wonderful food and accommodation option is available with one of the few local families that live here year-round, and you can hike in the surrounding area, including to Jan훾e.
