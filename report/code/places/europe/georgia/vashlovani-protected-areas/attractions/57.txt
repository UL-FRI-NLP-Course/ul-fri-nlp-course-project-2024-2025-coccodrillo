Khornabuji Fortress | Kakheti, Georgia |  This impressive hilltop ruin is an extraordinary site to behold and it's hard to imagine how it was even constructed atop such a steep peak. The truly intrepid can clamber up to the fortress itself, though you'll need good shoes and no fear of heights to do so. It's a 4km drive from Dedoplis Tskaro, and you'll need a 4WD.
