Batumi Tower | Batumi, Georgia |  Georgia's tallest building (even if much of it is its needle), the 200m-high Batumi Tower boasts a mini Ferris wheel of deeply questionable aesthetic merit implanted in its side. Constructed under the Saakashvili government to be a technological university, it was sold off by his successors to be a Le Meridien hotel.
