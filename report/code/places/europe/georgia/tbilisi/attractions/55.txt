Botanical Gardens | Tbilisi, Georgia |  Itâ€™s easy to wander for a couple of hours in these tree-filled and waterfall-dotted gardens, which stretch more than a kilometre up the valley behind the cliffs of Narikala Fortress. They were opened in 1845 on what had earlier been royal gardens and are today beautifully kept, with a river running through them and some wonderful views.
