Tbilisi History Museum | Tbilisi, Georgia |  The eclectic exhibits here, housed in an old caravanserai, range from models and photos to high-society and folk costumes from the 19th century, and realistic mock-ups of period craft workshops and a small restaurant. It's rather lacking in context or narrative, with no story told, but some of the displays give you a real sense of Tbilisi's past.
