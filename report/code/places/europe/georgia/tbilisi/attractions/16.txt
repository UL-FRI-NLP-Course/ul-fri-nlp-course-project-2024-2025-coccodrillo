Concert Hall & Exhibition Centre | Tbilisi, Georgia |  The two large tubular metallic structures at the north end of Rike Park were commissioned from Italian architect Massimiliano Fuksas during the Saakashvili era as a concert hall and an exhibition centre. After Mikheil Saakashvili lost power, funding dried up and the project remains unfinished today, though the collective behind famous techno club Bassiani managed to hold its first party here in 2013.
