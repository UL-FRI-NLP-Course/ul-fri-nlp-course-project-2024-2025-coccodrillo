Rike Park | Tbilisi, Georgia |  This green expanse along the eastern riverbank, with its winding paths, pools and fountains, is joined to the west side of the Mtkvari by the Bridge of Peace.The two large metallic tubes at the park's north end are a concert hall and exhibition centre, an uncompleted project designed by Italy's Massimiliano Fuksas now literally gathering dust.
