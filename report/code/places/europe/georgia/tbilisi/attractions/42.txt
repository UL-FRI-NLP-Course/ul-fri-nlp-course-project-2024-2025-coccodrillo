Armenian Cathedral of St George | Tbilisi, Georgia |  This large cathedral just above Meidan was founded in 1251, though the current structure dates mainly from the 18th century. Its interior has colourful 18th-century frescoes, and was restored by the Armenian diaspora in 2012–15. King Erekle II’s famed Armenian court poet Sayat Nova was killed here during the Persian invasion of 1795. His tomb is just outside the main door.
