Bridge of Peace | Tbilisi, Georgia |  The Bridge of Peace, a rather incongruously modern glass-and-steel footbridge over the Mtkvari with a totally unnecessary roof, was designed by Italian Michele De Lucchi and opened in 2010. It's definitely one of the most eye-catching of the love-it-or-hate-it avant-garde structures that went up around Georgia during the Saakashvili years.
