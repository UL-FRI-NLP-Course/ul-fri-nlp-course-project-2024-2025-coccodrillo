Mosque | Tbilisi, Georgia |  On the short walk up to the Botanical Gardens you pass the only mosque in Tbilisi that survived Lavrenty Beriaâ€™s purges of the 1930s. It's a red-brick building dating from 1895 and, unusually, Shia and Sunni Muslims pray together here. The interior is prettily frescoed and visitors are welcome to enter after removing their shoes.
