Presidential Palace | Tbilisi, Georgia |  Georgiaâ€™s presidential palace, which is not open to visitors, was a Saakashvili-era prestige project that opened in 2009. Its ultraclassical portico is surmounted by a large, egg-shaped, glass dome, and the overall impression is one of architectural poverty. Georgia's current president, Salome Zurabishvili, lives elsewhere, however, and the palace is used just for ceremonies.
