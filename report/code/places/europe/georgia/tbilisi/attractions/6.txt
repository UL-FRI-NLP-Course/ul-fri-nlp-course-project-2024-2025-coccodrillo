Cable Car | Tbilisi, Georgia |  Tbilisi's most exhilarating ride is its massively popular cable car, which swings from the south end of Rike Park high over the Mtkvari River and the Old Town up to Narikala Fortress. To ride it, you need a Metromoney card, available at the ticket offices if you don't have one. Expect to wait in the summer months, though the line moves fairly quickly.
