Anacopia | Georgia, Europe |  From Novy Afon Caves itâ€™s 2.5km uphill to Anacopia, capital of Abkhazia in the 8th century AD. Taxis can take you halfway up for R100. Inside the hilltop citadel are the ruins of an 8th-century cathedral and a recently rebuilt 11th-century watchtower with awesome views.
