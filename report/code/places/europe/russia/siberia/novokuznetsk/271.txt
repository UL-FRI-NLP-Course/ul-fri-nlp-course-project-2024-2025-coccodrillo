Statue of Vladimir Mayakovsky | Western Siberia, Russia |  Although the doomed writer never actually visited Novokuznetsk, he was so moved by the Soviet project to build a new city that he penned a poem starting with the lines, famous all over Russia, ‘Ya znau budet gorod, ya znau sadu svest’ (‘I know there will be a city, I know the gardens will bloom’). The statue is opposite pr Metallurgov 39.
