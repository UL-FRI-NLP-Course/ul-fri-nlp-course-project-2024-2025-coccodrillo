Assumption Cathedral | Western Siberia, Russia |  The massive Assumption Cathedral was rebuilt after the collapse of the USSR. The Lenin statue that stood nearby was removed in the 2000s â€“ rumour has it a pious official decided the great atheist had no business being anywhere near a house of God.
