Riverside Promenade | Western Siberia, Russia |  Tyumen's sleek riverside promenade runs northwest from the centre almost all the way to Trinity Monastery. The promenade offers great views of the Voznesensko Georgievskiy Church reflected in the Tura River from the opposite (east) bank. Lovers Bridge leads over to the east bank, where you can explore curiously twisted old wooden houses along tree-lined Beregovaya ul (notably No. 73 and 53).
