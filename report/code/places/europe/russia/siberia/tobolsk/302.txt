Castle Prison Museum | Western Siberia, Russia |  At the eerie 1855 Tyuremny Zamok you can get a sense of the grim life behind bars in both Tsarist and Soviet times. The Tsarist exiles were temporarily incarcerated here awaiting a final destination for their banishment. Today various mannequins stoically await their fate.
