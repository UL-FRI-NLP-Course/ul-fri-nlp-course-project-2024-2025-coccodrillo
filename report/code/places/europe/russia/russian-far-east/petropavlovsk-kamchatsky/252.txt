Kamchatka Regional Museum | Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia |  Housed in an attractive half-timbered building overlooking the bay, this museum features an imaginative mix of relics and murals that outline Kamchatkaâ€™s history, including a wide range of prehistoric weapons and tools, taxidermied animals, dioramas of nomadic herders, old cannonballs, weapons and flags. There's no signage in English, however, and so a visit without a guide can be frustrating.
