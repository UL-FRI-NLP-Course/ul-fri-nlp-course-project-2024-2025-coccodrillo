Melnikov Permafrost Institute | Yakutsk, Russia |  True permafrost nerds might check out the Permafrost Institute, about 2km west of the city centre. It has a lab that stays a constant –6°C, but high prices make this more of a tour-group option. Take bus 17 from the centre to get here and get off at the Merzlotka stop (look for the sculpture of a mammoth).
