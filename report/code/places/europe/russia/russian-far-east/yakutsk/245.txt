Archaeology & Ethnography Museum | Yakutsk, Russia |  These two separately run museums are in the same building; sadly, neither enjoys the luxury of signage in English. On the bottom three floors you'll find one of the Far East’s better displays on indigenous peoples, while the 4th floor gives an overview of mammoths in Sakha. See if they’ll let you glimpse into the Mammoth Museum’s refrigerated storage room, which is chock full of mammoth and woolly rhino bones.
