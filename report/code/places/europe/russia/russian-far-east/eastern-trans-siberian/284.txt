Gaivoron Biological Research Centre | Russian Far East, Russia |  The Far East is all about its Amur tigers, and you can see a couple here at the Russian Academy of Sciences biological research reserve, run by Dr Victor Yudin and his daughter. Tours by Vladivostok agents include about 90 minutes of tiger time, lunch and a four-hour ride each way. Itâ€™s not possible to go independently.
