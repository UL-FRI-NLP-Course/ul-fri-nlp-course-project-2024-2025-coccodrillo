Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve | Russian Far East, Russia |  Run by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve is a unique slice of the Primorsky region and a vital remaining habitat for the critically endangered Amur tiger. Accessing the reserve is hard work and doesn't come cheap as the park isn't well set up for tourism. It's best to organise a trip here through a Vladivostok travel agency.
