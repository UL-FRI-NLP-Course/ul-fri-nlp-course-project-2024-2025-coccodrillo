Vladivostok Fortress Museum | Vladivostok, Russia |  On the site of an old artillery battery overlooking Sportivnaya Harbour, this museum has cannons outside, a six-room indoor exhibit of photos and many, many guns inside. There are English explanations, so it's quite accessible by Russian museum standards.
