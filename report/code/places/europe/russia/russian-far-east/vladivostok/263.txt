Transfiguration Cathedral | Vladivostok, Russia |  Vladivostok was building a massive new cathedral on its central square at the time of writing, and it's set to be one of the city's most recognisable sights. Having spent over a decade arguing about which design would be built and where, this massive project is now in motion with the finished cathedral rising to 67m and able to accommodate up to 2000 worshippers.
