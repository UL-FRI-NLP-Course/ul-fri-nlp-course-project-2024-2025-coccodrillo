S-56 Submarine | Vladivostok, Russia |  Perched near the waterfront, the S-56 submarine is worth a look. The first half is a ho-hum exhibit of badges and photos of men with badges (all in Russian). Keep going: towards the back you walk through an officers’ lounge with a framed portrait of Stalin and then onto a bunk room with Christmas-coloured torpedoes. Outside, note the ‘14’, marking the WWII sub’s ‘kills’.
