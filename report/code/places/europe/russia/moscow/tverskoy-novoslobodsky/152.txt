House of Unions | Moscow, Russia |  The green-columned House of Unions dates from the 1780s. Its ballroom, called the Hall of Columns, is famous as the location of one of Stalinâ€™s most grotesque show trials: that of Nikolai Bukharin, a leading Communist Party theorist who had been a close associate of Lenin.
The House of Unions can only be accessed when they stage one of the infrequent concerts.
