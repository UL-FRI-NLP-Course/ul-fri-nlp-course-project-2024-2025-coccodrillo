VDNKh Space Pavilion | Moscow, Russia |  A reopened palatial building sporting an elegant glass cupola, Space Pavilion is packed with rockets, landing capsules and entire space stations, some of which you can walk through. A spheric 5D cinema shows a film that tells the story of the universe from the big bang to the start of space exploration by humans. A life-sized replica of the Voskhod rocket was installed at the main entrance in 1967.
