Ostankino TV Tower | Moscow, Russia |  When the Ostankino TV Tower was built in 1967, it was the tallest free-standing structure in the world (surpassing the Empire State Building). At 540m, it is now fourth on the list.The 337m-high observation deck is open for visitors. A super-speedy lift whisks passengers up in less than 60 seconds. From the top, there are 360-degree views and – horror! – a bit of glass floor.
