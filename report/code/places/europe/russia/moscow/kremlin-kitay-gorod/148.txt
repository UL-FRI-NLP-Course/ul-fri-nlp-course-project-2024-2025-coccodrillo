Old English Court | Moscow, Russia |  This reconstructed 16th-century house, white with wooden roofs, was the residence of Englandâ€™s first emissaries to Russia (sent by Elizabeth I to Ivan the Terrible).
It also served as the base for English merchants, who were allowed to trade duty-free in exchange for providing military supplies to Ivan. Today, it houses a small exhibit dedicated to this early international exchange.
