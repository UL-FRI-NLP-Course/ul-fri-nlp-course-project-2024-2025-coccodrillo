Alexander Garden | Moscow, Russia |  The first public park in Moscow, Alexander Garden sits along the Kremlinâ€™s western wall. Colourful flower beds and impressive Kremlin views make it a favourite strolling spot for Muscovites and tourists alike. Back in the 17th century, the Neglinnaya River ran through the present gardens, with dams and mills along its banks. When the river was diverted underground, the garden was founded by architect Osip Bove, in 1821.
