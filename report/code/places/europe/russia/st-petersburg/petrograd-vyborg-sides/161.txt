Yelagin Palace | St Petersburg, Russia |  The Yelagin Palace was built for his mother by Tsar Alexander I, who had architect Carlo Rossi landscape the entire island while he was at it. The palace, with beautifully restored interiors, is to your right as you cross the footbridge from Kamenny Island. At time of research, the palace was closed for long-term renovations.
