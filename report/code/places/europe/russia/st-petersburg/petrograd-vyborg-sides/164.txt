Commandant’s House | St Petersburg, Russia |  This fascinating museum charts the history of the St Petersburg region from medieval times to 1918. What starts as a fairly standard-issue plod through the city’s history really comes alive once you’re upstairs, with modern, interactive exhibits, even though there’s still a lack of explanations in English.
