Toy Museum | St Petersburg, Russia |  This privately run museum presents its pan-Russian collection in three sections â€“ folk toys, factory toys and artisanal toys. Examples of the last include toys made in Sergiev Posad, home of the ubiquitous matryoshka (nesting doll), a creation often assumed to be far older than it is, being created for the first time only in the 19th century.
At the time of research, the museum was closed for renovations.
