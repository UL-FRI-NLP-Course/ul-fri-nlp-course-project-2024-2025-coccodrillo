State Museum of Urban Sculpture | St Petersburg, Russia |  Despite the name, this two-storey gallery typically has more than just sculpture on display at its changing exhibitions. You may find paintings, video art and mixed media – most of which are created by avant-garde St Petersburg artists. There are a few sculptures in front of the gallery – and occasional installations tucked in the museum courtyard (staff will be sure to take you there if so). Enter from just outside the monastery walls off pl Alexandra Nevskogo.
