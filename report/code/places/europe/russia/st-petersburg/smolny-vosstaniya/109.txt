Lumiere Hall | St Petersburg, Russia |  In a once-industrial part of the city, Lumiere Hall hosts large-format multimedia exhibitions â€“ basically massive 3D projections in a 360-degree space, with audio commentary on the works displayed and the artists behind the creations. Take a seat on beanbags and enjoy the show. Recent installations have included projections of paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky, Van Gogh and Gustav Klimt. It's a 1km walk from the metro station. Head up to the canal and turn right.
On Friday and Saturday, Lumiere Hall also has late-night screenings of popular Hollywood and foreign films. These kick off around 11.30pm.
