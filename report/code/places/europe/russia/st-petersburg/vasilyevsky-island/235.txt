S-189 Submarine Museum | St Petersburg, Russia |  This Whiskey-class Soviet submarine was built in 1954, and – incredibly, once you've looked around inside – served in the Soviet navy until 1990. It has been renovated, repainted and can be visited if a big cruise ship is not docked on the next door Lieutenant Schmidt Passenger Terminal.
Inside, you can see the cramped living quarters and the engine room, look through the still-working periscope and see where the torpedoes were loaded and fired.
