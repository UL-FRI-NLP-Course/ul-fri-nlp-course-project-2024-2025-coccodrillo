Future Site of Kuryokhin Centre | St Petersburg, Russia |  For decades the Kuryokhin Centre, a hub for the contemporary arts, was based in a clapped-out but atmospheric old cinema here. At the time of research a new, excitingly designed home was being constructed with the plan to open later in 2019 when the famous SKIF festival will again be held here.
