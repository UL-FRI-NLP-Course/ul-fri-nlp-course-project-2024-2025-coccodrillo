Dvortsovy Most | St Petersburg, Russia |  This major draw bridge, connecting Palace Sq to Vasilyevsky Island, was completed in 1916. The embankment near here is one of the most popular spots to watch the raising of the bridges (this one goes up and down twice during the night) as there is a live music accompaniment.
