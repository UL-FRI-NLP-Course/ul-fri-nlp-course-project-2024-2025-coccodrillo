Bankovsky Most | St Petersburg, Russia |  This charming footbridge is suspended by cables emerging from the mouths of golden-winged griffins. The name comes from the Assignment Bank (now a further-education institute), which stands on one side of the bridge. It was under reconstruction at the time of writing.
