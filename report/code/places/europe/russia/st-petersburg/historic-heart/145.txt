Mars Field | St Petersburg, Russia |  Named after the Roman god of war and once the scene of 19th-century military parades, the grassy Mars Field is a popular spot for strollers, even though in the early 20th century it was used as a burial ground for victims and heroes of the revolution. At its centre, an eternal flame has been burning since 1957 in memory of the victims of all wars and revolutions in St Petersburg.
