Atlantes | St Petersburg, Russia |  Since 1848, the portico of the New Hermitage has been supported by 10 muscular giants cut from grey granite in the workshop of sculptor Alexander Terebenev. Legend has it that if a bride and groom touch the big toes of each atlas then they will have a long and happy marriage.
