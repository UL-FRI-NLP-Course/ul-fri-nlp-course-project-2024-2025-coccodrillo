St Isidore's Church | St Petersburg, Russia |  The last great church to have been built in St Petersburg before the revolution, this neo-Byzantine beauty dates from 1907 and creates one of the most gorgeous silhouettes in the entire city, best viewed from the nearby Pikalov Bridge, or the Griboyedov Canal. There's little to see inside, but it's worth a detour to see its onion domes.
