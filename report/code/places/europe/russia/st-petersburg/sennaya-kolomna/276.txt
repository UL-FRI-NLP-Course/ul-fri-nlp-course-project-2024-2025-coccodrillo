Berthold Centre | St Petersburg, Russia |  One of St Petersburg's newest 'art clusters', the Berthold Centre has a handful of shops, cafes and galleries spread around a former foundry. There's a courtyard in the centre of the complex that gathers a young, bohemian crowd â€“ especially during special events and concerts (bands sometimes play on a rooftop just overlooking the courtyard).
