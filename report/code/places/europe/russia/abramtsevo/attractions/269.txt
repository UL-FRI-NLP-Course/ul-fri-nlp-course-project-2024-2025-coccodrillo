Manor House | Moscow, Russia |  Several rooms of the manor house have been preserved intact, complete with artwork by various former resident artists. The main attraction is Mamontov’s dining room, featuring Ilya Repin’s portraits of the patron and his wife, as well as Valentin Serov’s luminous Girl with Peaches. A striking maiolica bench by Mikhail Vrubel is in the garden.
