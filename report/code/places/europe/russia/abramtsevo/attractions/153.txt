Saviour Church ‘Not Made by Hand’ | Moscow, Russia |  The prettiest building in the grounds is Saviour Church ‘Not Made by Hand’ (Khram Spasa Nerukotvorny). The structure epitomises Mamontov’s intentions: it’s a carefully researched homage by half a dozen artists to 14th-century Novgorod architecture. The iconostasis is by Ilya Repin and Vasily Polenov. The tiled stove in the corner, still working, is exquisite.
