Punta Lighthouse | Piran, Slovenia |  Punta, the historical ‘point’ of Piran, still has a lighthouse, but today’s is small and relatively modern. Attached to it, however, is the round, serrated tower of the Church of St Clement, which evokes the ancient beacon from which Piran got its name. The church was originally built in the 13th century but altered 500 years later; it has a lovely (though decrepit) stuccoed ceiling.
