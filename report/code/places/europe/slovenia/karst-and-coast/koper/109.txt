Almerigogna Palace | Koper, Slovenia |  At the end of ÄŒevljarska ulica and down the stone steps is the Almerigogna Palace, a painted Venetian Gothic palace (now with a very basic pub on ground level). It's one of Koper's most beautiful buildings, despite the severely faded paintwork. Look high to see the colour remaining under the eaves.
