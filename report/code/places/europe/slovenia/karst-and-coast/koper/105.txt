Čevljarska Ulica | Koper, Slovenia |  Atmospheric Čevljarska ulica, a narrow commercial street for pedestrians, runs south from Titov trg. As you walk under the arch of the Praetorian Palace, look to the right. The little hole in the wall with the Italian inscription ‘Denontie’ was where anonymous denunciations of officials could be made.
