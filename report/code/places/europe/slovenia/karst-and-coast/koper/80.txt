Prešernov Trg | Koper, Slovenia |  The 17th-century Italian family who erected the fountain in Prešernov trg was named Da Ponte; thus it is shaped like a bridge (ponte in Italian). At the square's southern end is the Muda Gate. Erected in 1516, it’s the last of a dozen such entrances to remain standing. On the south side of the archway you’ll see the city symbol: the face of a youth in a sunburst.
