Church of the Holy Rosary | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  At the southern end of Cankarjeva ulica is this impressive church, built in the 16th century. It was a Protestant sanctuary during the Reformation. Beside the church are arcades, a fountain and a monumental staircase designed in the late 1950s by Jože Plečnik to give Kranj a dramatic entrance up from the Sava River.
