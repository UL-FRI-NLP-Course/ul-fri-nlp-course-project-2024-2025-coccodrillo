Spodnji Trg | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  The large square to the east of Mestni trg was where the poorer folk lived in the Middle Ages. The 16th-century Granary at the square's northern end, is where the town's grain stores, collected as taxes, were once kept. Over two floors in the granary house you'll find France Mihelič Gallery, which displays the works of the eponymous artist born in nearby Virmaše in 1907.
