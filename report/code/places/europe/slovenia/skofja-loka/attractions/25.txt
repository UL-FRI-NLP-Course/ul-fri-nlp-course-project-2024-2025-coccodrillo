Capuchin Bridge | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  The tiny Capuchin Bridge (sometimes called the Stone Bridge) leading from the Capuchin monastery is one of the symbols of the town. It originally dates from the 14th century and is an excellent vantage point for the Old Town and the castle as well as the river. To capture the bridge in its full photogenic glory, cross the footbridge over the river just to the east.
