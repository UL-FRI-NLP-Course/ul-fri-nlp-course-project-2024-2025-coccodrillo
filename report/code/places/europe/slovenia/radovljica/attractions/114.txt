Gingerbread Museum | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  In the cellar of Gostilna Lectar is this small, super-sweet showroom, which demonstrates in living colour the particularly Slovenian art of lectarstvo, the making, shaping and decorating of honey dough into hearts, figures and so on. It's cute as a button, with plenty to buy.
