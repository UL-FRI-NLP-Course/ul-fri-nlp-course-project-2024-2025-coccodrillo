Miner’s House | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  Laid out across the slopes encircling the valley are Idrija’s distinctive miners’ houses. Large wooden A-frames with cladding and dozens of windows, they usually had four storeys with living quarters for three or four families. You can visit a traditional miner’s house above the town centre accompanied by a guide from the museum.
