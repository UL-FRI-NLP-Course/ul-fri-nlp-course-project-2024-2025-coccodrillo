Parliament Building | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  The parliament building at the northeast corner of Trg Republike, built between 1954 and 1959 by Vinko Glanz, is no beauty-pageant winner on the outside, but the mammoth portal festooned with bronze sculptures is noteworthy. If you time it right, itâ€™s worth booking a guided tour via the website to see the inside, especially the period-piece mural by Slavko Pengov.
