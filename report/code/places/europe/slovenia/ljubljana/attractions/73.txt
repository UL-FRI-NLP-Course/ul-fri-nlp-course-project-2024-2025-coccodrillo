Cobblers' Bridge | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  In the midst of the Old Town, a small street running west from Stari trg called Pod Trančo (Below Tranča) leads to this evocatively named footbridge. During the Middle Ages this was a place of trade, and a tolled gateway led to the town. Craftspeople worked and lived on bridges (in this case 16 shoemakers) to catch the traffic and avoid paying town taxes – a medieval version of duty-free.
