National Museum of Slovenia – Metelkova | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  This modern building in what is now becoming known as the Museum Quarter contains a bizarre assortment of mostly applied art and objets d’art (furniture, icons, paintings, sporting goods etc) that are tenuously linked through themes (Seating & Lighting). It's a rich collection spread over two very large floors.
