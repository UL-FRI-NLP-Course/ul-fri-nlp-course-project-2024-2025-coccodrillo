Robba Fountain | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  The three titans with their gushing urns on this fountain represent the three rivers of the historic Slovenian province of Carniola: the Sava, Krka and Ljubljanica â€“ but are modern copies. The original fountain, worn down by time and eaten away by urban pollution, is now housed in the National Gallery.
