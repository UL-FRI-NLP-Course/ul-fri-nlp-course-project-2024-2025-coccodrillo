Stari Trg | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  Lined with 19th-century wooden shopfronts, quiet courtyards and cobblestone passageways, this is the heart of the Old Town. From behind the medieval houses on the eastern side, paths once led to Castle Hill, which was a source of water. The buildings fronting the river had large passageways built to allow drainage in case of flooding.
