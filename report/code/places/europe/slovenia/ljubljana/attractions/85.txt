Franciscan Church of the Annunciation | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  The 17th-century salmon-pink Franciscan Church of the Annunciation stands on the northern side of Prešernov trg. The interior has six side altars and an enormous choir stall. The main altar was designed by the Italian sculptor Francesco Robba (1698–1757). To the left of the main altar is a glass-fronted coffin with the spooky remains of St Deodatus.
