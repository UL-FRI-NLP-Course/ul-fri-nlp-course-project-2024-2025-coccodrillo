Parish Church of St Martin | Lake Bled, Slovenia |  This pretty neo-Gothic church was designed by Friedrich von Schmidt in 1905, who also did the city hall and Votive Church in Vienna. Outside there's a small shrine designed by renowned Slovenian architect Jože Plečnik. You can normally only enter the interior during Mass (times posted on the door), but the front door is usually open so that you can peek through the glass.
