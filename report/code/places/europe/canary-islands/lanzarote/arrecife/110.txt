Museo Arqueológico de Lanzarote | Arrecife, Spain |  Tucked into the repurposed mansion of 20th-century lanzaroteño doctor and architect Fermín Rodríguez Bethencourt and his wife Manuela García Parrilla, Lanzarote's 2018-opened archaeology museum romps through the island's long history with excellent multilanguage, multimedia displays ranging from 16th-century ceramic vessels from Seville to an augmented-reality archaeological dig.
At research time, the collection was still expanding, and there's also a changing-exhibitions room.
