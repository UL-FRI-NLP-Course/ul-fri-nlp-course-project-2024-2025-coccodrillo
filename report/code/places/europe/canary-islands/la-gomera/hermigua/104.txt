Parque Etnogr√°fico Los Telares | La Gomera, Spain |  A reconstructed 19th-century gofio (roasted Canarian grain) mill sits at the heart of this multifaceted private ethnographic centre, which also takes in a traditional, self-sufficient organic orchard and a gallery showcasing the local rural lifestyle, typical crafts, Silbo Gomero and the island's history. Visits are with multilingual audioguides. There's also a good gift shop and a cosy cafe.
