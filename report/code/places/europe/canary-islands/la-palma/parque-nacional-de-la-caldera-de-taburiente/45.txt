Pico Bejenado | La Palma, Spain |  At 1854m, clambering up to this peak offers glorious views over the pines, valleys and ridges of the Caldera de Taburiente. The peak marks the conclusion of the hike here from Pista de Valencia below along a clearly marked path through the pines. Note the visitor's book in the metal box chained to one of the rocks â€“ leave your reflections on the views and read about the experiences of other hikers.
