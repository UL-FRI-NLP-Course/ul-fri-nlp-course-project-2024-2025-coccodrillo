Risco Belle Aquatic Gardens | Puerto de la Cruz, Spain |  This is not just any old garden: step through the entrance and you'll be met by a sweeping lawn punctuated with tables and chairs, tropical plants (birds of paradise and poinsettias) and citrus trees. In the historic main house there's a cafe serving drinks and snacks. For a small admission fee you can also visit the magnificent aquatic gardens with herons, dragonflies, a mock lookout tower and benches for quiet contemplation.
With a backdrop of green and birdsong, these gardens feel a world away from the clamour of the coast. Don't miss them.
