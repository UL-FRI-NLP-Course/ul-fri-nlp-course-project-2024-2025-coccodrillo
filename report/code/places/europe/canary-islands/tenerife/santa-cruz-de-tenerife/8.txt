Mercado de Nuestra Señora de África | Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain |  Dating from 1944, this tantalising market is housed in an eye-catching building that combines a Latin American feel with Moorish-style arches and patios. A lofty clock tower helps in locating the place – or just follow the shopping baskets; the mercado offers fresh, competitively priced produce, and is the top choice for locals, including restaurateurs. Stalls are spread over two bustling floors and interspersed with colourful flower sellers, kiosks selling churros and lush subtropical greenery.
It’s not large by Spanish standards (some 140 stalls) but it is still fascinating, with stalls selling mountains of fresh fruit and vegetables and a variety of fish. You can also buy picnic fare such as bread, local cheese, wine and cold cuts.Save money by buying your gourmet deli items here, including jars of chilli-spiked mojo salsa, cactus marmalade, local honey, herbs and spices.
