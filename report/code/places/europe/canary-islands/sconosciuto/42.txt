Museo de la Seda | La Palma, Spain |  Learn the secrets of the caterpillars that spin dresses fit for a marriage. The silk produced here is made according to traditions that have barely changed since the industry arrived on the island in the 16th century. There is an upstairs museum with some magnificent silk garments on display from as far afield as China and India, plus a short film about silk production. End your visit at the downstairs workshop where you can see the weaving in action.
