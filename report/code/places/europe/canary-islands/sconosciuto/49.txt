Fortaleza de Ansite | Gran Canaria, Spain |  These huge rocks form a natural fortress and constitute one of Gran Canaria's most important pre-Hispanic sites. It was here that the Guanches' last stand took place, with many opting to hurl themselves into the ravine rather than face a life of slavery. An interpretive centre fills you in on the history. Break out the hiking boots to explore the 'fortress', with its caves and tunnel cutting through 34m of mountain.
