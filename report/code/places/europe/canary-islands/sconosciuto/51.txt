Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Regla | Fuerteventura, Spain |  The unique 17th-century Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Regla has an Aztec-inspired exterior with its animal motifs. The simple retables behind the altar also have influences that flow to Mexico and are more subdued than the baroque excesses of mainland Spain (stick a coin in the machine on the right at the entrance to light them up). Don’t forget to look up towards the magnificent carved wooden ceiling.
