Roque Bentayga | Gran Canaria, Spain |  A few kilometres west of Tejeda village rises Roque Bentayga (1404m); it's signposted, but you'll need your own transport to get here. Various reminders of the Guanche presence include rock inscriptions, granaries and a sacred ritual site. Don't miss the Centro de Interpretaci√≥n, at the base of the rock, for excellent insights on the area's Guanche history and heritage. Ask there about walking trails to visit the caves that would've once housed the Guanches.
