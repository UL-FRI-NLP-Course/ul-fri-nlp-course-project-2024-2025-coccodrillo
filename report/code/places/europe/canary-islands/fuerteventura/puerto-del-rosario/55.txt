Playa del Pozo | Fuerteventura, Spain |  This sand and seashell beach is a picture, with its gentle curve and protected, calm turquoise waters. There are steps down into the water from the walkway along the northern side of the beach and a lifeguard is usually on duty from May to September. Often there's no one around but it can get busy during peak periods.
