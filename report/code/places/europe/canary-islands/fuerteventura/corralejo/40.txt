Parque Natural de Corralejo | Corralejo, Spain |  This nature park of yellow dunes stretches along the east coast for about 10km south from Corralejo; it's also several kilometres wide, so covers a lot of territory and is excellent for hikes through sand. Breeziness also makes it popular with windsurfers and kiteboarders. The area is also known as Grandes Playas; sunloungers and umbrellas are available for hire in front of the two (eyesore) luxury hotels. The FV-1 runs through the park.
