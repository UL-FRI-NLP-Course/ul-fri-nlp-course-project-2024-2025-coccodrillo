Museo del Vino a Barolo | Langhe, Roero & Monferrato, Italy |  A capricious jaunt through the history of viticulture via light, film and installations, care of the imagination of Swiss designer François Confino (who also designed Turin’s cinema museum). It's set over three floors of the village's stunning medieval castle and is best braved after a tasting session, when it all will seem to make sense.
