Chiesa di San Antonio Abate | Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy |  More beautiful than the cathedral is the deconsecrated church of San Antonio Abate (the patron saint of butchers), which is covered in vibrant frescoes by Pellegrino da San Daniele, aka Martino da Urbino (1467–1547). The cycle is considered the best in Friuli, lending the church the nickname the ‘little Sistine Chapel of Friuli’.
