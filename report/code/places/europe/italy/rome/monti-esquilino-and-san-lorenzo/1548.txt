Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti | Monti, Esquilino & San Lorenzo, Rome |  This little-known museum behind the church of Santa Croce stands on the site of the former home of St Helena. Itâ€™s undeservedly but refreshingly deserted, with a collection of over 3000 exquisite musical instruments that includes gorgeously painted, handle-operated 18th-century Neapolitan street pianos, and one of the oldest known pianos (1722).
