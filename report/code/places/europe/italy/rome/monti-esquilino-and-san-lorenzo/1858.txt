Basilica di Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri | Monti, Esquilino & San Lorenzo, Rome |  This hulking basilica occupies what was once the central hall of Diocletian's baths complex. It was originally designed by Michelangelo, but only the great vaulted ceiling remains from his plans. There's often an organ recital here on Saturdays at 6pm.
