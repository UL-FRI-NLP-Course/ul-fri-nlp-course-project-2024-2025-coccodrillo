Villa Aldobrandini | Monti, Esquilino & San Lorenzo, Rome |  If youâ€™re in need of a breather around Via Nazionale or are in search of somewhere for a picnic, follow Via Mazzarino off the main road and walk up the steps, past 2nd-century ruins, to this graceful, sculpture-dotted garden with gravel paths and benches beneath fragrant orange trees, palms and camellias.
Raised around 10m above street level, these are the grounds of 16th-century Villa Aldobrandini, built to house the extensive art collection of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini. The villa is closed to the public.
