Obelisk | San Giovanni & Testaccio, Rome |  Overlooking Palazzo Laterano, this is said to be the world's largest standing Egyptian obelisk. Topping off at almost 46m, it's also the oldest of Rome's 13 ancient obelisks, dating from the 15th century BC. It originally stood in a temple in Thebes but was shipped to Rome by Constantine II and, after various relocations, placed in its current position in 1588.
