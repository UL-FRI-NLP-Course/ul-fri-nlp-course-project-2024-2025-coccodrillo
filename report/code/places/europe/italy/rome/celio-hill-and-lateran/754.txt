It was rebuilt in the 17th century and given a baroque makeover a century later.Inside, the Cappella Salviati, a 16th-century chapel by Carlo Maderno, contains a fresco of a Madonna with Child that is said to have spoken to St Gregory.
Outside, the Oratorio di Sant’Andrea (open 9.30am to 12.30pm Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday) is the most interesting of three small chapels, with frescoes by Domenichino, Guido Reni and Giovanni Lanfranco.
