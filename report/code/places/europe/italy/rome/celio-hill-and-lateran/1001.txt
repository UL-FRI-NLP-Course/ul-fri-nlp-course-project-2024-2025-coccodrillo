Palazzo Laterano | San Giovanni & Testaccio, Rome |  Palazzo Laterano was the official papal residence until the pope moved to the Vatican in 1377. Adjacent to the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano, it's still technically Vatican property and today houses offices of the Vicariate of Rome. Much altered over the centuries, it owes its current form to a 16th-century facelift by Domenico Fontana.It's not open to the public.
Overlooking the palazzo is Romeâ€™s oldest and tallest obelisk.
