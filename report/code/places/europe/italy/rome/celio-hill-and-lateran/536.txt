Roseto Comunale | San Giovanni & Testaccio, Rome |  Stretched out on the slopes of the Aventine Hill, this idyllic garden boasts more than 1100 of the rarest roses, coaxed into life each spring by a team of horticultural experts. The ancient Circo Massimo plays backdrop, and is just as striking as the grounds themselves.
