Villa Sciarra | Trastevere & Gianicolo, Rome |  In ancient times, this little park on the slopes of the Gianicolo (Gianicolo Hill) was believed to be a sanctuary dedicated to nymphs. It's equally enchanting today: cherubs and sphinxes adorn its fountains, and exotic flora and topiaries shaped to resemble animals grace its grounds.
