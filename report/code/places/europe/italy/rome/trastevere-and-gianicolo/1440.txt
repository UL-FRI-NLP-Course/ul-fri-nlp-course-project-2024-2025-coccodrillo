Torre degli Anguillara | Trastevere & Gianicolo, Rome |  Dating to the Middle Ages, this tower was part of the fortified holdings of the powerful Anguillara clan, which ruled this part of Rome until the 15th century. Today it's one of Trastevere's oldest structures. It now houses a group devoted to studying Dante and as such is called the Casa di Dante. On occasion the group sponsors public readings of the poet's Divine Comedy.
