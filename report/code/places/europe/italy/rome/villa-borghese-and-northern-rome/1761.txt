Villa Ada | Rome, Lazio |  Once the private estate of King Vittorio Emanuele III, Villa Ada is a big rambling park, about 160 hectares, with shady paths, lakes, lawns and woods. It's popular with locals and explodes into life in summer when outdoor concerts are staged during the Roma Incontro il Mondo festival.
