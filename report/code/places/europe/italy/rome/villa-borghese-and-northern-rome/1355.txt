Casino Nobile | Rome, Lazio |  With its oversized neoclassical facade – added by architect Giovan Battista Caretti to embellish an earlier overhaul by Giuseppe Valadier – Casino Nobile makes quite an impression. Inside, in the lavishly decorated interior you can admire the Torlonia family’s fine collection of classically inspired sculpture and early-20th-century paintings from the Scuola Romana (Roman School of Art).
