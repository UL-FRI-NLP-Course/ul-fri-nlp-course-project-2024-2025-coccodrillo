Basilica di San Lorenzo in Damaso | Centro Storico, Rome |  This echoing 4th-century basilica, incorporated into Palazzo della Cancelleria, is one of Rome’s oldest churches. Much altered over the centuries – both Bramante and Gian Lorenzo Bernini worked on it – it owes much of its rich marble and gilt decor to a 19th-century makeover by Giuseppe Valadier.
