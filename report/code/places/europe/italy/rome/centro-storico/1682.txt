Piazza di Pietra | Centro Storico, Rome |  This charming piazza, surrounded by popular bars and cafes, is overlooked by 11 huge Corinthian columns – all that's left of the 2nd-century Tempio di Adriano. The temple formerly housed Rome’s stock exchange and is now used to host conferences and business events.
