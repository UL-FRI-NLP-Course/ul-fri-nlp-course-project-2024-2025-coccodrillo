Piazza di Sant’Ignazio Loyola | Centro Storico, Rome |  Laid out in 1727 to resemble a theatrical set, complete with exits into ‘the wings’, this exquisite rococo piazza is home to the 17th-century Chiesa di Sant’Ignazio di Loyola, an important Jesuit church celebrated for its dizzying trompe l’œil ceiling frescoes.
