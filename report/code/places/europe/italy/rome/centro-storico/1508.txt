Museo Nazionale Romano: Crypta Balbi | Centro Storico, Rome |  The least known of the Museo Nazionale Romano's four museums, the Crypta Balbi sits over the ruins of several medieval buildings, themselves set atop the Teatro di Balbo (13 BC). Archaeological finds illustrate the urban development of the surrounding area, while the museum's underground excavations provide an interesting insight into Rome's multilayered past.
