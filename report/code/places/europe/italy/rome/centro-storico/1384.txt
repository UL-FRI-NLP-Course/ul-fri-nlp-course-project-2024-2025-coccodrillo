Via dei Coronari | Centro Storico, Rome |  This cobbled Renaissance street lined with antique shops, boutiques and costume jewellers is a lovely place for a stroll. It follows the course of the ancient Roman road that connected Piazza Colonna with the Tiber, but owes its name to the medieval coronari (rosary-bead sellers) who used to hang out here, hawking their wares to pilgrims as they passed en route to St Peter's Basilica.
