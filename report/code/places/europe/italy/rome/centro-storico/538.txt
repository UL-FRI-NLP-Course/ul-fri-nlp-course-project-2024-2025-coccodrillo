Dorothy Circus Gallery | Centro Storico, Rome |  A stark contrast to the ancient and stoic city around it, Dorothy Circus Gallery is devoted entirely to pop surrealism, a punchy art movement that draws its inspiration from the likes of tattoos, sci-fi, punk music and Tim Burton flicks. Works by international and Italian names rotate every few months.
