Chiesa di Sant’Andrea al Quirinale | Tridente, Trevi & the Quirinale, Rome |  It’s said that in his old age Bernini liked to come and enjoy the peace of this late-17th-century church, regarded by many as one of his greatest. Faced with severe space limitations, he managed to produce a sense of grandeur by designing an elliptical floor plan with a series of chapels opening onto the central area. Look for the cherubim looking down on worshippers from the lantern and altar.
The opulent interior, decorated with polychrome marble, stucco and gilding, was a favourite of Pope Alexander VII, who used it while in residence at the Palazzo del Quirinale. There's a charge of €2 to visit the sacristy.
