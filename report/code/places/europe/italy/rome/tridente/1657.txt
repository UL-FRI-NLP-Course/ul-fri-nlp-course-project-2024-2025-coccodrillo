Porta del Popolo | Tridente, Trevi & the Quirinale, Rome |  On the northern flank of Piazza del Popolo, the Porta del Popolo was created by Bernini in 1655 to celebrate Queen Christina of Sweden's defection to Catholicism. Its welcoming inscription reads 'Felici Faustoque Ingressui MDCLV' ('For a Happy and Propitious Entrance 1655').
