Museo Nazionale dell’Alta Val d’Agri | Basilicata, Italy |  This modestly interesting museum charts the history of the high valley of Agri, and the nearby Roman town of Grumentum in particular. Artefacts including locally found megafauna bones, Lucanian funerary relics and Roman statuary give dusty testimony to 120,000 years of local history.
