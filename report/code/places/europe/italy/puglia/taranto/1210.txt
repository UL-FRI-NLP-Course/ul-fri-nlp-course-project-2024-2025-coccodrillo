Castello Aragonese | Taranto, Puglia |  Guarding the swing bridge that joins the old and new parts of town, this impressive 15th-century structure, built on Norman and Byzantine predecessors, was once a prison and is currently occupied by the Italian navy, which has restored it. Multilingual and free guided tours, mandatory to get inside, are led by naval officers throughout the day. Opposite are the two remaining columns of the ancient Temple of Poseidon.
