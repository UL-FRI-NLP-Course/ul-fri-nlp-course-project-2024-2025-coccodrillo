Cathedral | Taranto, Puglia |  The 11th-century cathedral is one of Puglia's oldest Romanesque buildings and an extravagant treat. It's dedicated to San Cataldo, an Irish monk who lived and was buried here in the 7th century. Within, the Capella di San Cataldo is a baroque riot of frescoes and polychrome marble inlay.
