Piazza del Duomo | Lecce, Puglia |  Piazza del Duomo is a baroque feast, the city's focal point and a sudden open space amid the surrounding enclosed lanes. During times of invasion the inhabitants of Lecce would barricade themselves in the square, which has conveniently narrow entrances. Lecce's 12th-century cathedral, episcopal palace and museum of sacred art face one another in silent dignity across the square.
