Chiesa di Santa Chiara | Lecce, Puglia |  A notable 15th-century church given a baroque makeover between 1687 and 1691, Santa Chiara is one of the most important and admired churches in Lecce. Inside, every niche and surface swirls with twisting columns and ornate statuary. The ceiling is 18th-century Leccese cartapestra (papier-mâché) masquerading as wood.
