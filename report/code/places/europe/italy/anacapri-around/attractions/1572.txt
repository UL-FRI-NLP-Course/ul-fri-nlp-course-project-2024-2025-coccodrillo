Chiesa di San Michele | Capri, Italy |  Anacapriâ€™s chief building is famous for its handsome floor, a veritable work of art depicting the Adam and Eve story in multicoloured tiles. So masterful is the detail that the floor of the hexagonal church has been left uncovered to allow closer inspection. For the best vista, head up a coiled spiral staircase to a tiny viewing gallery.
