Museo della Ceramica | Vietri sul Mare, Italy |  For a primer on Vietri’s ceramics past, head to this museum in the nearby village of Raito. Housed in a mildewed villa surrounded by a park, the museum has a comprehensive collection, including pieces from the ‘German period’ (1929–47), when the town attracted an influx of artists, mainly from Germany.
