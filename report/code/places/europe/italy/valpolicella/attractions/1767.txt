Pieve di San Giorgio | The Veneto, Italy |  In the tiny hilltop village of San Giorgio, around 6km northwest of San Pietro in Cariano, youâ€™ll find this fresco-filled, cloistered 8th-century Romanesque church. Not old enough for you? In the little garden to its left you can also see a few fragments of an ancient Roman temple.
