Palazzo del Podest√† | Rimini, Italy |  This imposing Gothic palazzo on the northern edge of pretty Piazza Cavour dates to the 14th century. It is not open to the public yet, but a new Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art is in the works, sharing space here with the connected 13th Palazzo dell'Arengo next door.
