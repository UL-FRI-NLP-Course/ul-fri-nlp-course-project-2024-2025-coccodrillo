aRimini Caput Viarum | Rimini, Italy |  Rimini is perhaps a tad over-excited about this newer attraction: a church and hospital dating to 1368 beautifully restored and converted into a small museum, which tells the story of ancient Ariminum through four slickly produced film shorts, an interactive display of the Roman-era town layout and a 2nd-century AD sarcophagus (and a few other structural fragments). It's free, after all, so on a rainy dayâ€¦
It also serves as a tourist information point.
