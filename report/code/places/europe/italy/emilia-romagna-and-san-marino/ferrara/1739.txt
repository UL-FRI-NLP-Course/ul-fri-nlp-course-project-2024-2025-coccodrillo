Museo d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea Filippo de Pisis | Ferrara, Italy |  While normally housing an extensive collection of works by native Ferrara painter and poet Filippo de Pisis (as well as a collection of paintings and sculptures by 20th-century Ferrara artists), the museum will be closed through 2023 for restoration after suffering earthquake damage in 2012.
