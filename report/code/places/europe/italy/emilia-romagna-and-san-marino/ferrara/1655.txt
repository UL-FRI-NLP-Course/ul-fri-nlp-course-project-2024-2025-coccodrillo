City Walls | Ferrara, Italy |  Only Lucca in Tuscany can claim a more complete set of walls than Ferrara, though with a total circumference of 9km, Ferrara's are longer and among the most impressive in Italy. Adorned with a well-marked set of paths, unbroken on the northern and eastern sections, the walls make a pleasant walking or cycling loop.
