Torre Ghirlandina | Modena, Italy |  Rising behind the cathedral is this early-13th-century 87m tower topped with a slender Gothic spire, named after Seville's famous 'Giralda' in the early 16th century by exiled Spanish Jews. You can't go all the way to the top, but you do leg it up 201 stairs at any rate.
Facing it across Piazza Grande is the elegant facade of the Palazzo Comunale.
