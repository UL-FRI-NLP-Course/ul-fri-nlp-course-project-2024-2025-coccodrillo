Battistero degli Ariani | Ravenna, Italy |  The â‚¬1 entry here (unique among Ravenna's Unesco sites) is no reflection of the quality of the artistry inside. The baptistery's breathtaking dome mosaic, depicting the baptism of Christ encircled by the 12 apostles, was completed over a period of years beginning in the 5th century.
