Tomba di Dante | Ravenna, Italy |  A son of Florence, Italy's Sommo Poeta (supreme poet), Dante Alighieri, was expelled from the city of his birth in 1302 for political reasons and spent many years 'on the run'. He finally sought refuge in Ravenna, where he died in 1321.
As a perpetual act of penance, Florence still supplies the oil for the lamp that burns continually in his tomb.
