Parco della Cittadella | Parma, Italy |  Parma's favourite city park is set inside a cinematic 16th-century pentagonal fortress surrounded by an intact 10m-high wall. Restored and made into a park in 2009, it's a great spot for picnics, adventures with kiddos (there is a playground and a giant trampoline) or a workout: a 1.6km jogging trail flanks the ramparts.
