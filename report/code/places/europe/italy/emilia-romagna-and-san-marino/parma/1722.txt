La Casa del Suono | Parma, Italy |  Housed in the 17th-century Chiesa di Santa Elisabetta is this funky modern museum that focuses on the history of music technology. Review the 'ancient' 1970s tape recorders, ponder jazz-age gramophones and stop to listen under a high-tech 'sonic chandelier'. It's a very good time for audiophiles.
