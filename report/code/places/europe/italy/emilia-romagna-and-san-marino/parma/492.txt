Teatro Farnese | Parma, Italy |  Rebuilt to original plans after WWII bombing, this stunning theatre is almost entirely made out of wood. The great Monteverdi, frustrated by the theatre's acoustic problems before its inaugural event in 1628, was forced to put his orchestra in a pit below the stage â€“ long before 19th-century composer Wagner established this modern practice. The stage is accessed via Galleria Nazionale.
