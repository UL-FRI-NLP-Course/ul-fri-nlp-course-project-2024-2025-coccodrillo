Le Due Torri | Bologna, Italy |  Standing sentinel over Piazza di Porta Ravegnana, Bologna's two leaning towers are the city's main symbol. The taller of the two, the 97.2m-high Torre degli Asinelli is open to the public, while the neighbouring 47m Torre Garisenda is sensibly out of bounds given its drunken 3.2m tilt.
