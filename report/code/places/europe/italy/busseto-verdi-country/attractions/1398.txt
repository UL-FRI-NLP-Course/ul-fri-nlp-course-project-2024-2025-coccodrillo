Casa Barezzi | Emilia-Romagna, Italy |  This museum in the centre of Busseto is inside the home of composer Verdi's patron, and was the site of Verdi's first concert. It is lovingly curated and filled with Verdi memorabilia, including papers, furnishings and valuable recordings.
There are seven guided visits per day in Italian; otherwise you're on your own with a brochure (English, French, German and Spanish are available).
