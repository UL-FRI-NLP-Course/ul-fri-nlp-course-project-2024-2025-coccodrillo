Museo Monumento al Deportato Politico e Razziale | Emilia-Romagna, Italy |  The Palazzo dei Pio houses this museum, which documents the experience of prisoners in the nearby Fossoli Concentration Camp (which can only be visited on Sundays and holidays, from February to June and September to November). Ask at the entrance for translated versions (in English and French) of the profoundly moving quotes that cover the museumâ€™s walls, which were extracted from letters written home by prisoners.
