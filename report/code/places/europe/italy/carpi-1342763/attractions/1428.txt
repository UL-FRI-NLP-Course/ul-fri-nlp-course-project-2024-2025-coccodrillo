Cattedrale Dell'Assunta | Emilia-Romagna, Italy |  Begun in 1515 and finished in the 19th century, the cathedral is an architectural cocktail, sporting a baroque facade and a neoclassical interior. The initial plan was based, rather ambitiously, on St Peter's in Rome. The church suffered heavy damage in the 2012 Emilia-Romagna earthquake and was re-opened in the spring of 2017 to much fanfare, including a blessing from Pope Francis.
