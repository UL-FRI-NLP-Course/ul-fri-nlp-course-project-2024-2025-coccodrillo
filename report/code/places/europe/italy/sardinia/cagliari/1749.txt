Chiesa di San Lucifero | Cagliari, Sardinia |  Below this baroque church is a 6th-century crypt where the tomb of the early Archbishop of Cagliari, St Lucifer, rests. In earlier times the area had been part of a Roman burial ground. The church is rarely open, but its austere 17th-century facade is worth a quick look from the outside.
