Chiesa di Santo Sepolcro | Cagliari, Sardinia |  The most astonishing feature of this church is an enormous 17th-century gilded wooden altarpiece housing a figure of the Virgin Mary. From the church, stairs lead down to the crypt, a creepy grotto consisting of two cave-like rooms gouged out of bare rock. In one you'll find a skull and crossbones on the wall.
