Museo d'Arte Siamese | Cagliari, Sardinia |  Cagliari’s medieval heart is an unlikely place for a collection of Asian art, but that’s exactly what you'll find here. Donated to the city by local engineer Stefano Cardu, who had spent many years in Thailand, the collection is highly eclectic. Alongside Ming- and Qing-era Chinese porcelain vases, there are silk paintings, Japanese statuettes, Burmese sculpture and some truly terrifying Thai weapons.
