Basilica di Santa Croce | Cagliari, Sardinia |  Originally a synagogue in the cityâ€™s Ghetto, this basilica was built in the wake of the Jewish expulsion from Sardinia in 1492. It was subsequently enlarged by the Jesuits in the 17th century and its interior chapels are largely baroque in appearance.
