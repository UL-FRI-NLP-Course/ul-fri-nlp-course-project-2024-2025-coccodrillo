Giardino Sotto Le Mure | Cagliari, Sardinia |  A small strip of park in the shadows of the Castello's mighty walls, this 500m-long green space is home to seven works by leading Sardinian sculptor Pinuccio Sciola. You'll also find the lift (closed at time of research) up to the Bastione di Saint Remy.
