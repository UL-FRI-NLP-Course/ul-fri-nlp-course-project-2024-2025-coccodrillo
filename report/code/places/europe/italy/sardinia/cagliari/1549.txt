Palazzo Viceregio | Cagliari, Sardinia |  Just steps from the cathedral, this pale lime palazzo was once home to the city's Spanish and Savoy viceroys. Today it serves as the provincial assembly and stages regular exhibitions and summer music concerts. Inside, you can visit several richly decorated rooms culminating in the Sala del Consiglio, the assembly's main meeting chamber.
