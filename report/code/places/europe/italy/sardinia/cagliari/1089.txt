Palazzo Civico | Cagliari, Sardinia |  Overlooking Piazza Matteotti, the neo-Gothic Palazzo Civico, also known as the Municipio, is home to Cagliariâ€™s municipal council as well as the city's tourist office. Capricious, pompous and at the time of research half-covered by scaffolding, it was built between 1899 and 1913, and faithfully reconstructed after bombing in 1943. The upstairs chambers contain works by a number of Sardinian artists, including Pietro Cavaro. Admission is by appointment only.
