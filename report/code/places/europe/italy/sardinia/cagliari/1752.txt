Chiesa di Sant’Anna | Cagliari, Sardinia |  Largely destroyed by bombing in 1943 but painstakingly rebuilt afterwards, Chiesa di Sant’Anna rises grandly above a wide staircase in the Stampace district. More impressive outside than in, it’s fronted by a towering two-tier baroque facade topped by a pair of matching bell towers.
