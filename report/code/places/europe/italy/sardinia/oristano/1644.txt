Statue of Eleonora | Oristano, Sardinia |  Piazza Eleonora d'Arborea became the city's central square through 19th-century urban reforms. Today it is a quiet spot where you can sit beneath the benign gaze of Queen Eleonora's statue. She holds the ground-breaking Carta di Logu and raises a finger as if she were about to launch into a political speech.
