Chiesa di Stella Maris | Porto Cervo, Sardinia |  Perched above Porto Cervo is Michele Busiri Vici’s surreal white church with a funnel-shaped bell tower. The church hosts classical-music concerts in the summer. Unsurprisingly it’s also done rather well in the donations department, receiving El Greco’s impressive Mater Dolorosa as a Dutch aristocrat’s bequest.
