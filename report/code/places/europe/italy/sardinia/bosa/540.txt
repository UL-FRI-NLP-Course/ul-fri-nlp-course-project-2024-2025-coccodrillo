Ponte Vecchio | Bosa, Sardinia |  Spanning the Temo River near the heart of the old town, Bosa's main bridge is a handsome three-arched affair, built from the region's characteristic red trachyte stone. Cross to the southern side for a perfect photo of Bosa's multicoloured houses stacked up below the Castello Malaspina.
