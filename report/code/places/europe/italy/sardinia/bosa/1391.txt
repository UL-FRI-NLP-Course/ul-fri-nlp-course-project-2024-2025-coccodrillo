Museo Delle Conce | Bosa, Sardinia |  On the south bank of the river, this museum occupies Bosa's former tanneries, which remained in business until after WWII. On the ground floor you can see the original stone tanks where the leather hides were washed; upstairs, explanatory panels and a small collection of photos and old tools illustrate the whole tanning process. English-language handouts offer interesting historical details.
