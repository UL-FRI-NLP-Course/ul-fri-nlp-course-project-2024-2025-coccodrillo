Cattedrale di San Pietro Extramuros | Bosa, Sardinia |  Two kilometres upstream from the Chiesa di Santâ€™ Antonio Abate is this 11th-century cathedral, said to be the oldest Romanesque church in Sardinia. Originally built in 1073, it was subsequently modified with changes made to the apse in the 12th century and a Gothic facade added a century or so later.
