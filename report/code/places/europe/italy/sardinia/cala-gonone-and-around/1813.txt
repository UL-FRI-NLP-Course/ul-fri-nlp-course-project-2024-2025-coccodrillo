Acquario di Cala Gonone | Cala Gonone, Sardinia |  Check out the local marine life before taking the plunge at this shiny new aquarium, designed by architects Peter Chermayeff and Sebastiano Gaias. The 25 tanks bubble with seahorses, jellyfish, rays and – moving into more tropical waters – clownfish and anemones.
