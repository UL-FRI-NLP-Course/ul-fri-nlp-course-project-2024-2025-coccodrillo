Museo della Città | Sassari, Sardinia |  This museum dedicated to Sassari's history is spread over three sites. Its main seat is Palazzo di Città, where exhibits illustrate the city's urban development, festivals and traditions. A short walk away, Palazzo Ducale, which also doubles as Sassari's city hall, has historical artefacts relating to the palace's former life as an aristocratic 18th-century residence and an interesting underground section. The third location is Palazzo della Frumentaria, a 16th-century grain warehouse that's used to stage temporary exhibitions.
