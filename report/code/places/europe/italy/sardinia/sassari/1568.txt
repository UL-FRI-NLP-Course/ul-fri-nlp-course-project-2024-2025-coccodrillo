Piazza Tola | Sassari, Sardinia |  Just north of Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, Piazza Tola was medieval Sassari's main square where condemned heretics were burned at the stake. Overlooking the piazza is the 16th-century Palazzo d'Usini, one of the first Renaissance buildings to be constructed in Sardinia and now home to the city library.
