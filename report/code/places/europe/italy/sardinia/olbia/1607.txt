Chiesa di San Simplicio | Olbia, Sardinia |  Considered to be Galluraâ€™s most important medieval monument, this Romanesque granite church was built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries on what was then the edge of town. It is a curious mix of Tuscan and Lombard styles with little overt decoration other than a couple of 13th-century frescoes depicting medieval bishops.
