Museo Archeologico | Olbia, Sardinia |  Architect Vanni Macciocco designed Olbiaâ€™s strikingly contemporary museum near the port. The museum spells out local history in artefacts, from Roman amulets and pottery to nuraghic finds. The highlight is the relic of a Roman vessel discovered in the old port. A multimedia display recreates the scene of the Vandals burning and sinking such ships in AD 450. Free audioguides are available in English.
