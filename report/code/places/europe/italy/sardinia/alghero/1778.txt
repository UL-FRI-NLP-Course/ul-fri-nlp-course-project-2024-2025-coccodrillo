Torre Porta a Terra | Alghero, Sardinia |  Near the Giardini Pubblici, the 14th-century Torre Porta a Terra is all that remains of Porta a Terra, one of the two main gates into the medieval city. A stumpy 23m-high tower known originally as Porta Reial, it has a panoramic terrace with terrific rooftop views over to the sea.
