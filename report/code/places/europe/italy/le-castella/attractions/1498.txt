Fortezza di Le Castella | Calabria, Italy |  Le Castella is named for its impressive 16th-century Aragonese fortress, a vast edifice linked to the mainland by a short causeway, and that once contained the entire, walled settlement. The philosopher Pliny said that Hannibal constructed the first tower. Evidence shows it was begun in the 4th century BC, designed to protect Crotone in the wars against Pyrrhus.
