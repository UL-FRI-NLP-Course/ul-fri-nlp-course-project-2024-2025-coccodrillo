Column of St Theodore | Venice, Italy |  One of two twin granite columns in the Piazzetta di San Marco, bearing the two patron saints of Venice. This column bears the image of warrior-saint Theodore, who was the patron of the city before St Mark. He holds a spear and stands above a crocodile, which is meant to represent a slain dragon.
