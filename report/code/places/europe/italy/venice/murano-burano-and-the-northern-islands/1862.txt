Chiesa di Santa Caterina | Murano, Burano & the Northern Islands, Venice |  Mazzorbo's late 13th-century Romanesque St Catherine's Church is the only one of the island's 10 medieval churches to survive. Call in to see its wooden carena di nave (ship's hull) ceiling; chances are you'll have the church all to yourself.
