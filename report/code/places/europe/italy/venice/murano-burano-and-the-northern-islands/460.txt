Burano | Murano, Burano & the Northern Islands, Venice |  Burano, with its cheery pastel-coloured houses, is renowned for its handmade lace, which once graced the decolletage and ruffs of European aristocracy. These days, with a couple of notable exceptions, much of the lace sold in local shops is imported. Still, tourists head here in droves to snap photos of the brightly painted houses reflecting in the canals â€“ clogging up the bridges and driving the locals to distraction in the process. It's a much more peaceful place in the evening.
