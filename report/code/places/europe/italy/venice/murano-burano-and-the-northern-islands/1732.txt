Chiesa di Santa Fosca | Murano, Burano & the Northern Islands, Venice |  Literally overshadowed by Torcello's famous basilica, to which it's connected by a colonnaded walkway, this interesting round Byzantine-style church dates from the 11th century. It's relatively unadorned inside, with plain brick walls, a domed wooden roof and Corinthian columns in grey marble.
