Chiesa di San Giacomo di Rialto | San Polo & Santa Croce, Venice |  Steps away from the Rialto Bridge, the most distinctive feature of 12th-century St James' Church is the 15th-century clock set into the facade facing the square. It's now home to a collection of antique musical instruments, and sells tickets to concerts by Interpreti Veneziani.
