Ponte de le Tette | San Polo & Santa Croce, Venice |  ‘Tits Bridge’ got its name in the late 15th century, when neighbourhood prostitutes were encouraged to display their wares in windows instead of taking their marketing campaigns to the streets. On the east side of the nondescript bridge is the Rio Terà de le Carampane (a filled-in canal), named after a noble family’s house (Ca’ Rampani) that became notorious as a meeting place for local streetwalkers, who to this day are known as carampane.
Instead of hanging out in windows, more-ambitious working girls might be found studying: for educated conversation, courtesans might charge 60 times the basic rate of the average carampane.
