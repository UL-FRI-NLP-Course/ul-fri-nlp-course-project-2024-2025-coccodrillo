V-A-C Foundation | Venice, Italy |  Occupying a large palazzo with views over the Giudecca Canal, this beautiful new space for contemporary art was lovingly restored by the Russian V-A-C Foundation. Exhibitions run regularly throughout the year, along with film screenings and performances. Even if there's nothing on, it's a great place to escape to if you need quiet desk space with free wi-fi.
