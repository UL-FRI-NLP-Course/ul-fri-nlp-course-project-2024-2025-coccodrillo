Squero di San Trovaso | Venice, Italy |  This wooden cabin on the Rio di San Trovaso looks like a stray ski chalet, but itâ€™s one of Venice's few working squeri (shipyards), with refinished gondolas drying in the yard. It's best viewed from across the canal, but if the door's open you might be able to peek inside.
