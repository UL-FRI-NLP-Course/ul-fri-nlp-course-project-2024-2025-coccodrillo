Museo Diocesano di Venezia | Venice, Italy |  Housed in a former Benedictine monastery dedicated to Santâ€™Apollonia, this museum has a fairly predictable collection of religious art and the occasional standout temporary show, but the Romanesque cloister is the sole example of its genre in Venice. The adjoining building was a church until 1906, and now contains exhibition spaces.
