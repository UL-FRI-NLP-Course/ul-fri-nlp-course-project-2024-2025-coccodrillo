I Gesuiti | Venice, Italy |  Giddily over the top even by rococo standards, this glitzy 18th-century Jesuit church is difficult to take in all at once, with staggering white-and-green intarsia (inlaid marble) walls that look like a version of Venetian flocked wallpaper, marble curtains draped over the pulpit and a marble carpet spilling down the altar stairs. While the ceiling is a riot of gold-and-white stuccowork, gravity is provided by Titianâ€™s uncharacteristically gloomy Martyrdom of St Lawrence, on the left as you enter the church.
The sacristy is blanketed by 21 impressive works by Jacopo Palma di Giovane.
