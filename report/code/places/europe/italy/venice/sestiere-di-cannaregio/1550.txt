Museo Wagner | Venice, Italy |  Richard Wagner survived the 20-year effort of composing his stormy Ring cycle only to expire in this gracious palazzo, now the casino, in 1883. His suite – filled with musical scores and memorabilia – can be visited by pre-booked one-hour tours (available in Italian, English, German and French).
