Arzanà | Venice, Italy |  Housed in one of Cannaregio's last remaining squeri (boatyards) is a fascinating collection of 50 historic boats and their endlessly varied trimmings, saved from destruction by enthusiastic nonprofit Arzanà. The yard isn't open to the public on a regular basis, but visits can be arranged in advance by email. Donations are used for the maintenance of the boats and museum collection.
