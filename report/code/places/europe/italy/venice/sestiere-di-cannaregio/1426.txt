Chiesa di Sant'Alvise | Venice, Italy |  Don't be fooled by the bare brick exterior of this 1388 church, attached to an Augustinian convent. Inside it's a riot of colour, with extraordinary trompe l'Å“il ceiling frescoes and massive canvases all around. Look out for Tiepolo's La salita al Calvario (The Road to Calvary), a distressingly human depiction of one of Christ's falls under the weight of the cross.
