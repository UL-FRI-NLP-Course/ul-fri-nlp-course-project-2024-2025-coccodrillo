Schola Tedesca | Venice, Italy |  The Schola Tedesca has been the spiritual home of Venice’s Ashkenazi community since 1528. By 16th-century Venetian law, only the German Jewish community could trade in money-lending, and their success shows in the handsome decor. The baroque pulpit and carved benches downstairs are topped by a gilded, elliptical women’s gallery, modelled after a Venetian opera balcony. Entry is by guided tour via Museo Ebraico.
