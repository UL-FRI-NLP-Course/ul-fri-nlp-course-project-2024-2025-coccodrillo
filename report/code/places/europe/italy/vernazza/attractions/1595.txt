Vernazza Harbour | Vernazza, Italy |  Cinque Terre’s only natural harbour has breathtaking views out over the water, and provides the best open-air amusement in Vernazza. Here you can bask on a tiny beach, head off on a boat trip, or just linger over the day’s fresh catch and a glass of Italian’s finest at one of the al fresco restaurants facing the water’s edge.
