Torre dei Marsili | Oltrarno, Florence |  Looming large above Ponte Vecchio is this rectangular, five-storey stone tower, built by the Marsili family as a status symbol in the 12th century. The Della Robbia terracotta on the facade was made for the tower's 19th-century owner, goldsmith Giuseppe Sorbi, who had his workshop inside.
