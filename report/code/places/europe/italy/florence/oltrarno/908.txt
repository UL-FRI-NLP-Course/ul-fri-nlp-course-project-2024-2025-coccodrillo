Fondazione Salvatore Romano | Oltrarno, Florence |  For a change of pace from the Renaissance, head to this Gothic-style former refectory safeguarding an imposing wall fresco by Andrea Orcagna depicting the Last Supper and the Crucifixion (c 1370), one of the largest 14th-century paintings to survive. The museum itself displays a collection of rare 11th-century Romanesque sculpture, paintings and antique furniture donated to the city by art collector and antiquarian Salvatore Romano (1875â€“1955). Tickets are sold at Cappella Brancacci; one ticket covers admission to both sights.
