Ponte degli Alpini | The Veneto, Italy |  Spanning the river is Palladio's photogenic 1569 wooden bridge. Fragile as it seems, it is cleverly engineered to withstand the rush of spring meltwaters from Monte Grappa. Itâ€™s always been critical in times of war: Napoleon bivouacked here and during WWII the bridge was destroyed by the Germans, only to be reconstructed by the Italian Alpine brigade, who adopted it as their emblem.
