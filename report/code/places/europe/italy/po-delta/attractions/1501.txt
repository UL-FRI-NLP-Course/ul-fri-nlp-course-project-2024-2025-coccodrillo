Manifattura dei Marinati | Emilia-Romagna, Italy |  The Manifattura dei Marinati chronicles the town’s traditional eel-fishing industry but is perhaps most fascinating as the place where skewered eels and anchovies lie marinating in traditional vats of Modenese vinegar and salt from Cervia between September and December. You can pop in for a look, of course. The bookshop also rents bikes (per hour/day €3/8).
