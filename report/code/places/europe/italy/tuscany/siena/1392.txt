Orto de' Pecci | Siena, Tuscany |  Operated by a social cooperative that gives support and employment to people with disabilities or dependency problems, this urban oasis is home to a small vineyard with clones of medieval vines, a cooperative organic farm that supplies the on-site restaurant with fruit and vegetables, plenty of animals (geese, goats, ducks and donkeys) and a scattering of site-specific contemporary artworks.
