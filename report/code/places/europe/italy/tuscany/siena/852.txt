Orto Botanico dell'Universit√† | Siena, Tuscany |  The tranquil terraces of this botanical garden (1856), which is spread over 2.5 hectares of the verdant Sant'Agostino Valley, provide gorgeous views across the valley and a welcome escape from the tourist crowds. Owned by the University of Siena, which operates it as a centre for research and education, it features three greenhouses filled with tropical and subtropical species, a citrus house and gardens planted with ornamental, medicinal and food plants. Native and endangered species are also represented.
