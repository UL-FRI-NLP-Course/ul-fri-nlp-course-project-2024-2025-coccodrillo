Museo Diocesano di Arte Sacra | Arezzo, Tuscany |  Located inside a stunning 13th-century palazzo where the bishop of Arezzo lived from 1256, this museum exhibits 12th- to 16th-century works of sacred art originally displayed in churches now destroyed or shut. At the top of the grandiose staircase, on the 1st floor, a series of beautifully frescoed rooms showcase the art collections of various resident bishops over the centuries.
