Palazzo Buontalenti | Pistoia, Tuscany |  Sister gallery to Palazzo de' Rossi on the same street, this palazzo is a fine example of 15th-century Tuscan architecture thanks to leading Florentine architect, Bernardo Buontalenti (1531â€“1608), who worked on the handsome townhouse. (He likewise lent his name to the Grotte de Buontalenti in Florence's Giardino di Boboli.) Seasonal modern-art exhibitions are held here.
Combination tickets with other art museums are available.
