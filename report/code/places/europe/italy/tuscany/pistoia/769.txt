Museo dello Spedale del Ceppo | Pistoia, Tuscany |  The beautifully restored facade of this former hospital, operational from 1277 until 2013, stuns with its 16th-century polychrome terracotta frieze by Giovanni della Robbia. It depicts the Sette Opere di Misericordia (Seven Works of Mercy), and the five medallions represent the Virt√π Teologali (Theological Virtues). Inside, a small museum explores both the fine art of glazed terracotta in the early Renaissance and the history of public healthcare in the 13th-century hospital. 'Gruesome' best describes some of the historic surgical tools exhibited.
Combination tickets with other city-run museums are available.
