Chiesa di San Giovanni Fuorcivitas | Pistoia, Tuscany |  Gargantuan black-and-white striped marble facade aside, the star turn of this striking Romanesque church fronting Via Cavour is Luca della Robbia's glazed terracotta Visitation (1445), portraying Elizabeth, about to become mother to John the Baptist, affectionately kneeling in front of a younger pregnant Mary. The women's blue eyes provide a powerful contrast to the milky-white terracotta.
