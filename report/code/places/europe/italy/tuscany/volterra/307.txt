Fortezza Medicea | Volterra, Tuscany |  The 14th-century Fortezza Medicea, later altered by Lorenzo Il Magnifico, is nowadays a prison (admission: one felony), but the 'Nuova Fortezza' within the prison complex, a 15th-century square-shaped structure with its cylindrical tower, can be visited. Expect lots of stairs.
