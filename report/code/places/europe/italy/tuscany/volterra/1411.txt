Palazzo dei Priori | Volterra, Tuscany |  Volterra's 13th-century town hall is the oldest seat of local government in Tuscany. The staircase bears a fresco of the Crucifixion by Pier Francesco Fiorentino and there's a magnificent cross-vaulted council hall. The bell tower was significantly rebuilt in the 19th century; get to the top either by lift or 52 narrow steps. Sadly, the views are obscured by wire netting.
