Fortezza Nuova | Livorno, Tuscany |  Built for the Medicis between 1590 and 1604, this hulk of a red-brick fort in Piccola Venezia is a pale shade of its 17th-century magnificent self. Abandoned and overgrown, its sturdy outer walls shelter a ramshackle park with a handful of benches, unkempt children's playground and pretty views of 'Little Venice's surrounding canals.
