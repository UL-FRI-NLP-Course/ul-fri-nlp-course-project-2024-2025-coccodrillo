Orto Botanico | Lucca, Tuscany |  Tucked across the walkway from the Baluardo San Regolo are Lucca's pretty botanical gardens, well worth a meander and a contemplative moment in the shade of its magnificent Lebanese cedar tree planted in 1820.
A combination ticket covering the Torre del'Ore or Torre Guinigi costs €6/4 (or €9/6 for all three sights).
