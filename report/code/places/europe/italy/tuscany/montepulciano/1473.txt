Duomo | Montepulciano, Tuscany |  Montepulciano's 16th-century duomo is striking, largely because its unfinished facade gives the building a stern, heavily weathered look. Inside, don't miss Taddeo di Bartolo's ornate Assumption triptych (1401) behind the high altar and Sano di Pietro's Madonna del pilastro (Madonna of the Pillar; 15th century) on the eastern wall of the nave.
