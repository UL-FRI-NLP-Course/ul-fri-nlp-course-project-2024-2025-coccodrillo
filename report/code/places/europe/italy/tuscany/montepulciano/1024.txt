Museo Civico & Pinacoteca Crociani | Montepulciano, Tuscany |  It was a curatorial dream come true: in 2011 a painting in the collection of this modest art gallery was attributed to Caravaggio. The work, Portrait of a Man, is thought to portray Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the artist's patron. Itâ€™s now accompanied by a touch-screen interpretation that allows you to explore details of the painting, its restoration and diagnostic attribution. Other works here include two terracottas by Andrea Della Robbia, and Domenico Beccafumi's painting of the town's patron saint, Agnese.
