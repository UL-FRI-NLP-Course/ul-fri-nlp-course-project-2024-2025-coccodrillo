Museo Civico Isernia | Molise, Italy |  World War II doesn’t get a lot of coverage in Italy, which makes this small museum chronicling the events of 10 September 1943, when Isernia was heavily bombed by the Allies, all the more interesting. Old photos, discarded possessions of American, British and German soldiers, and stories of local heroism add to the poignancy.
It’s next door to the info centre.
