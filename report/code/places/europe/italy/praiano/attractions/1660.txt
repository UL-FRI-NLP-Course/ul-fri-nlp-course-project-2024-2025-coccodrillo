Spiaggia della Gavitelli | Praiano, Italy |  Accessible by a steep staircase (with 300 steps) from the village of Praiano or by boat from Marina di Praia, Gavitelli is a tiny but popular affair with a private beach club and a decent restaurant plying potent cocktails. As one of the coast’s few west-facing beaches, it’s a lovely spot to watch the sunset.
