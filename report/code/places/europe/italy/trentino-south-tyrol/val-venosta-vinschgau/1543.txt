Glorenza | Trentino & South Tyrol, Italy |  A walled medieval town, Glorenza (Glurns) was once a kingpin in the regionâ€™s salt trade. Its pristine burgher houses, colonnaded shops, town gates, fortifications and ramparts were faithfully restored in the 1970s, and while it's certainly picturesque, it retains a comforting normalcy, with the road to Switzerland passing through its very centre.
