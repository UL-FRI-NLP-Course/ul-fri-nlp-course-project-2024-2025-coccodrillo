Segheria Veneziana dei Bègoi | Trentino & South Tyrol, Italy |  This working 18th-century 'Venetian sawmill', powered by the rushing waters of the Torrente Rabbiés and built according to a design reputedly conceived by Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the valley's most prized historical features. In summer, free guided tours allow visitors to watch its ingenious hydraulic mechanisms sawing wood in rapid-fire motion; consult the park office for exact hours.
