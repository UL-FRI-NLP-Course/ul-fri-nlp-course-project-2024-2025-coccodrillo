Messner Mountain Museum Ripa | The Dolomites, Trentino & South Tyrol |  Brunico's 13th-century hilltop castle is the evocative setting for mountaineer Reinhold Messner's fifth 'Mountain Museum'. Opened in 2011, it documents the cultures of mountain peoples on four continents (Asia, Africa, South America and Europe). Displays range from photographs, textiles and furniture to a traditional tent used by yak-herding Tibetan nomads and a reconstructed Tyrolean farm kitchen.
