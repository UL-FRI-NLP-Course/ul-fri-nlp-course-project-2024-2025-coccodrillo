Kriegerfriedhof | The Dolomites, Trentino & South Tyrol |  This pristinely maintained cemetery set in a forest on KÃ¼hbergl just behind the town has graves of soldiers from the nearby WWI front as well as a section of WWII dead. Most of the WWI soldiers buried here are from the Slavic regions of the old Austro-Hungarian empire, and there are Christian, Muslim and Jewish graves. It's a peaceful and solemn place.
