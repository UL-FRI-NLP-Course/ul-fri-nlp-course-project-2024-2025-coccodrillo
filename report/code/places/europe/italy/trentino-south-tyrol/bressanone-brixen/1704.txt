Chiesetta di San Giovanni in Ranui | The Dolomites, Trentino & South Tyrol |  Sitting alone in a meadow below the gargantuan spiky peaks of the Odle mountain group, this tiny and almost impossibly picturesque onion-steepled church (built in 1744) is one of the Dolomites' most iconic photo-ops. Look for it about 1km east (and uphill) from the village of Santa Maddalena di Funes.
