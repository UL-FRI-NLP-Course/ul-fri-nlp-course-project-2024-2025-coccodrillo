Diözesanmuseum | The Dolomites, Trentino & South Tyrol |  This museum is far more interesting than most of its ilk, and its magnificent palazzo (mansion) home testament to Bressanone's once-important religious standing. It's popular when the Christmas market crowds arrive, due to its extensive, and rather bonkers, ‘crib’ collection – nativity figures and dioramas.
