Kalterer See | Trentino & South Tyrol, Italy |  The Weinstrasse's little Lake Kaltern may look rather small compared to Northern Italy's splendid collection of lakes, but up close it's a stunningly pretty little pond, fringed with old-style boat sheds, with walkways skirting over water lilies, and lots of lakeside spots for lunch or a drink.
