Fontana delle 99 Cannelle | Abruzzo, Italy |  L'Aquila's erroneously named 'fountain of 99 spouts' (there are actually only 93 of them) was one of the few monuments to quickly reopen after the earthquake. It was formerly a communal laundry site, but is now a place for picnic lunches and wedding photos.
