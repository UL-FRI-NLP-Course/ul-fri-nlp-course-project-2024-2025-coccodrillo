Basilica di San Bernardino | Abruzzo, Italy |  A marvel of post-earthquake restoration, the 15th-century San Bernardino gleams like a salvaged Titanic brought to the surface to sail once more. Position yourself under the huge central dome to fully admire the richly embroidered ceiling, the grand gold-leafed organ above the main door, and the relics of San Bernardino of Siena encased in an elaborate mausoleum.
Amazingly this is not the churchâ€™s first miraculous rebirth. It was savaged by a previous earthquake in 1703 after which it was largely rebuilt in the baroque style.
