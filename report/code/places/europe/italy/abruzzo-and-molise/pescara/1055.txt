Museo delle Genti d'Abruzzo | Pescara, Italy |  An extensive (if slightly dated) display of Abruzzo culture that squeezes rather a lot into 13 interconnecting rooms, covering the Bronze Age to the Risorgimento and beyond. The labelling is mainly in Italian with some sporadic English and the presentation is, at times, a little cluttered. But there’s a lot of history backed up by exhibits of a more folkloric bent (including numerous costumes). Most illuminating is the little-told story of Abruzzo’s Italic shepherd warriors who gave the peninsula its name.
