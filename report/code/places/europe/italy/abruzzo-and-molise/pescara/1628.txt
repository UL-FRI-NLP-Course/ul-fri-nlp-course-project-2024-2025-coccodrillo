Museo d'Arte Moderna Vittoria Colonna | Pescara, Italy |  In a country as art-heavy as Italy, this small, not particularly attractive building close to the seafront isn't what you'd call a big hitter, although it does have a Picasso and Mir√≥ among its small collection of modern art. Only worth a brief pit stop, unless there is a seriously interesting temporary exhibition showing.
