Museo dell'Arte Confettiera | Abruzzo, Italy |  This museum is housed in the Fabbrica Confetti Pelino (established 1783), Sulmona's most famous manufacturer of confetti (the confectionery product, as opposed to the paper you throw at weddings). With its antique sweet-making equipment, the reconstructed laboratory looks more like an old-time science lab than a sweet-making plant.
