Centro di Visita di Pescasseroli | Abruzzo, Italy |  The Centro di Visita di Pescasseroli has an Apennine garden and a clinic for rescued animals who can no longer live in the wild on their own. Accommodated on site are two Marsican bears and a wolf (the only ones you're likely to see, unless you're extremely lucky). It also acts as an information portal and small museum with exhibits covering archaeology, flora, caves and a short video on bear conservation.
