Casa Noha | Matera, Italy |  Highly recommended as a precursor to visiting the sassi themselves, this wonderful 25-minute multimedia exhibit, spread across three rooms of a 16th-century family home donated to the Fondo Ambiente Italiano, relates the astonishing and often painful social history of the town and its sassi. Your appreciation of Matera's unique history and renaissance, and the tribulations of the sassi dwellers, will be transformed.
