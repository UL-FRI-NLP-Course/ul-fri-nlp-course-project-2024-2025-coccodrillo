Belvedere | Matera, Italy |  For a great photograph of the sassi, take the Tarantoâ€“Laterza road (SS7) and follow signs for the chiese rupestri. This road takes you to the Belvedere, the location of the crucifixion in The Passion of the Christ, which has fantastic views of the plunging ravine and Matera. It's especially impressive at sunset.
