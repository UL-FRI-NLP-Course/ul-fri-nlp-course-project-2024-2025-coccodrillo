Museo Nazionale del Bergamotto | Reggio Calabria, Italy |  Housed in Reggio's former covered market, this museum, which opened in 2018, showcases the interesting 300-year-old history of the region's bergamot growing industry. The zesty citrus fruit is grown almost exclusively in the Reggio and Aspromonte area. Sample the essential oils and bergamot-infused teas before trying bergamotto gelato at Reggio's beloved CÃ¨sare gelateria.
