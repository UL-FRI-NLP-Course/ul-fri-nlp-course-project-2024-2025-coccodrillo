Basilica di San Domenico | Perugia, Umbria |  Erected in the early 14th century, Umbria's largest church is an imposing vision, with its distinctive bell tower and a 17th-century interior lit by immense stained-glass windows. The basilica's pride and joy is the Gothic tomb of Pope Benedict XI, who died after eating poisoned figs in 1304.
