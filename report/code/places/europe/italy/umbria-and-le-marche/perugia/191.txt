Piazza IV Novembre | Perugia, Umbria |  In Perugia all roads seem to lead to Piazza IV Novembre. This historic square, flanked by Palazzo dei Priori and the Cattedrale, has been at the heart of civic life since it was the Roman forum and later the political and geographic centre of the medieval city. Nowadays, people from all walks of life gather here to sit on the cathedral steps, soak up the sun and watch the street entertainers work their magic.
