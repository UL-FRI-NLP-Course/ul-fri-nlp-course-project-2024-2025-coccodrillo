Capella di San Severo | Perugia, Umbria |  From the outside, this rather bland church northeast of Piazza IV Novembre looks nothing special. But step inside and you'll find a tiny chapel decorated with a fresco by Raphael. Trinit√† e santi (Trinity with Saints), which was painted during the artist's residence in Perugia between 1505 and 1508 and later completed by his mentor Perugino, is the only painting by Raphael in Perugia.
