Chiesa di San Pietro | Spoleto, Umbria |  This big landmark church overlooks the main Via Flaminia (SS3) just outside the southern end of town. A fine example of Romanesque architecture, it was built in the early 13th century over an earlier temple dedicated to St Peter. A characteristic feature is its imposing facade, which is liberally bedecked with sculpted animals and figures illustrating episodes from the saint's life and medieval morality tales.
