Rocca Albornoziana | Spoleto, Umbria |  Dominating the skyline above Spoleto, this formidable fortress was built on the summit of Colle Santâ€™Elia as part of a 14th-century campaign to reassert papal authority over central Italy. Nowadays, it houses the Museo Nazionale del Ducato, a small museum tracing the history of the Spoleto duchy through a series of Roman, Byzantine, Carolingian and Lombard artefacts, ranging from 5th-century sarcophagi to Byzantine jewellery.
