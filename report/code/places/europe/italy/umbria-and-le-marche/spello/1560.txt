Villa dei Mosaici di Spello | Umbria, Italy |  Just outside the historic centre, this cracking little museum showcases a series of floor mosaics unearthed at a Roman villa in 2005. Raised walkways allow you to look at the polychrome mosaics, all in situ and some depicting wild animals and mythical creatures, while screen displays illustrate what the villa would originally have looked like.
