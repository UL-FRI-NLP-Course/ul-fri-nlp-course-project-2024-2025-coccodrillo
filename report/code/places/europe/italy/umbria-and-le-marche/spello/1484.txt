Chiesa di Santa Maria Maggiore | Umbria, Italy |  The impressive 12th-century Chiesa di Santa Maria Maggiore houses Spello's main draw â€“ a wonderful cycle of frescoes by the Perugia-born artist Pinturicchio. These beautiful works adorn the Cappella Baglioni, depicting episodes from the the life of Christ. When in the chapel, look down as well as up to admire its 16th-century Deruta majolica floor.
