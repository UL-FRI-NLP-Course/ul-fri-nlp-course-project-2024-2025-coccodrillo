Tomb of St Francis | Assisi, Umbria |  Hidden for almost 600 years, St Francis' tomb was discovered beneath the Basilica di San Francesco in 1818 following a 52-day dig, and painstakingly restored in 2011. You'll find the stone sarcophagus containing the saint's remains in the Cripta di San Francecso in the Basilica Inferiore.
