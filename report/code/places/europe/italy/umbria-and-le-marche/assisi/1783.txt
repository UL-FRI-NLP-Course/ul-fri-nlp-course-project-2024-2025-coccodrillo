Chiesa Nuova | Assisi, Umbria |  Just southeast of Piazza del Comune, this baroque domed church is a peaceful place for contemplation. It was built by King Philip III of Spain in 1615 over the remains of a house reputed to be the home of St Francis' family. A bronze statue of the saint's parents stands outside.
