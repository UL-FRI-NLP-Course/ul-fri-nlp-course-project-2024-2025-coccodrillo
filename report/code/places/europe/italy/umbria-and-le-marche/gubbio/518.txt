Palazzo Ducale | Umbria, Italy |  The 15th-century Palazzo Ducale was built by the Duke of Montefeltroâ€™s family as a scaled-down version of their palatial residence in Urbino. Its walls hide an impressive Renaissance courtyard, built over an earlier medieval piazza, and excavated vestiges of pre-existing medieval buildings. Inside, works by 13th- to 18th-century Umbrian artists hang in the airy halls.
