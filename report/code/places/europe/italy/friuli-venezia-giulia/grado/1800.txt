Spiaggia Principale | Grado, Italy |  Grado's main beach is a 3km-long sandy strip facing due south. The beach shelves gently into shallow waters making it perfect for families, and lifeguards are always on duty. Loungers and umbrellas line the shore and there's a bar, a children's playground and hot showers.
