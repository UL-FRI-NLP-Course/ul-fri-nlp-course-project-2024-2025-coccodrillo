Costa Azzurra Beach | Grado, Italy |  The westernmost beach in Grado is at the tip of the island and has been serving holidaymakers for centuries. It's free to access it although there are concessions where you can rent deck chairs, sunbeds and beach umbrellas. It's also popular with children thanks to the play areas set out beneath the trees.
