Museo del Duomo | Udine, Italy |  Housed in a couple of smaller chapels of the cathedral is the Museo del Duomo, which hosts a collection of objects relating to the period of the Patriarch in Udine. Frescoes by Vitale da Bologna decorate the walls and in the baptistry is a beautifully carved sarcophagus balanced on the heads of five zen-like saints. It dates to 1348 and is a masterpiece of the period.
