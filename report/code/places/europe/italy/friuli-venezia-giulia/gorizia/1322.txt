Castello di Gorizia | Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy |  Gorizia's main sight is its castle; perched atop a knoll-like hill it has served as a fortress, barracks and prison. It has some convincing recreations and a fine wood-panelled great hall, and the panoramic views from the windows are impressive, taking in the gentle slopes of the Collio and the winding Isonzo river. The castle is a popular venue for cultural initiatives and often hosts exhibitions and re-enactments.
