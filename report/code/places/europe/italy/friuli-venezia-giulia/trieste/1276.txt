Castello di San Giusto | Trieste, Italy |  Once a Roman fort, this sturdy 15th-century castle was begun by Frederick of Habsburg and finished off by blow-in Venetians. The city museum is housed here, with temporary exhibitions and a well-stocked armoury. Wander around the walls for magnificent views. To reach it, take the lift at the back of the underground car park to the right of the Roman Theatre, which exits at the castle, or bus 24.
