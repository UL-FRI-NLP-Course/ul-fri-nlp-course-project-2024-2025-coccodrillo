Civico Museo Sartorio | Trieste, Italy |  This elegant urban villa set in a large garden belonged to the haute bourgeoisie Sartorio family, who amassed a huge collection of art, ceramics and jewellery in once-trendy Empire, Biedermeier and neo-Gothic styles. The house itself is similarly opulent with a genuine Roman mosaic in the basement and a glyptotheque for the sculpture collection. Don't miss the room of superb Tiepolo drawings or the Triptych of Santa Chiara, an exquisitely detailed wooden altarpiece from the 14th century.
