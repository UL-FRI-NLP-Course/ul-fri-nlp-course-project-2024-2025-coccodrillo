Palazzo Sanfelice | Naples, Italy |  Ferdinando Sanfeliceâ€™s debut staircase is this double-ramped diva inside the Palazzo Sanfelice. Upon its completion in 1726 it became the talk of the town, and from then on there was no stopping Sanfelice, who perfected his dramatic design in various palazzi across the city, culminating in his masterpiece at the Palazzo dello Spagnuolo.
