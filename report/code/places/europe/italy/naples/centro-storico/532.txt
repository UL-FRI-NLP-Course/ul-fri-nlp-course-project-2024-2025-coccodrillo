Porta San Gennaro | Naples, Italy |  Just up from Cavour metro station, a clamorous alley juts off Via Foria through the grey ashlar keyhole of Naplesâ€™ oldest gate. Ethereal images by Mattia Preti are frescoed into a soaring, marble-framed niche. A saintly petition for protection from the plague, the Virgin Mary is flanked by San Gennaro and Saint Francis Xavier.
