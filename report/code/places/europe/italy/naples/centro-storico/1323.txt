Chiesa di Sant'Angelo a Nilo | Naples, Italy |  This modest 14th-century church houses one of the first great artworks to grace the Neapolitan Renaissance â€“ the majestic tomb of Cardinal Rinaldo Brancaccio, the church's founder. Although considered a part of Naples' artistic heritage, the sarcophagus was actually sculpted in Pisa by Donatello, Michelozzo and Pagno di Lapo Portigiani. Taking a year to complete, the chiselled marvel was shipped to Naples in 1427.
