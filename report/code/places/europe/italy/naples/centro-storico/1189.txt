Made in Cloister | Naples, Italy |  Made in Cloister is a newly restored Renaissance cloister and exhibition space. Approached through a conspicuous door to the right of the Santa Caterina a Formiello church, it typifies the notion that much of Naples' splendour is hidden behind closed doors. The cloister is framed with wall frescoes and at the centre is a spectacular industrial wooden truss, which was erected when the building was a wool factory and now serves as a covering for art installations.
