Zhao | Naples, Italy |  In a tiny studio opened with a giant 18th-century key, sculptor and painter Salvatore Vitagliano takes fragments of ancient terracotta figurines and completes them, creating simple yet striking works that literally fuse old and new. This theme of ‘temporal collision’ extends to his Neapolitan playing cards, handpainted onto metro tickets. Call ahead to visit, though it’s worth noting that Salvatore doesn’t speak English.
