La Pignasecca | Naples, Italy |  Naples' oldest street market is a multisensory escapade into a world of wriggling seafood, fragrant delis and clued-up casalinghe (homemakers) on the hunt for perfect produce. Fresh produce aside, the market's street-side stalls flog everything from discounted perfume and linen to Neapolitan hip-hop CDs and oh-so-snug nonna slippers.
