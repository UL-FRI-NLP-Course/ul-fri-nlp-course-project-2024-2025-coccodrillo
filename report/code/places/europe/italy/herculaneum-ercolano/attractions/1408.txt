Casa del Tramezzo di Legno | Bay of Naples, Italy |  Unusually, this house features two atria, which likely belonged to two separate dwellings that were merged in the 1st century AD. The most famous relic here is a wonderfully well-preserved wooden screen, separating the atrium from the tablinum, where the owner talked business with his clients. The second room off the left side of the atrium features the remains of an ancient bed.
