Casa di Nettuno e Anfitrite | Bay of Naples, Italy |  This aristocratic pad takes its name from the extraordinary mosaic in the triclinium (dining room), which also features a mosaic-encrusted nymphaeum (fountain and bath as a shrine to the water nymph). The warm colours in which the sea god and his nymph bride are depicted hint at how lavish the original interior must have been.
