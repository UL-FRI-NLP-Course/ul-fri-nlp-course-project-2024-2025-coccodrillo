Terme Femminili | Bay of Naples, Italy |  A quick walk along Cardo IV leads you to the women's section of the Terme del Foro, the Terme Femminili. Though smaller than its male equivalent, it boasts finer floor mosaics â€“ note the beautifully executed naked figure of Triton in the apodyterium (changing room).
