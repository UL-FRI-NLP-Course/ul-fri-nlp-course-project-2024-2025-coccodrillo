Scuola dei Battuti | The Veneto, Italy |  The eye-catching Scuola dei Battuti is covered inside and out with 16th-century frescoes by Ludovico Pozzoserrato. The building was once home to a religious lay group known as battuti (beaters) for their enthusiastic self-flagellation. The interior sala is only open to the public at the weekend, though visits on other days can be arranged by calling ahead.
