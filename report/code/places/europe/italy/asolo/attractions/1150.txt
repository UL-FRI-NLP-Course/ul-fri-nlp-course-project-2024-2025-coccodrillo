Villa Freya | The Veneto, Italy |  When she wasnâ€™t exploring the furthest reaches of the Empty Quarter or negotiating with future Arab heads of state, legendary explorer and travel writer Freya Stark retired to Asolo to tend her flower-filled gardens. Inevitably she brought back exotic botanical specimens, which still thrive on the sunny slopes that originally formed part of a Roman theatre complex. The ticket price includes a guided tour by BellAsolo at 10am and 11am.
