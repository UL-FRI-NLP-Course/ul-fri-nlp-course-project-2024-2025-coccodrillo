Museo Archeologico Nazionale Tarquiniense | Lazio, Italy |  This charming museum, beautifully housed in the 15th-century Palazzo Vitelleschi, is a treasure trove of locally found Etruscan artefacts. Highlights include the Cavalli Alati, a magnificent frieze of two winged horses, and, in the next room, the Mitra Tauroctono, a striking sculpture of the headless, handless god Mithras killing a bull.
