Parco Villa Gregoriana | Tivoli, Lazio |  This scenic park, laid out by Pope Gregory XVI in 1834, cascades down a steep, thickly wooded gorge overlooked by a 2nd-century BC Roman temple. Paths lead to grottoes and panoramic viewing points, including one looking up to the 120m-high Cascata Grande, one of Italy's tallest waterfalls.
