Parco dei Mostri | Viterbo, Lazio |  Some 17km north of Viterbo at Bomarzo, the Parco dei Mostri is an eccentric folly that will entertain kids and adults alike. The brainchild of Vicino Orsini, Bomarzo's 16th-century ruler, the wooded park is populated by a strange and surreal cast of sculpted ogres, dragons, giants and animals.
