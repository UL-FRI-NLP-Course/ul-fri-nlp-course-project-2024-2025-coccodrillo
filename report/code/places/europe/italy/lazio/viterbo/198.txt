Palazzo Farnese | Viterbo, Lazio |  In Caprarola, 20km southeast of Viterbo, this lordly 16th-century palazzo is a true Renaissance wonder. It features a distinct pentagonal design and, inside, an internal circular courtyard and extraordinary columned staircase. Visits take in the richly decorated rooms frescoed by some of Italy's finest mannerist artists, and, on weekdays, the beautiful hillside gardens.
