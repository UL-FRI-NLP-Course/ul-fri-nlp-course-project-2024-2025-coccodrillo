Museo Nazionale Etrusco | Viterbo, Lazio |  The Albornaz fortress, built in the 14th century to guard the city and later modified by Renaissance architect Bramante, houses Viterbo's modest Etruscan museum. Reconstructions and locally found artefacts illustrate the Etruscan lifestyle, while a series of life-sized statues harks back to the city's Roman past.
