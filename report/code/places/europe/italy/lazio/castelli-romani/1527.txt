Nemi | Castelli Romani, Lazio |  The small town of Nemi is perched high above Lago di Nemi, the smaller of the two volcanic lakes in the Castelli Romani. This area was the centre of a cult to the goddess Diana in ancient times, and a favourite holiday spot of the emperor Caligula. Today itâ€™s a popular getaway from Rome, and famous for its wild strawberries, best eaten in early summer.
