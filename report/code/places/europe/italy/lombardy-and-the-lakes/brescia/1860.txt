Palazzo del Broletto | Brescia, The Italian Lakes |  The medieval town hall looms large over the plaza down below thanks to its soaring brick tower, which was built in the 12th century. Other parts of the palazzo date from later periods â€“ with much rebuilding required after the sack of Brescia in 1512.
