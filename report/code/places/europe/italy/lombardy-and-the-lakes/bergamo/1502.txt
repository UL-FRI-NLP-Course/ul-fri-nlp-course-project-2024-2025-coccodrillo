Cattedrale di Bergamo | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  Roman remains were discovered during renovations of Bergamo's baroque cathedral, with an interior dating to the 17th century. A rather squat building, it has a brilliant white facade (completed in the 19th century). Among the relics in a side chapel is the one-time coffin of the beatified Pope John XXII. The church also contains paintings by Moroni and Tiepolo.
