Chiesa di San Bernardino | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  Worth a visit for Lorenzo Lottoâ€™s stylistically evolved altarpiece, the Pala di San Bernardino (1521), which depicts the Madonna beneath a dynamic, foreshortened canopy deep in intense conversation with her saintly companions.
Note the church's opening hours are very limited.
