Chiesa di San Michele al Pozzo Bianco | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  This dark chilly church is home to an entire Lorenzo Lotto fresco-cycle devoted to the Storie della Vergine (Stories of the Virgin Mother; 1525). Curiously enough, Lotto lived next door to the church in the Casa del Vicario (House of the Vicar), which today belongs to the Ursuline Sisters.
You'll need to stick a coin in a slot to fully illuminate Lotto's deft handiwork.
