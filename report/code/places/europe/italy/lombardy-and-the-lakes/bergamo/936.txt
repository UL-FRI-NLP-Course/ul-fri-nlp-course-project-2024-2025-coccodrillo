Palazzo della Ragione | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  The imposing arches and columns of the Palazzo della Ragione sit at the southern end of Piazza Vecchia. Built in the 12th century, it bears the lion of St Mark â€“ a reminder of Venice's long reign here. The animal is actually an early-20th-century replica of the 15th-century original, which was torn down when Napoleon took over in 1797. Note the sun clock in the pavement beneath the arches and the curious Romanesque and Gothic animals and busts decorating the pillars.
The palazzo houses temporary exhibitions. Enter via the steps leading up on the right.
