Torre del Campanone | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  Bergamo's colossal, square-based Torre del Campanone soars 52m above the city. It still tolls a bell at 10pm, the legacy of an old curfew. Taking the lift to the top of the tower reveals sweeping views down onto the town, up to the pre-Alps and across to the Lombard plains.
There's a 230-step staircase if you're feeling energetic.Entry also includes the Palazzo del Podest√†.
