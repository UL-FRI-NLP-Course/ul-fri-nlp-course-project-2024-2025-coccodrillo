Chiesa del Santo Spirito | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  Look for the Venetian-inspired countryside and colour palette that defines Lorenzo Lotto's Pala di Santo Spirito (1521), where the Madonna sits beneath a garland of energetic winged putti (cherubs). It's on the right-hand side as you face the altar.
