Palazzo Nuovo | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  The white, porticoed Palazzo Nuovo defines the northern side of Piazza Vecchia. Designed in 1611 by a brilliant architectural mind from Vicenza, Vincenzo Scamozzi (1548â€“1616), it was not actually completed until 1928. Long the seat of the town hall, it's been a library since 1873.
