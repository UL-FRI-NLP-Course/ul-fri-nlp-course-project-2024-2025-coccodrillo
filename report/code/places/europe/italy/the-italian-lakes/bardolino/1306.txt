Museo del Vino | Lake Garda, The Italian Lakes |  Just off the main lake road and walkable from town, the Museo del Vino is set within the Zeni Winery, and rarely has a museum smelt this good. Rich scents waft around displays of wicker grape baskets, coopers' tools, drying racks and gigantic timber grape presses. Tastings of Zeni's red, white and ros√© wines are free, or pay to sample pricier vintages, including barrel-aged Amarone.
