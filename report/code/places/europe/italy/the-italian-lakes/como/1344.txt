Broletto | Como, The Italian Lakes |  The polychromatic Broletto, or medieval town hall, sits right beside Como's towering duomo. Unusually, it butts right up against the cathedral and is very much overwhelmed by it â€“ the Broletto was built in 1215, but shortened in 1477 to make room for enlargements to the cathedral (a singular defeat for lay power).
The Broletto generally opens to the public only during special exhibitions.
