Parco Arciducale | Lake Garda, The Italian Lakes |  No doubt avoiding the summer tourists, Archduke Albrecht preferred to build his winter palace 5km north of Riva in pretty Arco in 1872. Around it he created a magnificent arboretum, now the Parco Arciducale, planted with huge holm-oaks, sequoias and dagger-sharp cypresses.
