Museo Alto Garda | Lake Garda, The Italian Lakes |  Housed in Riva's compact medieval castle, the civic museum features local archaeology, frescoes from Roman Riva, documents and paintings. In light of Riva's much-fought-over past, perhaps the most revealing exhibits are the antique maps dating from 1579 and 1667, and a 1774 Atlas Tyrolensis, which evocatively convey the area's shifting boundaries.
