Villa Cipressi Botanical Gardens | Lake Como, The Italian Lakes |  The villa itself is a hotel, but the steeply terraced grounds are open to anyone willing to part with â‚¬6. The gardens bloom with cipressi (cypress trees), palms, magnolias and camellias on terraces that descend to the lake. Gravel paths connect fountains, statues and terraces. When the weather cooperates it's a sublime scene.
You can take the Cipressi experience to the next level by booking a night in one of the villa's plush rooms.
