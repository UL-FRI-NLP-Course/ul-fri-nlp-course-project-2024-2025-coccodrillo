Rotonda della Besana | Milan, The Italian Lakes |  It’s said this former cemetery to the poor was once the burial site for nearly 150,000 people. Now it’s the charming setting for a picnic, read or wander, and houses the children’s museum MUBA along with a chic cafe. It’s round (as the name suggests), in late baroque style with a repurposed chapel at the centre and charming porticos lining its walls.
