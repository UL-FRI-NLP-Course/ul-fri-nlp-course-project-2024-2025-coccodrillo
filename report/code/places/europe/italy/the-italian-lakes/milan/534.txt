Torre Branca | Milan, The Italian Lakes |  Giò Ponti's spindly 1933 steel tower (built in two months flat for a Triennale exhibition) provides a fantastic 108m-high viewing platform over Parco Sempione. Take the lift up at sunset, or at night to watch the city lights twinkle, and lord it over the Cavalli Café crowd below.
