Laveno Funivia | Lake Maggiore, The Italian Lakes |  A highlight of Laveno is the Funivia, which whisks passengers up to a panoramic spot 949m above sea level, in the shadow of the Sasso del Ferro peak (1062m). The views over the lake and beyond to the Alps are breathtaking.
From there, you can head off on longer walks into the hills. Stop by the tourist office for suggested itineraries.
