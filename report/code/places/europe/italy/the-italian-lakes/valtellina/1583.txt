Tirano | Lake Como & Around, The Italian Lakes |  The prettiest town along the valley floor is Tirano, terminus for trains arriving from Milan via Lake Como and others arriving from Switzerland. At its east end is the quiet old town, with winding lanes next to the gushing Adda. About 1.5km west of the centre stands the proud Renaissance Santuario della Madonna church.
