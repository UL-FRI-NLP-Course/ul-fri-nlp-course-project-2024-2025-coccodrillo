Chiesa San Pietro in Mavino | Sirmione, The Italian Lakes |  Sirmione's oldest church and its crumbling bell tower date from the 14th century, though it was built on the site of a much older temple. The surprisingly vivid frescoes inside also date from the same period, but the attraction here is the peaceful setting on the top of a knoll surrounded by cypress trees and guarded by a poignant war memorial.
