Chiesa di San Martino | Lake Como, The Italian Lakes |  One of the oldest churches on Lake Como, St Martin's dates from the 11th century, and its stolid brick bell tower makes a photogenic backdrop against the lake. The church is rarely open, though you can ask for keys (to the two separate locks) at the nearby Trattoria al Porto.
