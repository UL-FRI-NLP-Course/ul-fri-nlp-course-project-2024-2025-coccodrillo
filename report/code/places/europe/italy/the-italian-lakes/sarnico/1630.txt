Castello del Grumello | Lake Iseo, The Italian Lakes |  A 9km detour southwest of Sarnico brings you to Grumello del Monte, dominated by a partly overgrown Castello del Grumello, now part of a winery where you can book guided tours with a glass of produce thrown in. Indeed, this is one of northern Italy's lesser-known wine areas, the Valcalepio.
