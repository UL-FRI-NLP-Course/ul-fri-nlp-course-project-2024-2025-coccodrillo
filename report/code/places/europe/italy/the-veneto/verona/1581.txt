Arche Scaligere | Verona, Italy |  Walk through the archway at the far end of Piazza dei Signori to these ornate Gothic funerary monuments, the elaborate tombs of the Della Scala family, in front of the little Santa Maria Antica church. In the courtyard behind the Arche, have a look at the scavi (excavation work) that's been done on this part of medieval Verona.
