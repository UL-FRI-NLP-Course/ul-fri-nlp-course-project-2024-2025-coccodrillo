Duomo | The Veneto, Italy |  The highlight of this cathedral is Giorgione's celebrated altarpiece known as the Castelfranco Madonna. Born in Castelfranco Veneto as Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco, Giorgione was one of the great masters of the High Renaissance, revolutionising painting before dying aged 30 of the plague. The altarpiece, one of his few surviving works, hangs in the Cappella Costanza.
