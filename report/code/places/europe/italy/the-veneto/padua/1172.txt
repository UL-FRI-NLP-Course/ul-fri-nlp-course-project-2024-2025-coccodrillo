Oratorio di San Giorgio & Scuola del Santo | Padua, Italy |  Anywhere else, the fresco cycle of the Oratorio di San Giorgio and the paintings in the Scuola del Santo would be considered highlights, but in Padua they must contend with Giotto's Scrovegni brilliance. This means you'll have Altichiero da Zevio and Jacopo Avanzi's jewel-like, 14th-century frescoes of St George, St Lucy and St Catherine all to yourself, while upstairs in the scuola (confraternity house), Titian paintings are seldom viewed in such tranquillity.
