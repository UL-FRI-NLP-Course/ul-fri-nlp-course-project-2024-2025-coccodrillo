Teatro Olimpico | Vicenza, Italy |  Behind a walled garden lies a Renaissance marvel: the Teatro Olimpico, which Palladio began in 1580 with inspiration from Roman amphitheatres. Vincenzo Scamozzi finished the elliptical theatre after Palladioâ€™s death, adding a stage set modelled on the ancient Greek city of Thebes, with streets built in steep perspective to give the illusion of a city sprawling towards a distant horizon.
Today, Italian performers vie to make an entrance on this extraordinary stage; check the website for opera, classical and jazz performances.
