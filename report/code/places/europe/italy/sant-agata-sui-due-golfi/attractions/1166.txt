Convento del Deserto | Santâ€™Agata sui Due Golfi, Italy |  This hulking convent is located 1.5km uphill from the village centre. It was founded in the 17th century by Carmelite friars, but since 1983 it has been home to a closed community of Benedictine nuns. While the convent is of only moderate interest, the 360-degree views from the belvedere (rooftop terrace) really make the knee-wearying hike worthwhile.
If the door to the belvedere is closed during opening hours, ring the bell beside it to be let in.
