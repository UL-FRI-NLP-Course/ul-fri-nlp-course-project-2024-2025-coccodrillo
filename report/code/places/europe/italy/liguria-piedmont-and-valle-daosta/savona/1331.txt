Fortezza del Priamàr | Savona, Italy |  Among Savona's treasures to survive destruction by Genoese forces in the 16th century is the lumbering Fortezza del Priamàr. This imposing fortress, which has suffered some years of neglect, guards several small museums including the Civico Museo Storico Archeologico. The citadel also has various terraces overlooking the seaside, an overgrown playground and a small cafe.
