Piazza Castello | Turin, Italy |  Turin's central square is lined with museums, theatres and cafes. The city's Savoy heart, although laid out from the mid-1300s, was mostly constructed from the 16th to 18th centuries. Dominating it is the part-medieval, part-baroque Palazzo Madama, the original seat of the Italian parliament. To the north is the exquisite facade of Palazzo Reale, the royal palace built for Carlo Emanuele II in the mid-1600s.
