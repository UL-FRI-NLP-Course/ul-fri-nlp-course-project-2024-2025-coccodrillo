Parco Valentino | Turin, Italy |  Opened in 1856, this 550,000-sq-metre French-style park kisses the banks of the Po and is filled with joggers, promenaders and lovers night and day. Walking southwest along the river brings you to Castello del Valentino (open for events only), a gorgeous mock ch√¢teau built in the 17th century. The park is also home to the Borgo Medievale, a recreated medieval village.
