Fondazione Merz | Turin, Italy |  The Arte Povera powerhouse, Mario Merz, was born in Milan but spent most of his creative life in Turin. This foundation space, an evocative reworking of the former Lancia heating plant, holds regular exhibitions of his work and an astute program of Italian contemporary art. It also hosts concerts, poetry slams, author readings and other cultural fare (the majority of which are admission-free).
