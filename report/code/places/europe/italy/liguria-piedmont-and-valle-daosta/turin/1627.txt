Borgo Medievale | Turin, Italy |  Perched over a scenic stretch of the Po River, the Borgo Medievale is a small recreated 15th-century village that was actually built for the 1884 Turin Expo. Enter via the drawbridge, then wander amid gardens, arcades, artisan shops and trickling fountains beneath imposing crenellated castle walls. It's a hit with families.
