Castello Doria | Porto Venere, Italy |  No one knows when the original castle was built, though the current structure – a formidable example of Genoese military architecture – dates from the 16th century. A highly strategic citadel in its time, it once stood on the front line with Genoa's maritime feud with Pisa. Aside from admiring the fine construction, there isn't much to see inside, but views from the terraced gardens are magnificent.
