Parco Nazionale dell' Appennino Tosco-Emiliano | Emilia-Romagna, Italy |  Established in 2001 and made a Unesco Man and Biosphere Reserve in 2015, this 260-sq-km parcel of land straddles the border between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. The park boasts rich biodiversity, sandwiched as it is between the Continental and Mediterranean climatic zones. It runs along the spine of the Apennine mountains, offering a wealth of hiking opportunities, extensive beech forests and a small population of wolves.
