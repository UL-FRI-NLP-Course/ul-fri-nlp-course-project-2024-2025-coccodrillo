Quartiere Ellenistico-Romano | Agrigento, Sicily |  To the east of the Museo Archeologico is the Hellenistic-Roman Quarter, featuring a well-preserved street layout which was part of urban Akragas (and later, under the Romans, Agrigentum). The regular grid is made up of main streets (plateiai) intersected at right angles by secondary streets (stenopoi), all of which were laid out towards the end of the 4th century BC.
