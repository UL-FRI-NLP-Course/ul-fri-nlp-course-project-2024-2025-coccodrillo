Museo Archeologico | Agrigento, Sicily |  North of the temples, this wheelchair-accessible museum is one of Sicily's finest, with a huge collection of clearly labelled artefacts from the excavated site. Noteworthy are the dazzling displays of Greek painted ceramics and the awe-inspiring reconstructed telamon, a colossal statue recovered from the nearby Tempio di Giove.
