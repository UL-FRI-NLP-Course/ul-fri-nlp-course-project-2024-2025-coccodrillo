Chiesa di San Giovanni degli Eremiti | Palermo, Sicily |  One of Palermo's finest examples of Arab-Norman architecture, this five-domed, 12th-century church is named for Sicilian hermit-monk and miraculous wolf tamer St William of Montervergine. Surrounded by a garden of citrus trees, palms, cacti and rosemary bushes, the church is built atop a mosque that itself was superimposed on a 6th-century Benedictine chapel. The tranquil grounds also house the ruins of the monastery's Norman-era cloister.
