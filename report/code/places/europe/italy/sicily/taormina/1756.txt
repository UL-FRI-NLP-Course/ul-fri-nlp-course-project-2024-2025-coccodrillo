Isola Bella | Taormina, Sicily |  Southwest of Lido Mazzar√≤ is the minuscule Isola Bella, a beautiful nature reserve set in a stunning cove with fishing boats. Reached on foot via a narrow sandbar (take your shoes off!), the island was once home to Englishwoman Florence Trevelyan, creator of Taormina's Villa Comunale.
