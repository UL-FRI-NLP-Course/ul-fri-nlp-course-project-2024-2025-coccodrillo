Palazzo Duca di Santo Stefano | Taormina, Sicily |  Just behind Corso Umberto and near Porta Catania, this 13th-century palace was once home to the De Spuches, a noble family of Spanish origin. Now used as a functions space, its Norman Gothic windows and Arab accents make it one of Taormina's architectural pin-ups.
