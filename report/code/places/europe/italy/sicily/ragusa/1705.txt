Millo Mural | Ragusa, Sicily |  Via Vittorio Alfieri is home to a giant street-art mural by Italian artist Francesco Camillo Giorgino (aka Millo). Using his trademark black-and-white urban landscapes, the work is both a homage to local sculptors and a meditation on the act of retrieving beauty from raw materials, including concrete.
