Agostino Iacurci Mural | Ragusa, Sicily |  Italian-born, Berlin-based artist Agostino Iacurci is the talent behind this voluptuous, multi-storey mural. Titled Ogni bene Ã¨ mobile (Every Object is Movable), its depiction of an egg perched atop a stack of fragile objects is a meditation on the precariousness of beauty. It's also a reflection on the fragility of the region itself, its people and heritage perpetually threatened by the earth's seismic whims.
The mural is a 1.1km walk west of Ragusa's bus terminal.
