Cattedrale di San Giovanni Battista | Ragusa, Sicily |  The centrepiece of Ragusa Superiore, and a symbol of its urban renewal, is the enormous Duomo di San Giovanni Battista, built between 1718 and 1778. An elegant, terraced square fronts the ornate fa√ßade made asymmetrical by Mario Spada's pretty campanile. The latter's 129 steps can be climbed for a fetching view of the town.
