Duomo di San Giorgio | Ragusa, Sicily |  At the top end of the sloping Piazza Duomo is the town's pride and joy, the mid-18th-century cathedral with a magnificent neoclassical dome and stained-glass windows. One of Rosario Gagliardi's finest accomplishments, its extravagant convex facade rises like a three-tiered wedding cake, supported by gradually narrowing Corinthian columns and punctuated by jutting cornices.
The interior is not quite as sumptuous, although there are two paintings by Dario Guerci and a statue of St George on horseback.
