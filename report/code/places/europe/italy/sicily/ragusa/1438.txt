Pixel Pancho Mural | Ragusa, Sicily |  Just to the southwest of the train station off Via Archimede is a double portrait by Turinese artist Pixel Pancho, who is famous for exploring the dualities of the human and robotic. The presence of the oranges evokes a rural Sicilian scene from an Elio Vittorini novel. The mural is one of many around town specially created for the city's now-defunct FestiWall street-art festival.
