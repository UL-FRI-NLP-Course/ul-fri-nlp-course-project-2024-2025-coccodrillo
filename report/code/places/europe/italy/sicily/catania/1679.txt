Palazzo degli Elefanti | Catania, Sicily |  Standing at the northern end of Unesco-lauded Piazza del Duomo, the 'Palace of the Elephants' is Catania's town hall. The building's eastern, southern and western facades were designed by baroque great Giovanni Battista Vaccarini. The northern side, however, is the work of his contemporary Carmelo Battaglia.
