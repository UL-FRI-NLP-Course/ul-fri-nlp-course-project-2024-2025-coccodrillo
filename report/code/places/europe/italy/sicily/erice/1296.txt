Torre di Federico | Erice, Sicily |  Begin your Erice foray with a sweeping bird's-eye view of the medieval village from the top of this 28m-tall crenellated tower. It served as a lookout during the Sicilian Vespers uprising (1282–1314) and later became bell tower to the neighbouring cathedral.
A combined Passepartout ticket covering the tower, cathedral and two other churches in the village is available for €6.
