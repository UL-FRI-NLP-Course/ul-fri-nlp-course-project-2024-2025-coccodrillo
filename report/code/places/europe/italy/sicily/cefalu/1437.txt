Tempio di Diana | Cefal√π, Sicily |  Built of massive limestone blocks quarried directly from the mountainside, the megalithic Tempio di Diana dates back to the 4th or 5th century BC. On the same site are a sacred dolmen-type cistern dating to the 8th or 9th century BC, and the remains of a Byzantine church dedicated to St Venera. Spread across a lonely hillside, the ruins provide a romantic getaway for young lovers.
