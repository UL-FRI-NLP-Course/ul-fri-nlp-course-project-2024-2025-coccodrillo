Porta Reale | Noto, Sicily |  Whipped up by Neapolitan architect Orazio Angelini and erected in 1838, this neoclassical arch commemorates Noto's loyalty to Bourbon king Ferdinand II during an anti-monarchist revolt that broke out in Sicily in 1837. Symbolic figures adorn the arch, among them a greyhound representing loyalty to the Bourbons.
