Museo Sannitico | Molise, Italy |  Samnite ceramics found in Castello Monforte are now on show at the small Museo Sannitico, along with weapons, armour and sculptures from local archaeological sites. The Samnites were the pre-Roman nation that once controlled the area around Campobasso. Though small, the museum is well put together with highly educational signage in English and Italian.
