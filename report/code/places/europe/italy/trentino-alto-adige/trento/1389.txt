Galleria Civica di Trento | Trento, Trentino & South Tyrol |  This city gallery/project space is the Trento campus of the Museo di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto and focuses on 20th-century and contemporary art, architecture and design. The small space's seasonal program is always fascinating and tightly curated and there's an interesting little merchandise shop in the entrance.
