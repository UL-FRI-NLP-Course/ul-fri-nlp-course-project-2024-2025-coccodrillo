Giardino Botanico Alpino | Trento, Trentino & South Tyrol |  This is one of the oldest and largest gardens in the Alps; more than 2000 species of rare high-altitude plants are nurtured in this beautiful, fragile environment. Now overseen by MUSE, there is a program of talks and walks, as well as a forest playground constructed from natural elements.
