Villa Barchessa Valmarana | The Veneto, Italy |  Debuting on the riviera in the 17th century, Villa Barchessa Valmarana was commissioned by Vicenza's aristocratic Valmarana family. You'll find them enjoying la dolce vita (the sweet life) in the villa's fanciful frescoes, painstakingly restored in 1964. These days, the elegant building is mainly used as a function centre, but is still fully accessible to the public.
