Collegiata di Santa Maria Maggiore | Abruzzo, Italy |  In Guardiagrele's compact centro storico (historic centre), this striking church features a 14th-century arched portico and an austere Romanesque facade. The earliest church here is thought to have been built in the 5th century, over a temple of Apollo, but the current structure dates in its earliest parts to the 12th century.
