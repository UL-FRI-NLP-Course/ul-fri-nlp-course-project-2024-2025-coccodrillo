Citt√† della Scienza | Bay of Naples, Italy |  The interactive City of Science is part of a long-term redevelopment of the Bagnoli steelworks area, 5km southeast of central Pozzuoli. It's a particular hit with kids, who can explore everything from constellations to sea life and the human body through a series of fun, engaging exhibitions.
