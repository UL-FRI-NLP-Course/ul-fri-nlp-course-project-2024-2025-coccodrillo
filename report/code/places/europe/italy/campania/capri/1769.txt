Torre di Materita | Capri, Italy |  This rugged stone tower, halfway along the road between Anacapri and the Faro (lighthouse), was constructed in 1378 by monks of the Certosa di San Giacomo. It was once owned by Axel Munthe who resided more famously in a large villa in Anacapri. It is not currently open to the pubic.
