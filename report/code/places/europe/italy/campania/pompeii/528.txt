Casa della Venere in Conchiglia | Pompeii, Italy |  Casa della Venere in Conchiglia harbours a lovely peristyle looking onto a small, manicured garden. It's here in the garden that you'll find the large, striking Venus fresco, after which the house is named. Venus – whose hairstyle in this depiction reflects the style popular during Emperor Nero's reign – was the city's patron goddess.
