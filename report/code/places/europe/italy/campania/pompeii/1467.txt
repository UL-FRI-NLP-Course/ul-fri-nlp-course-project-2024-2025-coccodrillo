Tempio di Giove | Pompeii, Italy |  Built in the 2nd-century BC in honour of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, the Tempio di Giove was a nexus of religious activity. Its surviving elements include fluted columns and the two triumphal arches that flanked the temple. A large-scale sculpture of Jupiter's head found here can be viewed at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples.
