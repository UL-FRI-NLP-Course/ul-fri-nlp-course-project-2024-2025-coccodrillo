Anfiteatro | Pompeii, Italy |  Gladiatorial battles thrilled up to 20,000 spectators at the grassy anfiteatro. Built in 70 BC, it's the oldest known Roman amphitheatre in existence. In 59 AD, the venue witnessed violent clashes between spectators from Pompeii and Nucera, documented in a fresco now found in Naples' Museo Archeologico Nazionale.
