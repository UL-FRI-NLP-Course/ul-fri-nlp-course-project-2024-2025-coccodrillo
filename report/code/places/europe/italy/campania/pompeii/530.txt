Casa del Poeta Tragico | Pompeii, Italy |  The 1st-century AD Casa del Poeta Tragico features the world's first-known 'beware of the dog' – cave canem – warnings. Visible through a protective glass panel, the floor mosaic is one of the best preserved at the ruins. The house itself is featured in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1834 novel The Last Days of Pompeii.
