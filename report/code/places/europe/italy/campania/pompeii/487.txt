Tempio di Apollo | Pompeii, Italy |  The oldest and most important of Pompeii's religious buildings, the Tempio di Apollo largely dates from the 2nd century BC, including the striking columned portico. Fragments remain of an earlier version dating from the 6th century BC. The statues of Apollo and Diana (depicted as archers) on either side of the portico are copies; the originals are housed in Naples' Museo Archeologico Nazionale.
