Piazza Vanvitelli | Naples, Italy |  Octagonal Piazza Vanvitelli is the elegant heart of the Vomero district, its cafes and gelato vendors drawing everyone from fur-clad, cappuccino-sipping signore to Snapchatting teens out for the evening. Cutting through the piazza is Via Scarlatti, the neighbourhood's main shopping street.
