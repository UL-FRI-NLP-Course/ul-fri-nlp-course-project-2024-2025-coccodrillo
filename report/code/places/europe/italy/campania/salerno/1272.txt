Museo Virtuale della Scuola Medica Salernitana | Salerno, Italy |  In Salerno’s historic centre, this small, slightly forlorn museum deploys videos and touch-screen technology to explore the teachings and wince-inducing procedures of Salerno’s once-famous, now-defunct medical institute. Established around the 9th century, the school was the most important centre of medical knowledge in medieval Europe, reaching the height of its prestige in the 11th century. It was closed in the early 19th century.
