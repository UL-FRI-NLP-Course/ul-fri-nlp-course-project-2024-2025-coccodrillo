Snøhetta Viewpoint | Central Norway, Norway |  This arresting building of rippled timber and mirrored glass was commissioned by the Wild Reindeer Foundation as an educational centre and observation point. It offers astounding views over the valley to Mt Snøhetta. It's a gentle 1.5km walk along a gravel trail from the car park; the turn-off is signed off the E6 by Hjerkinn.
