Fiskerimuseet | The Northern Fjords, Norway |  This open-air museum, on the small island of Hjert√∏ya, is a 10-minute boat ride from Molde's Torget terminal. Its cod-liver oil factory, cottages and fishermen's shacks, tiny schoolroom and collection of boats bring to life the coastal fishing cultures around the mouth of Romsdalsfjorden from the mid-19th century onwards. The boat across to the island from Molde is included in the admission price.
