Romsdalmuseet | The Northern Fjords, Norway |  There are nearly 50 old buildings within this open-air museum, shifted here from around the Romsdal region. Among the barns, farms and storehouses, there's a short street of typical townhouses and a small reconstructed chapel with adornments rescued from abandoned churches. After rambling around the ample grounds, take a break in Bygata, a townhouse that functions as a summertime cafe. In summer, there are very worthwhile guided tours from the town centre (150kr).
