Valderøy | Ålesund, Norway |  On the island of Valderøy, the Skjonghellaren caves have revealed bones of Arctic fox, sea otter and ringed seal, plus evidence of human occupation at least 2000 years ago. In the northwest of the island, they're reached by a breezy 500m walk from the parking spot between cliff and shoreline, then a steep five-minute boulder scramble. It's about 11km by car from the centre.
