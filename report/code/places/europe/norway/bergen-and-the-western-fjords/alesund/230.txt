Giske | Ålesund, Norway |  There are two main reasons to visit Giske: its ornate 12th-century church, a lovely structure built largely of marble, and the Makkevika marshes, a prime spot for birdwatching. It's about 14km northwest of Ålesund.
In late July it's also the venue for the Sommerfesten music festival.
