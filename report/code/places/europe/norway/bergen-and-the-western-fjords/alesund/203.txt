Fishing Museum | Ã…lesund, Norway |  The 1861 Holmbua warehouse (one of the very few buildings to survive the 1904 fire) has exhibits on the development of fishing across the centuries and special sections on klippfisk (salted cod) production and the processing of cod-liver oil. Its entrance area recreates an old grocery shop, a delight in itself. Admission includes entry to the Aalesunds Museum.
