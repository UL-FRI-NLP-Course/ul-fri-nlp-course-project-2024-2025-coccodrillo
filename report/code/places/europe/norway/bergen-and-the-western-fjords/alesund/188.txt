Godøy | Ålesund, Norway |  The furthest offshore island from Ålesund, Godøy has a real off-the-map feeling, especially in the depths of winter. There are some great walks here, and the island's lighthouse at Alnes has served as an important sailors' mark for centuries. You can climb to the top for wonderful views across the island's coast.
It's about 21km from Ålesund centre.
