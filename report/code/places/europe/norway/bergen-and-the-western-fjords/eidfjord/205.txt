Skytjefossen | Bergen & the Southwestern Fjords, Norway |  Plunging almost 300m off the Hardangervidda plateau to the valley floor below, these falls, 12km north of Eidfjord in the Simadalen valley, are among the highest in Norway. To reach the trailhead, drive as far as Tveit and park just after the last house. The hike to the falls is about 3km, and takes 1Â½ hours there and back including a bit of time at the waterfall.
