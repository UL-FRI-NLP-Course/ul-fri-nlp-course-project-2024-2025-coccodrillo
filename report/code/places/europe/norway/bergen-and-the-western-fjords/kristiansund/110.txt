Gamle Byen | The Northern Fjords, Norway |  Kristiansund's old town lives on in a part of the island of Innlandet, with clapboard buildings that date back to the 17th century. The grandiose Lossiusgården, at its eastern end, was the distinguished home of an 18th-century merchant. The venerable 300-year-old Dødeladen Café still makes a lovely place for a drink or a bite to eat.The most enjoyable way of getting here is on the Sundbåten Ferry from Piren pier; otherwise it's a 15-minute walk over Heinsgata bridge.
