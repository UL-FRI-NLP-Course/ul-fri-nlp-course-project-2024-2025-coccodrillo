Mellemværftet | The Northern Fjords, Norway |  Something of a nautical junkyard, Mellemværftet, free and accessible any time, is best approached on foot along the quayside from the Smia Fiskerestaurant. It's difficult to make out what's what amid the clutter, but it includes the remnants of Kristiansund's 19th-century shipyard, a forge, workshop and workers' quarters.
