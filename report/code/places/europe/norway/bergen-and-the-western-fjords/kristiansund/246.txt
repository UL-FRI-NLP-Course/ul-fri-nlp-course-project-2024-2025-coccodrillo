Festiviteten | The Northern Fjords, Norway |  Constructed in 1914, Kristiansund's monumental theatre, although rather austere from the outside, has an attractive art nouveau interior that's definitely worth a peek for architecture and history buffs. The building is usually open during business hours. Norway's oldest opera company resides here.
