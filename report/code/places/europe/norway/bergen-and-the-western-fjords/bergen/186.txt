Bergen Kunsthall | Bergen, Norway |  Bergenâ€™s major contemporary-art institution hosts significant exhibitions of international and Norwegian artists, often with a single artist's work utilising the entire space. The cleanly glamorous 1930s architecture is worth a look in itself. The attached venue and bar, Landmark, also hosts video and electronic art, concerts, film, performances and lectures.
