Kaupanger Stave Church | The Western Fjords, Norway |  The area's most impressive sight is this stave church, raised in 1184. It impresses from within by its sheer height, although much of what you see dates from a fundamental renovation in the 17th century. Wall paintings in the nave feature musical annotation, while vine and flower motifs entwine around the chancel. The Celtic-style chancel arch is unique.
