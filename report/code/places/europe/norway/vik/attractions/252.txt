Hove Stone Church | The Western Fjords, Norway |  The region's oldest stone building, dating from the late 12th century, this church retains its original form beneath Peter Blix's elaborate makeover. This includes the abstract wall painting of nave and chancel, the wooden figures from Norse legend in the roof beams and the external gables.
