Nasjonalgalleriet | Oslo, Norway |  The gallery houses the nation's largest collection of traditional and modern art, and many of Edvard Munch's best-known creations are on permanent display, including his most renowned piece, The Scream. But there's also a clutch of works by acclaimed European artists: Gauguin, Claudel, Picasso and El Greco, plus Manet, Degas, Renoir, Matisse, CÃ©zanne and Monet are all in there. Nineteenth-century Norwegian artists have a strong showing too, including key figures such as JC Dahl and Christian Krohg.
