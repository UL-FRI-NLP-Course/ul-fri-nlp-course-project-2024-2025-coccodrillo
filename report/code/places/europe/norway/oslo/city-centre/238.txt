Queen Sonja Art Stable | Oslo, Norway |  The former palace stables, used for half a century as storage, were reopened as a public gallery space by Queen Sonja on her 80th birthday. The charming 19th-century building hosts yearly exhibitions as well as a permanent collection of fascinating photographs both by and collected by the late Queen Maud (1869â€“1938).
