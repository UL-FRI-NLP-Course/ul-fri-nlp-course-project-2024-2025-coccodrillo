Vår Frelsers | Oslo, Norway |  This triangular cemetery dates to the Napoleonic wars, but it's most notable as the final resting place of artist Munch and writer Ibsen. Ibsen's grand obelisk is marked with a hammer, while Munch's grave is graced by a bust of the artist. For Harry Hole fans, an apartment overlooking the cemetery (Ullevålsveien 15) is the site of a murder in The Devil’s Star.
