Eidsborg Stave Church | Southern Norway, Norway |  High above town on the Rv45 to HÃ¸ydalsmo, the quaint, 13th-century Eidsborg Stave Church, dedicated to St Nicolas, has but a single nave and is in particularly good shape. The grounds are open year-round, and a caretaker can usually open the church if it's locked.
