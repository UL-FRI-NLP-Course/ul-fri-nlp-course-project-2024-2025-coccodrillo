Norsk Fjellmuseum | Central Norway, Norway |  Acting as the visitor centre for Jotunheimen National Park, this worthwhile mountain museum contains mountaineering memorabilia and exhibits on natural history (the woolly mammoth is a highlight) and cultural and industrial activity in the Norwegian mountains. There's also a 10-minute mountain slide show and, upstairs, a scale model of the park.
