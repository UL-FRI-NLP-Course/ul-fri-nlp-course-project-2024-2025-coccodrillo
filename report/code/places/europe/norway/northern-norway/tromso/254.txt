M/S Polstjerna | Troms√∏, Norway |  Between 1949 and 1981, this historic seal-hunting ship killed (or 'brought home', as the literature euphemistically expresses it) nearly 100,000 seals. It's now housed under glass, and you can wander around its decks, still filled with original tools, hunting gear and sailing ephemera.
