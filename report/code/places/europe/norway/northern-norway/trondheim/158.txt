Tr√∏ndelag Senter for Samtidskunst | Trondheim, Norway |  Run by artists, this gallery space showcases all that's innovative and experimental in the local and national art scene. In the manner of modern galleries, it won't always be to everyone's taste, but it's a restless and endlessly creative exhibition space and it's worth stopping by to see what's happening on the constantly changing calendar of exhibitions. There are free guided tours at 1pm on Sundays whenever there's an exhibition on.
