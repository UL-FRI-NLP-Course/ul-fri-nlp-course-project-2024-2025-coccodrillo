Bøyabreen | The Western Fjords, Norway |  The more spectacular of the two glacial tongues accessible from Fjærland, Bøyabreen looms majestically at the end of the wooded valley. There's a car park next to the visitors centre and cafe, from where it's a short walk down to the glacial lake and an uninterrupted panorama over the glacier itself. It's a mighty hunk of ice indeed.
