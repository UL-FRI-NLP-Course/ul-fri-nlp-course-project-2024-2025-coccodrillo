Norwegian Glacier Museum | The Western Fjords, Norway |  You can't miss this striking museum: it's a concrete wedge marooned among a sea of grass on the way into Fj√¶rland, and even has a couple of model woolly mammoths outside. It provides a great overview of general glacier geology, as well as process of fjord formation, and the ecology and wildlife of Jostedalsbreen itself. Highlights are the simulated ice tunnel and the tusk of a Siberian woolly mammoth who met an icy demise 30,000 years ago.
