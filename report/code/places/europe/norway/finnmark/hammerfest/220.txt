Salen Hill | Western Finnmark, Norway |  For panoramic views over the town, coast and mountains (there's a free pair of binoculars for you to sweep the bay), climb Salen Hill (86m), topped by the Turistua restaurant, a couple of Sami turf huts and a lookout point. The 15-minute uphill walking trail begins at the small park behind the RÃ¥dhus.
