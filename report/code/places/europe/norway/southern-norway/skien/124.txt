Henrik Ibsenmuseet | Southern Norway, Norway |  Author, playwright and so-called 'Father of Modern Drama' Henrik Ibsen was born in Skien on 20 March 1828. In 1835 the family fell on hard times and moved out to the farm Venst√∏p, 5km north of Skien, where they stayed for seven years. The 1815 farmhouse has now been converted into the excellent Henrik Ibsenmuseet. There are some terrific audiovisual displays in the former barn, while guides, some of whom are Ibsen actors, show you around the family home.
