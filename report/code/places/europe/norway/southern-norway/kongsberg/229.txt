Kongsberg Kirke | Southern Norway, Norway |  Norway's largest baroque church, in the Old Town west of the river, officially opened in 1761. The rococo-style interior features ornate chandeliers and an unusual altar that combines the altarpiece, high pulpit and organ pipes on a single wall. In August there are organ recitals held here at 7pm on Wednesdays and noon on Sundays.
