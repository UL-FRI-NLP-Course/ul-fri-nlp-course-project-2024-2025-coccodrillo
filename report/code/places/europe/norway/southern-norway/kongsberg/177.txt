LÃ¥gdal Folk Museum | Southern Norway, Norway |  This folk museum, a 10-minute walk southeast of the train station, houses a collection of 32 period farmhouses around which sheep, goats and pigs frolic. Inside the main building is a WWII resistance museum and a re-creation of 19th-century and early 20th-century Kongsberg, complete with interesting descriptions of each shop and its former owner.
In summer there are guided tours on the hour from 11am to 3pm.
