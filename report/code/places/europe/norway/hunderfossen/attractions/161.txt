Norwegian Museum of Road History | Central Norway, Norway |  The Norwegian Museum of Road History tells the story of Norwayâ€™s battle to forge roads through its challenging geography. Up the hill and part of the same complex, the Fjellsprengnings-museet (Rock-Blasting Museum) is a 240m-long tunnel that gives you a real insight into the difficulties of building a tunnel through the Norwegian mountains.
The walk, guided with lighting, models and video commentary, takes around 30 minutes.
