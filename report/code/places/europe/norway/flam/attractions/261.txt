Flåmsbana Museum | The Western Fjords, Norway |  This little museum is right beside Flåm station. There's plenty to satisfy train enthusiasts here but it's not all about railways: there are also fascinating photos of construction gangs and life in and around Flåm before cars and buses made it this far up the fjords.
