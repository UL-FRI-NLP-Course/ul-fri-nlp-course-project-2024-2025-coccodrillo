Nordvegen Historiesenter | Bergen & the Southwestern Fjords, Norway |  Down a short path from the car park for St Olav's Church, this history centre recreates the story of Harald Fairhair and other monarchs of the newly unified Nordvegen from the 10th century onwards. Also nearby, on a tiny forested island is a reconstructed Viking farm â€“ it's great for kids, with staff in period dress.
