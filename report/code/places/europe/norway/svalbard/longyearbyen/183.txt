Svalbard Kirke | Longyearbyen, Norway |  The wooden Svalbard Kirke was first built in the 1920s but later rebuilt after being destroyed in the German invasion of WWII. It's a largely modern affair, although the mural behind the altar has an appealing simplicity. The church claims, with no apparent danger of contradiction, to be the world's northernmost church. It's usually left open, but services take place at 11am on Sunday and 7pm on Tuesday.
