Svalbard Museum | Longyearbyen, Norway |  Museum is the wrong word for this impressive exhibition space. Themes on display include life on the edge formerly led by whalers, trappers, seal and walrus hunters and, more recently, miners. It's an attractive mix of text, artefacts, and birds and mammals, stuffed and staring. There's a cosy book-browsing area for lounging, too, with sealskin cushions and rugs.
