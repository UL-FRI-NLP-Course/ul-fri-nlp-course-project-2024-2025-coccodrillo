Wild Photo Gallery | Longyearbyen, Norway |  This gallery of stunning Svalbard photos by Ole JÃ¸rgen Liodden and Roy Mangersnes is small but filled with utterly unforgettable images. A book that contains most of the displayed images, Svalbard Exposed, is sold here, and the two photographers run photo expeditions in Svalbard and elsewhere.
