Lofoten Gårdsysteri | Lofoten, Norway |  On the road to Saupstad, this lovely little farm has goats, pigs and chickens that the kids will enjoy. But we like it because it's a working organic farm and cheese factory. It sell its produce, including cheese, handmade sausages and honey – ideal if you're planning a picnic, such as just around the corner, past Eggum.
