Hardanger Skyspace | Bergen & the Southwestern Fjords, Norway |  US light artist James Turrell is known for his fascination with light, and has created a series of 'skyspaces' around the world, which are geometrical viewing chambers with an open roof aperture letting in the light. The Hardanger Skyspace was built beside the fjord; it's only open at sunrise and sunset, and places are limited, so bookings are required.
As the sun sets, the combination of light and colour reframed through the aperture can be quite breathtaking.
