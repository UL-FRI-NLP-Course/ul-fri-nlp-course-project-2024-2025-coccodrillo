Dili Qala | Azerbaijan, Europe |  There's nothing historic about this curious castle-like folly, an intriguing landmark on the ridge above town. It was designed to be a hotel but so poorly constructed that it was never finished. Foliage growing through the remnants adds a photogenic touch and there are great city views from here.
