Old Town Square | Azerbaijan, Europe |  Zaqatala's Old Town is centred on a pretty garden-square, above which rise two 30m tall çınar (plane trees) planted in the 1780s. To the south, there are numerous old-style house facades on the upper reaches of Heydər Əliyev pr. Follow a path past the maudlin shell of a drum-towered Orthodox church to find a minor fortress entrance.
