Balakən Mosque | Azerbaijan, Europe |  This 200-year-old mosque is easily spotted thanks to its tapering octagonal minaret, freestanding with red-brick patterned facets. The mosque itself is a multi-pillared stone hall containing a particularly notable carved minbar (Islamic pulpit).
From the ABB bank walk 250m southwest down Səmmədov küç and turn left: the mosque entrance is opposite the ultra-basic Hotel Balakən.
