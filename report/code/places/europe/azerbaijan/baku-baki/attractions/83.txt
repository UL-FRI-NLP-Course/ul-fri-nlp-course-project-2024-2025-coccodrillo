Təzə Pir Mosque | Baku, Azerbaijan |  The grandest historic mosque in central Baku, Təzə Pir was built between 1903 and 1914, funded by a female philanthropist. More-recent renovations added gilding to its minaret tips and stone cladding to the surrounding buildings, which house the Centre for Islam in the Caucasus.
The website offers virtual 360-degree tours of this and two other associated Baku mosques.
