Ali Şamsi’s Studio | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Shoes walk across this gallery's fascinatingly off-beat front wall, whose centrepiece is a huge lion's face. Inside are paint splattered shirts and a collection of skulls. The result is an intriguing little studio that's well worth a look even if you don't end up buying any of Ali's bold pomegranate-themed canvasses.
