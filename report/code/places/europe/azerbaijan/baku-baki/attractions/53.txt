Medieval Market Square | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Directly in front of the Maiden's Tower are assorted archaeological diggings at what some consider to be the site where Jesus' disciple St Bartholomew was martyred. Set back is a small, former market-square area now used as an open-air exhibition for a selection of historic stones.
Technically you're supposed to have a Maiden's Tower ticket to enter but it's entirely effortless to look down onto the site from the surrounding walkways or a little teahouse that rings its northern rim.
