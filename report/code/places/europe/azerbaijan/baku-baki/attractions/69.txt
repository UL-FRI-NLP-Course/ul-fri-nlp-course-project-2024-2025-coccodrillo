Caspian Waterfront Mall | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Designed like an eight-petalled flower but five stories high and made of steel and glass, this giant project has been under construction since 2007 and was originally conceived as a congress centre. In fact, when it finally opens (estimated for 2020) it is likely to be a shopping mall and entertainment centre.
Original architectural designs posted online lead many sci-fi fans to dub the project the 'Death Star', but the final version is far softer.
