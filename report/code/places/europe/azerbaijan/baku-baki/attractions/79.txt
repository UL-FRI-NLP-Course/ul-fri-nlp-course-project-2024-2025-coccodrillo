Museum of Miniature Books | Baku, Azerbaijan |  One of Baku's charming oddities, this small museum presents books that are so small you'd need a magnifying glass to read the print. The fact that so many minuscule publications have been printed at all is a surprise, and amassing the thousands shown here has been a lifetime's passion for collector Zərifə Salahova who started the place in 2002.
It's well worth five minutes if you're passing.
