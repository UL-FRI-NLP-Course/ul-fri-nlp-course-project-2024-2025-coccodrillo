ArtÄ±m | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Changing exhibitions are necessarily a little hit-and-miss at this experimental art space, which gives a platform to young or emerging new Azerbaijani artists. Don't miss sneaking up to the top floor to snap a perfectly framed photo of the Shirvanshahs' palace.
The rooftop is sometimes used as a 'yoga garden'.
