Grand Synagogue | Azerbaijan, Europe |  The most impressive of Qırmızı Qəsəbə's surviving synagogues is a two-storey brick structure dating from 1888, pimpled with six spired minidomes.
It opens irregularly, mostly for special ceremonies. If closed, there is a second, more regularly active synagogue around 200m northeast that welcomes visitors. Remove shoes before entry.
