Nizami Park | Azerbaijan, Europe |  Old chaps in flat caps sip tea and slap dominoes all day long beneath shady chestnut and plane trees on this attractive, tree-shaded square. There's an ornamental 'castle' tower, a museum, a metal spired turbe (tomb-tower) and statues of poets, peasants and sportswomen. The latter give the stairway down to the Qırmızı Qəsəbə pedestrian bridge a nostalgic sense of Soviet optimism.
