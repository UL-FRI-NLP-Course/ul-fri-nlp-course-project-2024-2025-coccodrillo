Cümə Məscid | Azerbaijan, Europe |  This octagonal mosque is Quba’s most-distinctive historic building. Painted a dull red and topped with a metallic dome forming a central point like a Prussian helmet, it looks particularly photogenic viewed from the Meydan, framed between trees.
Visitors can enter, but the interior is less memorable.
