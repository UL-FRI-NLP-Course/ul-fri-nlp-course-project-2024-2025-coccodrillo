Ordubad | Azerbaijan, Europe |  Naxçivan's most attractive settlement appears like an oasis amid craggy desert landscapes. Its central square features a classic old-men's teahouse beneath giant çinar (plane) trees and its narrow streets hide many an older building behind mud-brick walls. There are a couple of small museums to seek out, one of them opposite a distinctive brick mosque in a former zorkhana (venue for a distinctive Persian strength-meditation martial art).
From Naxçivan City, several daily minibuses run to Ordubad (AZN2, 90 minutes), with the last return around 4pm from a bus station around 400m south of the central area.Alternatively, consider paying a taxi or travel agency to make the visit part of a day-return trip that could also include Alinja Castle and Əshabi-Kəhf.
