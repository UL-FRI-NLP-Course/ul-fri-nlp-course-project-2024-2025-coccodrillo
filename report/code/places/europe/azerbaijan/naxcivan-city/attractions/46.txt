Naxçivanqala | Azerbaijan, Europe |  Before 2006, the site of Naxçivan's 7th-century citadel was just a series of muddy undulations, almost indistinguishable from the nearby graveyard. It has since been 'reconstructed' as a large square 'fortress', surrounded by crenellated walls which look better suited to a funfair than a historical site. Still, they provide many fine viewpoints and the circular building in the middle displays some fascinating archaeological discoveries.
There's a gigantic new mosque behind the southeast wall along with Noah's Tomb.
