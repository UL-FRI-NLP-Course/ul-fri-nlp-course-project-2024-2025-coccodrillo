Viewpoint | Azerbaijan, Europe |  In and around Lerik there are numerous points from which to savour wide panoramas over highland fields and serrated crags. One relatively central option can be found by climbing the long stairway behind Flag Sq onto the main suburban ridge. For still wider views, hike/drive up to the TV tower across the valley.
