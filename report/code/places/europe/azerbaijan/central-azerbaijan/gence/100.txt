Heydar Əliyev Park | Azerbaijan, Europe |  In the unofficial 'Top Park' competition between Azerbaijani cities, Gəncə's vast Heydar Əliyev Park wins hands down. Along with a fairground, modern-art museum, culture centre and amphitheatre for occasional free concerts, there's what looks like a full-sized Arc de Triomphe.
It's off Rte 50 at the western edge of town.
