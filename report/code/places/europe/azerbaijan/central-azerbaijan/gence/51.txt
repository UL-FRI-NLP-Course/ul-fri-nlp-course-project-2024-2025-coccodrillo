Lake Göy Göl | Azerbaijan, Europe |  South of Göygöl are numerous woodland restaurants, then after Hacikənd the road emerges onto a ridge with magnificent views of the Lesser Caucasus range, crowned by the beaklike peak of Mt Kyapaz (Kəpəz Dağı). Further still, edged with forests and a few hotels, lies the much vaunted lake for which Göygöl is named. Higher, arguably more beautiful, and much less developed is Lake Maral Göl, 7km beyond.
A chartered taxi from Göygöl visiting all of the above costs from around AZN30 return. Allow at least three hours.
