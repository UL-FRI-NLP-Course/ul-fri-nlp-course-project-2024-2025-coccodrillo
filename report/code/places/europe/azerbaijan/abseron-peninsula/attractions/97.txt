Ramana Fortress | Azerbaijan, Europe |  On a rocky outcrop at Ramana, this fortress tower is one of the Ab≈üeron's most dramatic castles, but adding to the interest of the visit is the view of many grungy old oil workings, nodding donkeys and run-off pools that it surveys.
Finding the key-holder is hit-and-miss (good luck!). A donation is appropriate if you are let inside.
