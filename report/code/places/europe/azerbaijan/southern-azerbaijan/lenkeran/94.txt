Imam Ali MÉ™scidi | Azerbaijan, Europe |  Dating from 1876, this tile-roofed brick mosque is archetypal of the region with its coloured-glass windows set within large pointed arches. Its pair of slightly off-line buildings form two sides of a peaceful open courtyard, just south of the contrastingly frenetic bazaar.
It's a place of active worship but sensitive visitors are welcome.
