Folk & Costume Museum | Guernsey, The Channel Islands |  In the middle of the vast, landscaped Sausmarez Park, this excellent museum is an enjoyable romp through Guernsey life a hundred years ago. Walk through a reconstructed parlour, kitchen and schoolroom, check out the toys meant to prepare early 20th-century Guernsey kids for the toils of adulthood and marvel at the intricate dolls' houses. There's also a fashion section for those wanting to party like it's 1928, displays on the famous Guernsey tomatoes and barns full of farming equipment.
