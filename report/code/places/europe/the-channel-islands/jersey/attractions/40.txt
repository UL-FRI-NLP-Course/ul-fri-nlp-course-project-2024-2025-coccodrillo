aMaizin! Adventure Park | Jersey, The Channel Islands |  You know when you were a kid, and you wished there were one place where you could go go-karting, ride a tractor, go down a giant slide, go tobogganing, pet farm animals, go crazy golfingâ€¦Well, it might be too late for you, but you can certainly bring your own kids to this farm adventure park, popular year-round. Come between July and September if you want to get lost in the maize maze, though.
