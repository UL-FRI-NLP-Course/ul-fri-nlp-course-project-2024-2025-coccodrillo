Window in the Rock | The Channel Islands, Europe |  Branching off the main road just north of the Seigneurie Gardens, a 15-minute walk leads you to particularly scenic spot on the west coast: a square hole cut in the cliff face with a sheer drop and epic cliff views on the other side. Backtrack for a couple of minutes, and you can take the stone steps down to the beautiful Port du Moulin beach with clear blue waters.
