Sark Occupation & Heritage Museum | The Channel Islands, Europe |  Housed inside a centuries-old cottage, this excellent little museum sheds light on the harrowing experience of the islanders under Nazi occupation, as well as Operation Basalt â€“ the 1942 British raid on Sark that resulted in several German deaths and led to the deportation of Channel Islanders to Germany in retaliation. A more light-hearted display deals with the quirks of Sarkese life, including a one-man invasion of the island in 1990 by an unemployed nuclear physicist from France.
