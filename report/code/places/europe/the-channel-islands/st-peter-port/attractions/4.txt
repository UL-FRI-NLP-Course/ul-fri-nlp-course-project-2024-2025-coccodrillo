Guernsey Museum & Art Gallery | Guernsey, The Channel Islands |  This museum is an enjoyable stampede through the millennia-old history of Guernsey: home to Neolithic farmers, strategic Roman port, Norman stronghold, refuge of privateers, and, finally a sun-drenched tax haven. Delve into the Guernsey witch trials, learn about the nightmarish creatures from the island's mythology, peek at a 15th-century grimoire, and find out why a mummified cat was found beneath one of the local hotels. In the art gallery, the nautical landscapes are particularly engaging.
Don't miss the special exhibitions; past ones have included an in-depth look at front-line medicine during WWI, and Reflections on the Occupation: poems, sculpture, paintings and installations inspired by the island's experience under the Nazis.
