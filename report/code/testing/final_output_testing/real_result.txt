Mais à combien s’élève réellement la rémunération dans ce secteur souvent perçu comme stable, mais peu valorisé ? Voici ce que révèlent les dernières données sur le sujet. Les agents de sécurité sont des maillons essentiels dans la chaîne de protection des biens et des personnes. Pourtant, leur rémunération reste souvent sujette à débat. Combien gagnent-ils réellement\xa0? L’expérience change-t-elle la donne\xa0? La ville dans laquelle on exerce influence-t-elle le salaire\xa0? Et que dire des primes et compléments\xa0? Autant de questions auxquelles nous apporterons des éléments de réponses à travers cet article en nous appuyant uniquement sur les données issues des plateformes de référence les plus consultées par les professionnels. L’agent de sécurité perçoit en moyenne entre 1\xa0628\xa0€ et 1\xa0897\xa0€ nets par mois selon les estimations. Si les débuts de carrière tournent autour de 1\xa0763\xa0€, les profils les plus expérimentés peuvent atteindre jusqu’à 2\xa0200\xa0€ mensuels. Une rémunération qui varie selon les plateformes, l’expérience et la localisation géographique. En effet, les estimations du salaire moyen d’un agent de sécurité varient légèrement selon les sources, mais dessinent un paysage globalement cohérent. La rémunération mensuelle moyenne se situe entre 1\xa0628\xa0€ et 1\xa0897\xa0€ nets par mois : Ces écarts s’expliquent par les méthodes de calcul différentes et les profils représentés dans les bases de données. Il en ressort néanmoins une tendance claire, le salaire d’un agent de sécurité est en général inférieur à 2\xa0000\xa0€ nets mensuels, sauf dans certains cas particuliers ou dans des localisations précises. Contrairement à d’autres professions, l’expérience a peu d’impact sur le salaire dans le secteur de la sécurité. En effet, les différentes plateformes indiquent des fourchettes quasi identiques pour les profils débutants, intermédiaires et expérimentés\xa0: Cette faible progression salariale met en évidence un plafond de verre assez bas pour les agents de sécurité, où l’ancienneté n’est pas forcément récompensée à sa juste valeur en termes de rémunération. L’un des facteurs les plus influents sur le salaire est la localisation géographique. En effet, selon Indeed, les écarts entre villes peuvent atteindre près de 600\xa0€\xa0: Ces écarts s’expliquent par plusieurs facteurs\xa0: le coût de la vie local, les besoins de sécurité accrus dans certaines zones, ou encore les contrats spécifiques passés entre entreprises et agents. Il est donc essentiel de prendre en compte la région d’exercice pour évaluer correctement la rémunération d’un poste. Oui, des rémunérations supplémentaires peuvent s’ajouter au salaire de base. Ces compléments incluent\xa0: Sur Glassdoor, cette part complémentaire est estimée à 108\xa0€ par mois en moyenne, avec une fourchette allant de 35\xa0€ à 688\xa0€. Cela peut représenter un apport significatif pour certains profils, surtout dans les structures où les dispositifs de primes sont bien établis. Toutefois, ces rémunérations supplémentaires sont très variables d’un contrat à l’autre, et ne peuvent être considérées comme acquises dans tous les cas. Elles dépendent largement des conditions de travail, des horaires, des clients et de la structure employeuse. Ça peut aussi vous intéresser\xa0: 2024\xa0: Combien touche un agent d'EHPAD\xa0?

The origins of this iconic Neapolitan dish can be traced to the early 1700s, when what we know today as pizza marinara was first described by Italian chef, writer, and philosopher Vincenzo Corrado in his treatise on the eating habits of the people of Naples.Almost 200 years later, in 1889, the premier Neapolitan master pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito added mozzarella to the mix and invented the margherita, which is now generally cited as the first modern pizza. Originally dubbedla pizza tricolore, Esposito’s creation is said to have been made in honor of and named after Margherita of Savoy, the Queen consort of the Kingdom of Italy, who was visiting Naples at the time.In 2010, as one of Italy’s most popular foods worldwide, pizza Napoletana was officially recognized by the European Union and granted the designation of Traditional Specialty Guaranteed.

Some believe that struffoli bring good luck, and that the tiny rounds symbolize abundance and prosperity.

The Queen loved the dish, and Esposito named it after her - pizza Margherita, but such a pizza was also made before that time, and can be dated back to at least 1866, when the most popular pizza toppings included basil, cheese, and tomatoes, but the pizza was not yet named Margherita.Since those times, Margherita has become one of the most popular pizza varieties in the world, and in 2009, it was protected as one of the threePizze Napoletanewith an STG European label of protection, proving its excellence in flavor, ingredients, and traditional pizza-making techniques.'}, {'name': 'Sugo alla puttanesca', 'location': 'Naples', 'review': 4.3, 'food_type': 'Sauces', 'description': 'Sugo alla puttanesca is a robust Italian sauce typically\xa0made with kalamata olives, capers, anchovies, tomatoes, and crushed red pepper flakes.
