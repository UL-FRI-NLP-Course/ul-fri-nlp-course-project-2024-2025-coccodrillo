National Library | Pristina, Kosovo |  Easily one of Pristina's most notable buildings, the National Library, completed in 1982 by Croatian Andrija Mutnjakovic, has to be seen to be believed (think gelatinous eggs wearing armour). It's in the centre of a pleasant green area, one of the few things approaching a public park in the centre of Pristina.
