Mirusha Waterfalls | Kosovo, Europe |  These small but pretty double waterfalls cascade over the rocks into a deep pool that's perfect for swimming in. And in summer plenty of locals do! The falls, which are about halfway between Pristina and Peja, are an enjoyable half-hour walk through farming countryside and are well signposted from the village of Gremnik.
