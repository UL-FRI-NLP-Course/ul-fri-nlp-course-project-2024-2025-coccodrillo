Castle Museum | Esztergom, Hungary |  The Castle Museum is housed in the former Royal Palace, built mostly by French architects in the 12th century during Esztergomâ€™s golden age. The palace was largely destroyed by the Turks; today the structure is a combination of modern brickwork and medieval stone masonry. Highlights among the 20-odd rooms are the Royal Chapel and its 13th-century frescoes, St Stephen's Room (where the good king was supposedly born), the White Tower and views from it, and the Gerevich Rooms displaying castle foundations through the ages.
