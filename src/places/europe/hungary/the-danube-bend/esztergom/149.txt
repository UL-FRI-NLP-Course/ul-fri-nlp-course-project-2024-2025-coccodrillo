Öziçeli Hacci Ibrahim Mosque | Esztergom, Hungary |  This 400-year-old mosque was built in the 17th century, during the Ottoman occupation of Esztergom. In its later incarnations it served both as a granary and as a residence before becoming a museum that showcases its remarkable history. The mihrab (prayer niche facing Mecca) is largely intact, and it is the only two-storey mosque in the whole of Hungary. Out back is a waterwheel; there was a well here during the Ottoman siege of Esztergom. Without water, the Hungarians surrendered.
There's an appealing cafe downstairs, too.
