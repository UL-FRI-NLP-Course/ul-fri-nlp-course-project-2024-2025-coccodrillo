Török Bank House | Budapest, Hungary |  Designed by Henrik Böhm and Ármin Hegedűs in 1906, 'Turkish Bank' House is worth a look. It has an almost totally glass-covered facade, and in the upper gable it sports a wonderful Secessionist mosaic by Miksa Róth called Patrona Hungariae, which depicts Hungary surrounded by great Hungarians of the past.
