Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art | Budapest, Hungary |  Housed in the architecturally controversial Palace of Arts just north of Rákóczi Bridge, the Ludwig Museum holds Hungary’s most important collection of international contemporary art. Works by Hungarian, American, Russian, German and French artists span the past half-century, while works by Central and Eastern European artists date mostly from the 1990s. The museum's temporary exhibitions are invariably well received.
