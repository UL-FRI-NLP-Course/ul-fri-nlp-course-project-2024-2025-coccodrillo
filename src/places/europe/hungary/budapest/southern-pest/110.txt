Corvin Cinema | Budapest, Hungary |  A restored art deco building, the Corvin sits in the middle of a square flanked by Regency-like houses. Note the two wonderful reliefs outside the main entrance to the cinema and the monument to the Pesti sr√°cok, the heroic 'kids from Pest' who fought and died in the neighbourhood during the 1956 Uprising.
