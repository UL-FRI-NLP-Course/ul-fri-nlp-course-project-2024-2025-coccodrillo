Óbuda Synagogue | Óbuda & Buda Hills, Budapest |  Next to the landmark Aquincum Hotel Budapest, the Óbuda Synagogue was built in 1821. For many years it housed Hungarian TV (MTV) sound studios because the much-reduced post-WWII Jewish population couldn't afford the upkeep, but it is now at long last functioning as a súl (Jewish prayer house) with daily workshops and/or services.
