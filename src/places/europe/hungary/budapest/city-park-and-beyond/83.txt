Miksa Róth Memorial House | Budapest, Hungary |  This fabulous museum exhibits the work of the eponymous art nouveau stained-glass maker Róth (1865–1944) over two floors of the house and workshop where he lived and worked from 1911 until his death. Róth’s dark-brown living quarters stand in sharp contrast to the lively, Technicolor creations that emerged from his studio. His stunning mosaics are less well known but equal to his stained glass.
