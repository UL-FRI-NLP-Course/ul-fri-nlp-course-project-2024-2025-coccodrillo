Tropicarium | Budapest, Hungary |  The vast aquarium complex called Tropicarium is apparently the largest in Central Europe. The place prides itself on its local specimens – though there’s an 11m-long 'shark zoo' (cápás állatkert) containing all manner of beasties. Shark-feeding time is between 3pm and 4pm on Thursday.
