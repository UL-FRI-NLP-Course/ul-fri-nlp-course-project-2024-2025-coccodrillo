Franciscan Church & Monastery | Budapest, Hungary |  These ruins – no more than a tower and a wall dating back to the late 13th century – are in the centre of the island. Habsburg Archduke Joseph built a summer residence here when he inherited the island in 1867. It was later converted into a hotel, which operated until 1949.
