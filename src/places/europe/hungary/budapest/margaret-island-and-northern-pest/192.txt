Musical Fountain | Budapest, Hungary |  One of the highlights during the warmer months on Margaret Island is this musical fountain, which dances and sprays and pulsates to music on the hour through the day, starting at 10am and carrying on till 10pm with everything from children's ditties and classical music pieces to Ed Sheeran's 'Shape of You'.
