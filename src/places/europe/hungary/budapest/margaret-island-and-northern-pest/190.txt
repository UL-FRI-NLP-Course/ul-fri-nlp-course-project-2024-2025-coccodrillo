Hungarian Railway History Park | Budapest, Hungary |  This mostly outdoor museum contains more than 50 locomotives (a dozen of them still working) and an exhibition on the history of the railway in Hungary. There’s a wonderful array of hands-on activities – mostly involving getting behind the wheel – for kids. Riding the miniature locomotive is a real treat.
