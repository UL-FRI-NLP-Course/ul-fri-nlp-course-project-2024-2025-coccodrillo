Pinball Museum | Budapest, Hungary |  This quirky museum housed in a basement is one of Budapest's hidden attractions. It’s home to 140 vintage pinball museums – yes, you can play all but the oldest wooden models dating back as far as 1947. As the largest such collection in Europe that's not only accessible to the public but also interactive, it has quite a cult following and is always busy.
