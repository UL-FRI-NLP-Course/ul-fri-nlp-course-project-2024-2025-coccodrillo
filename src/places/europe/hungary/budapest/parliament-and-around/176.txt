In Memoriam: 1956 Revolution Memorial | Budapest, Hungary |  The poignant underground In Memoriam: 1956 Revolution examines the events of `Bloody Thursday', 25 October 1956, when soldiers opened fire on a peaceful crowd on the square here, killing hundreds of people. Follow the red neon line on the floor, suggesting a river of blood, past videos, photos and memorabilia of the period. The hologram of a tank opening fire is frightening.
