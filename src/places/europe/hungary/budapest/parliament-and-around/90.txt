Bedő House (House of Hungarian Art Nouveau) | Budapest, Hungary |  Just around the corner from Kossuth Lajos tér, the stunning art nouveau Bedő-ház apartment block was designed by Emil Vidor in 1903. It is now a shrine to Hungarian Secessionist interiors, its three levels crammed with furniture, porcelain, ironwork, paintings and objets d’art. The lovely Szecesszió Cafe is on the ground floor.
