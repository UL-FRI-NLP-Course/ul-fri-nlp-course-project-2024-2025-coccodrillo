Ábrahám Ganz Foundry Museum | Castle District, Budapest |  This museum – a lot more interesting than it sounds – is housed in the Ganz Machine Works foundry, which was in use until the 1960s manufacturing the 'world-famous' (their word, not ours) chill-cast railway wheel. The massive ladles and cranes still stand, anxiously awaiting employment. Alas, time and progress have frozen them still. The exhibits also include cast-iron stoves, bells and street furniture.
