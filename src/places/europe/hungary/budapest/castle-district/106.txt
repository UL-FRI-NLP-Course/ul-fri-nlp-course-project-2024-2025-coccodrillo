Eugene of Savoy Statue | Castle District, Budapest |  To the southeast of the Habsburg Steps entrance, just in front of the Royal Palace, stands a statue of Eugene of Savoy, the Habsburg prince who wiped out the last Turkish army in Hungary at the Battle of Zenta in Serbia in 1697. Designed by József Róna 200 years later, it is considered to be the finest equestrian statue in Budapest.
