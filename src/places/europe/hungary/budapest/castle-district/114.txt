Vienna Gate | Castle District, Budapest |  This medieval entrance to the Old Town was rebuilt in 1936 to mark the 250th anniversary of the castle being taken back from the Turks. The gate is not all that huge, but when Budapest children are loquacious or noisy, their parents tell them: 'Your mouth is as big as the Vienna Gate!'
