Golden Eagle Pharmacy Museum | Castle District, Budapest |  Just north of Dísz tér, on the site of Budapest’s first pharmacy (1681), this small, entertaining museum contains a mock-up of an alchemist’s laboratory, with dried bats and stuffed crocodiles suspended from the ceiling, a small ‘spice rack’ used by 17th-century travellers for their daily fixes of curative herbs, curiously shaped glassware and a blackened mummy head.
