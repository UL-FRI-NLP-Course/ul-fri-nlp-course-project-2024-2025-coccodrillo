Turul Statue | Castle District, Budapest |  To the east of the Habsburg Steps entrance to the palace is a bronze statue from 1905 of the Turul, a hawklike totemic bird that supposedly impregnated Emese, grandmother of Árpád, the chief military commander who led the Magyar tribes into the Carpathian Basin in about AD 895. Blame it on the bird.
