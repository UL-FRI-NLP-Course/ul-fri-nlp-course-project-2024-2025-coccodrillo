Music History Museum | Castle District, Budapest |  Housed in an 18th-century palace with a lovely courtyard, this wonderful little museum traces the development of music in Hungary from the 18th century to the present day in eight exhibition rooms. There are rooms devoted to the work of Béla Bartók, Franz Liszt, Zoltán Kodály and Joseph Haydn, with lots of instruments and original scores and manuscripts. Lovely place to spend an hour or two.
