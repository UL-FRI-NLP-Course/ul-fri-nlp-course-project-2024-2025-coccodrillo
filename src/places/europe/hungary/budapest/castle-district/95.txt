Former Capuchin Church | Castle District, Budapest |  Used as a mosque during the Turkish occupation, this church recycled Islamic-style, ogee-arched doors and windows on the southern side when it was rebuilt in the 18th century. Around the corner there's the seal of King Matthias Corvinus – a raven and a ring – and little Corvin tér with the delightful Louis Fountain (Lajos kútja, 1904).
