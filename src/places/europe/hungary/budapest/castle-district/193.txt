Sándor Palace | Castle District, Budapest |  This imposing neoclassical palace dates back to 1806 and now serves as the official residence of Hungary's president (János Áder who was re-elected to a second five-year term in 2017). You can watch the relatively low-key changing of the guard in front of the palace every hour on the hour from 9am to 5pm.
