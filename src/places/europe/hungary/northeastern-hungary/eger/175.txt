Eger Basilica | Eger, Hungary |  A highlight of the town’s amazing architecture is Eger Basilica. This neoclassical monolith was designed in 1836 by József Hild, the same architect who later worked on the cathedral at Esztergom on the Danube Bend. The half-hour organ concert is a good time to visit, when the ornate altars and soaring dome create interesting acoustics.
