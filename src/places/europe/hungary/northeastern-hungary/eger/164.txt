Lyceum | Eger, Hungary |  Directly east of Eger Basilica is the Zopf-style Lyceum (1765), now headquarters of the Károly Eszterházy University of Applied Sciences. It contains a priceless historical library on the 1st floor of the south wing. Above that and spread over several floors is the so-called Magic Tower, a 'popular science centre' that will surprise and delight both adults and children.
