Pont de Claies | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Installed every summer, Pont de Claies is Belgium's last seasonal footbridge. Originally designed to let tobacco harvesters reach their crops, it's made by placing hazel-weave onto log stilts embedded in the river. The bridge site is 500m down an unpaved track from the church in Laf√¥ret.
