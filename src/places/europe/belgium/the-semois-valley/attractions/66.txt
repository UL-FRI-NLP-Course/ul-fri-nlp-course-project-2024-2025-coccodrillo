Rochehaut | The Ardennes, Belgium |  The scenery west of Bouillon reaches a memorable climax at Rochehaut, where a long balcony surveys a glorious view down across a perfect river curl enfolded in deep green forests. On the pastoral peninsula deep below is the attractive little hamlet of Frahan-sur-Semois, accessed by a steep footpath and pedestrian bridge.
