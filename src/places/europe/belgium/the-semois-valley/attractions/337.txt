Centre d'Interprétation d'Art | The Ardennes, Belgium |  In the centre of Vresse, this attractive gallery has a 300-work permanent collection featuring paintings and sculpture by artists with local connections. Most celebrated among these is Albert Raty (1889–1970), for whom Vresse's main street is named, but don't miss the semi-cubist works of Milo Dardenne as well.
There's also a free annually changing temporary exhibition.
