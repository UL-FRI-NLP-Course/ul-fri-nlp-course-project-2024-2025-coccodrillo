PAM | Northwest Belgium, Belgium |  This museum of archaeology and local history occupies a site that in AD 925 was one of three main defences along the border between pre-medieval France and Ottonian Germany. It later became a vast abbey that was destroyed in the French Revolution. That history is brought to life here with dioramas, video material and multilingual audioguides.The museum is in a quiet back street in Ename village, on the outskirts of Oudenaarde, adjacent to a 1000-year-old stone church.
A network of walking trails take the inquisitive visitor on a journey over the land where these stories played out.
