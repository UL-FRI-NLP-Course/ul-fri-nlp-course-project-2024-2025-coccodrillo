Stadhuis | Northwest Belgium, Belgium |  Oudenaardeâ€™s impressive market square is dominated by this gorgeous town hall, built in the secular Brabantine Gothic style. The building houses the MOU and tourist information office. Its perfectly boxy shape, steep slanted roof, gables, countless castle-like turrets and central crown-topped belfry spire make it an excellent photographic subject.
