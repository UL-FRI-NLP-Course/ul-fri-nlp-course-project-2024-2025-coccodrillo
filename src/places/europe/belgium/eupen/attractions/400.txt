Pfarrkirche Sankt Nikolaus | The Ardennes, Belgium |  The 1726 church of St Nicholas is Eupen's visual centrepiece, thanks to iconic twin spires with copper cladding that were added in an 1898 makeover. The interior has a classic baroque feel with a lavish multifaceted altarpiece and crown-topped pulpit.
