Palais Stoclet | Belgium, Europe |  The radically geometric exterior of the 1911 Palais Stoclet is an early premonition of art deco: the architect was instructed to produce a Gesamtkunstwerk (‘total work of art’). The building is closed to the public, but its dazzling interiors feature work by Klimt and Khnopff.
