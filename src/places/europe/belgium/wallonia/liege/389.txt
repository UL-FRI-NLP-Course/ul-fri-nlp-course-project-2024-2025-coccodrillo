Musée d’Ansembourg | Liège, Belgium |  Less a museum than a magnificently furnished 1755 Regency mansion with original stucco ceilings and some gilded leather ‘wallpaper’. Its highlights include four original 17th-century Oudenaarde tapestries. You could easily see all 18 rooms in around 20 minutes.
