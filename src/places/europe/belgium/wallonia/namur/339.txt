Cathédrale St-Aubain | Namur, Belgium |  This vast Italianate neoclassical cathedral, finished in 1767, has an undeniably impressive exterior but a rather remote, mausoleum-like off-white interior.
Among the 17th-century paintings on display are The Visitation, the Last Supper and the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple – all works by Jacques Nicolaï, a follower of Rubens.
