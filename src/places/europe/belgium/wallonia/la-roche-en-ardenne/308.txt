Parc à Gibier | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Parc à Gibier is typical of several Ardennes animal parks that are designed to introduce children to local wildlife, notably deer, wolves and wild boars. It's around 2km northeast of La Roche.
On foot you could get here along the path that starts up to tiny St-Marguerite Chapel above La Roche's castle. From November to March the park only opens on Wednesday afternoons or on weekends during school holidays.
