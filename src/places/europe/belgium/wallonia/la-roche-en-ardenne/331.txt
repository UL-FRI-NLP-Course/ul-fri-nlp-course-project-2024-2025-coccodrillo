Musée de la Bataille des Ardennes | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Waxwork scenes, maps and the odd video provide a competent, if unsophisticated, explanation of La Roche’s involvement in the wintry WWII Battle of the Bulge, when 114 villagers perished and 90% of La Roche’s buildings were flattened.
The personal remembrances of local women are especially poignant.
