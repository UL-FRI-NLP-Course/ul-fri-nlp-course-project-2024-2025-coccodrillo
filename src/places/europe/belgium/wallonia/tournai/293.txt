Beffroi | Wallonia, Belgium |  Belgiumâ€™s oldest belfry is 72m high with a narrow 257-step spiral staircase that becomes even narrower higher up. There's a good multilingual display on the history and significance of belfries as symbols of civic liberties partway up, but otherwise the main attractions are the bells and the views, described by faded signboards. Ask at the tourist office about bell concerts, during which you can climb the tower to see the ringer at work.
