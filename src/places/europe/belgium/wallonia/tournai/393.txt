Mus√©e de Folklore | Wallonia, Belgium |  This is a lovable and sizeable warren of fascinating city-relevant relics and ethnographic artefacts. It's all in French, but many of the cameo scenes are self-explanatory, and across the 'bridge-room' there's a great model of Tournai in its 18th-century heyday.
