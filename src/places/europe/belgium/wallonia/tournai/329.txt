Pont des Trous | Wallonia, Belgium |  Dating from the 13th century, this photogenic fortified bridge defended the city and was also used for toll collections. Partially destroyed in WWII, it was rebuilt with the central arch larger to allow modern barges through. It is likely to be further modified at some point to let still larger river traffic pass, but it remains an intriguing reminder of Belgian defensive architecture.
