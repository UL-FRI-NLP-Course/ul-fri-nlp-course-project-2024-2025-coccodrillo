Halle Aux Draps | Wallonia, Belgium |  Tournai's former cloth hall is the Grand Place's finest building, with an elegant gilt-detailed facade and a brick-vaulted interior that opens for occasional exhibitions. The current Renaissance facade dates from the 17th century â€“ though it was painstakingly rebuilt following the building's collapse in 1881.
