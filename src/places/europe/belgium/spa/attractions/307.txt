Spa Monopole | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Selling the waters of Spa remains big buiness, with millions of bottles filled annually at this industrial-scale plant. A self-guided visit to the production facility includes views down on the bottling lines and tablet-led games for school kids, but information is only in French and Dutch.
Though the plant is just across the tracks from Spa's train station there is no bridge so access requires a 900m detour.
