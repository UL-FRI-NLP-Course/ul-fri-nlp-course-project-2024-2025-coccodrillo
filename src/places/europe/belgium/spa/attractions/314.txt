Pouhon Pierre-le-Grand | The Ardennes, Belgium |  The restored, octagonal-fronted stone building hosting the tourist office was the site of Spa’s original springs. It was renamed for Russian tsar Peter the Great, whose visit to Spa in 1717 helped popularise the resort. Buy a jetton for €1 to taste the waters from modernist fountain taps or pay €8 to enter a rich if somewhat spurious exhibition of Joan Miró lithographs in an attractive old hall.
