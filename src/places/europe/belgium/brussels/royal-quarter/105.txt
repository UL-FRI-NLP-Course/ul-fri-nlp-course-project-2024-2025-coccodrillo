Musée BELvue | Brussels, Belgium |  Take a chronological audio tour through the airy stuccoed interior of this former royal residence to explore Belgium’s history from independence to today, brought to life by exhibits and film footage. Among the artefacts is the jacket worn by Albert I when he died in a climbing accident in 1934. In summer, the restaurant has tables in the pretty garden.
