Église Notre-Dame de la Chapelle | Brussels, Belgium |  Brussels’ oldest surviving church now curiously incorporates the decapitated tower of the 1134 original as the central section of a bigger Gothic edifice. Behind the palm-tree pulpit, look on the wall above a carved confessional to find a small memorial to ‘Petro Brevgello’; ie the artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, who once lived in the nearby Marolles.
