Musée Constantin Meunier | Brussels, Belgium |  This intimate museum occupies an Ixelles town house that was the last home and studio of Brussels-born artist Constantin Meunier (1831–1905) and presents a substantial collection of his later works. Meunier is best known for emotive sculptures and social-realist paintings, including larger-than-life bronzes depicting muscular miners from Hainaut, dock workers from Antwerp and men reaping fields.
