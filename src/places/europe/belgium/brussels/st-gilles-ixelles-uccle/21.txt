Flagey | Brussels, Belgium |  This marvellous 1938 ‘liner’ building originally conceived as the national radio building, is now the centre of an up-and-coming nightlife area. With its distinctive round ‘periscope’ tower, it’s an art deco classic that hosts a hip cafe, a cinema and various music venues.
