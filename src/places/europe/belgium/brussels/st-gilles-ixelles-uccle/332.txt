Musée David et Alice van Buuren | Brussels, Belgium |  In a 1928 art deco showpiece house you’ll find this exquisite museum, where five rooms are crammed with sublime furnishings, stained glass and top-quality paintings covering five centuries of art. Also notable are more than 30 works by van Buuren’s talented symbolist protégé, Van de Woestyne, and a Vincent van Gogh sketch for the latter’s classic Peeling Potatoes.
