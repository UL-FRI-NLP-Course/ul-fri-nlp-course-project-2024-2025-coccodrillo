Église Notre-Dame des Riches Claires | Brussels, Belgium |  From a public courtyard off Place St-Géry (go through the black steel gates next to the bistro La Lion St Géry), there's a view of Église Notre Dame des Riches Claires, an intriguing asymmetrical church. Nearby is the Nero mural, one of the city's many comic-strip murals.
