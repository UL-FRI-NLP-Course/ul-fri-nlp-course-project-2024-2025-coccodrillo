Centre Belge de la Bande Dessinée | Brussels, Belgium |  This centre offers a definitive and enjoyable overview of the country’s vibrant comic-strip culture. Even if you’re not excited by the ‘ninth art’, do peep inside the superb 1906 art nouveau building, a Victor Horta classic built as a fabric store with a wrought-iron superstructure and a glass roof. You don’t have to pay an entrance fee to enjoy the central hallway or to drink a coffee at the attached cafe.
