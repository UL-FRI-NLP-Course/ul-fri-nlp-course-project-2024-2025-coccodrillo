Zinneke | Brussels, Belgium |  In the old Bruxellois dialect, zinneke means ‘a person of mixed origins’, which sums up the city’s inhabitants to this day. Hence Flemish sculptor Tom Frantzen’s statue of a dog with its leg cocked is a proud mongrel, and has inspired the city’s most exuberant celebration of Brussels’ multifaceted make-up, the Zinneke parade.
