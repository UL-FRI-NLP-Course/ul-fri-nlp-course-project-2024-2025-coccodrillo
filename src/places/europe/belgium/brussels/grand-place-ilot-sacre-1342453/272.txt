L’Étoile | Brussels, Belgium |  The square’s smallest building, surmounted by a star, is where city hero Everard ’t Serclaes died in 1388. A fairly contemporary ‘tradition’ claims you’ll garner good luck by rubbing a 1902 brass statue of Everard’s reclining corpse. The statue adorns the house’s arcaded north wall in Rue Charles Buls, the road separating the house from the Hôtel de Ville. Also notice the lovely 1899 gilded art nouveau plaque dedicated to the city by its appreciative artists.
