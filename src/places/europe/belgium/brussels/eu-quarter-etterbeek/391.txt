Maison St-Cyr | Brussels, Belgium |  The haunting facade of this narrow building is an extravagance of knotted and twisted ironwork. It was built in 1903 for painter Léonard St-Cyr by Gustave Strauven (1878–1919), who worked as an apprentice to Horta and also built art nouveau houses in Schaerbeek.
