Musée Antoine Wiertz | Brussels, Belgium |  If you're into the shocking or nasty, this museum may appeal. Antoine Wiertz (1806–65) was a Brussels artist bent on painting giant religious canvases depicting hell and other frenzied subjects. The building was Wiertz' home and studio and was also once the residence of noted Flemish writer Hendrik Conscience.
