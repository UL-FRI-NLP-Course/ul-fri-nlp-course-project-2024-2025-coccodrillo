Train World | Brussels, Belgium |  Wonderful old engines gleam in the low light of this imaginative and beautiful museum, located in the renovated 1887 Schaerbeek station: exhibits include Le Belge, the country's first locomotive. You can climb on board the engines, wander into a historic station cottage and walk over a railway bridge. A train simulator is an added bonus.
