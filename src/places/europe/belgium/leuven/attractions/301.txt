St-Michelskerk | Leuven, Belgium |  This church's enormous baroque frontage remains impressive despite considerable age-erosion to the limestone capitals. It's topped with trumpeteer angels and the allegorical cherub frieze halfway up is enchanting.
Much of the interior is hidden due to long-term restoration. Stand in the middle of the nave to make sense of the ceiling trompe l'Å“il, which simulates the central dome that was always wanted for the church.
