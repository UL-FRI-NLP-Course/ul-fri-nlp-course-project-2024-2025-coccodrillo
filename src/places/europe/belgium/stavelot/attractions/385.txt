Eglise Saint-SÃ©bastien | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Behind a slightly shabby facade, this 1754 baroque church contains the truly magnificent sarcophagus of St-Remacle, a 1268 masterpiece of gilded metalwork containing the relics of Stavelot Abbey's founder, who had already been dead for 600 years before the casket's fabrication.
