Château de Jehay | The Ardennes, Belgium |  Like a gingerbread fantasy, this turret-spiked 1550 castle is a fabulous confection of alternating brick and stone rising from an extensive tree-ringed moat. After an extensive renovation, the estate is now open to visitors again, although the castle interior isn't accessible to the public.
Jehay is around 6km north of Amay, a mostly humdrum town whose partly 11th-century church, Église Saint-Georges et Sainte-Ode, has an unusual triple-spired portal tower. Eight times daily (thrice at weekends) bus 85 stops in Jehay between Huy (25 minutes) and Liège (50 minutes).
