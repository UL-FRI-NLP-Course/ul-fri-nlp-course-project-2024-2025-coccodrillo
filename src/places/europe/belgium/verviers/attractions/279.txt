Centre Touristique de la Laine et de la Mode | The Ardennes, Belgium |  This impressive three-part museum occupies an 1803 former mill dating from Verviers' heyday as an international wool-processing centre. The 2nd floor displays well-preserved industrial equipment, and there's a history of cloth and clothing from neolithic furs via Crusader capes to 1930s garter belts, all extensively explained through a four-language audio guide.
Changing exhibitions in the beamed eaves are often excellent and relevant to the city's history.
