Kasteel van Loppem | Bruges, Belgium |  Around 10km south of Bruges, Kasteel van Loppem is a mid-19th-century brick castle-mansion which had its moment of fame at the end of WWI when it was briefly home to the Belgian king and was the command centre for the Belgian army. There's an antique hedge maze on the beautifully manicured grounds.
