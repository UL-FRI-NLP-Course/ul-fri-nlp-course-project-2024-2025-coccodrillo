Huis van Alijn | Ghent, Belgium |  Set in a restored 1363 children’s hospice complex, this delightful museum examines everyday life from the 1890s to the present, with a fabulous emphasis on the 1960s to the '80s. Most of the exhibits are refreshingly self-explanatory, including quaint recreated shop interiors, photos of wedding fashions and a disarmingly moving collage of family home videos. There's always something new happening. The annexed café is a great spot to socialise and sample the local beers.
