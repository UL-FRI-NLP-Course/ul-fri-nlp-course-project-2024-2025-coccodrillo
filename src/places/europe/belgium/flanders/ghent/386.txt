Oude Begijnhof | Ghent, Belgium |  Ghent has three widely separated begijnhoven; Oude Begijnhof is Ghent's most central. Unlike other surviving areas, there's no remnant enclosing wall so it's just a pretty clutch of lanes around a church and green. The most photogenic alley is Provenierstersstraat.
