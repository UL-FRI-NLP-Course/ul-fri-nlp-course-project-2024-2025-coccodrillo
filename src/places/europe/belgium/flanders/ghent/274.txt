Stadhuis | Ghent, Belgium |  Ghent’s magnificent and flamboyant city hall was started in 1519 but not finished until 1600, by which time it had transformed into a Renaissance-style palazzo. It's a prime spot for weddings, but visitor access is limited to one-hour guided visits that can be booked online or through the tourist office. Don’t confuse the stadhuis with the controversial Stadshal, the modern barn-like construction located nearby.
