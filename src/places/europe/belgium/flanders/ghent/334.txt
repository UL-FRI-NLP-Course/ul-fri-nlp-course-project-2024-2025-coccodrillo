St-Annakerk | Ghent, Belgium |  The imposing and beautiful St Anne's church was designed by architect Louis Roelandt in 1851 but never completed in the true Byzantine-style he envisioned. The church first opened its doors to an adoring public in 1866, having had its original design scaled down by architect Jacques Van Hoecke, resulting in an eclectic appearance with distinctly Romanesque and Gothic signatures.
