The Last Post | Ypres, Belgium |  Every night at 8pm, traffic through the Menin Gate is halted while buglers sound the Last Post in remembrance of the WWI dead, a moving tradition started in 1928. Every evening the scene is different; buglers may be accompanied by pipers, troops of cadets or a military band. There's usually at least 100 or so visitors, most of whom have some connection to someone who was lost in Flanders Fields.
