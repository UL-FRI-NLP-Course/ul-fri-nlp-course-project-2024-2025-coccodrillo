In Flanders Fields Museum | Ypres, Belgium |  No museum gives a more balanced yet moving and user-friendly introduction to WWI history. It’s a multisensory experience combining soundscapes, videos, well-chosen exhibits and interactive learning stations at which you ‘become’ a character and follow his or her progress through the wartime period. An electronic 'identity' bracelet activates certain displays.
Located in the historical Lakenhalle.
