Antwerp Zoo | Antwerp, Belgium |  Founded in 1843, Antwerp Zoo is one of the worldâ€™s oldest and best-respected zoological parks. Enclosures in the 10-hectare site are state of the art and the breeding program has an international reputation.
There are a series of timed talks throughout the day. If you don't have time to visit properly, it's still worth walking into the entrance-yard area (no ticket required) for great views back towards the train station and for a good chance of spotting flamingos.
