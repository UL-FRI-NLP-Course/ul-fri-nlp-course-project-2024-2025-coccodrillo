Les Mouettes | Antwerp, Belgium |  Though relatively modest by Zurenborg standards, Les Mouettes is a classic of art nouveau architecture with its curls of wrought-iron balcony detailing.
The name, meaning 'the Seagulls', refers to the mosaic within the circular sweep of stone tracery over the 2nd-floor windows.
