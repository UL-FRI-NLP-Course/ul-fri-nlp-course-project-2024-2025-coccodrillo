Keizerskapel | Antwerp, Belgium |  Built in 1512 for the cloth-cutters' guild, this underrated little chapel honouring St Anne was given a major Gothic rebuild in the mid-17th century, from which the impressive altar and ex-votos are retained.
After the anti-religious period of French rule in the late 18th century, Keizerskapel was the first place in Antwerp to reopen to Catholic worship.
