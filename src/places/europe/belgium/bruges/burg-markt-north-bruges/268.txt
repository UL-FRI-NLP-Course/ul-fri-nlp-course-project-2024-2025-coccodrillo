OLV-ter-Potterie | Bruges, Belgium |  Admission to this small historical church-hospital complex is free with a St-Janshospitaal museum ticket. Ring the bell to gain entry and you’ll find fine 15th- to 16th-century art. The lushly baroque church section houses the reliquary of St-Idesbaldus and a polychrome wooden relief of Mary breastfeeding baby Jesus. In later, more prudish centuries, the Virgin’s nipple received a lacy camouflage, rendering the scene bizarrely impractical.
