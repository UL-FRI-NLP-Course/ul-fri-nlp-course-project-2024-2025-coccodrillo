St-Janshuismolen | Bruges, Belgium |  In the 13th century, Bruges' great walls were dotted with molens (windmills) where cereals were ground into flour. Four still stand on the eastern rampart and two can be visited: this, the 18th-century St-Janshuismolen, standing in its original location is one, the nearby Koeleweimolen is another. The sails are occasionally set in motion, and each houses a tiny museum.
