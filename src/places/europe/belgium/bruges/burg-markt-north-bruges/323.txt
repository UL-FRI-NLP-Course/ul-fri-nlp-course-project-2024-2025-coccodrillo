Kantcentrum | Bruges, Belgium |  The Kantcentrum displays a collection of lace in a row of interlinked old cottages. In the afternoons (2pm to 5pm) you can watch bobbin lace being made by informal gatherings of experienced lacemakers and their students who gather to chat and work here. Once you’ve seen how intricate the process is, you’ll swiftly understand why handmade lace is so expensive; a small piece costs €10.
