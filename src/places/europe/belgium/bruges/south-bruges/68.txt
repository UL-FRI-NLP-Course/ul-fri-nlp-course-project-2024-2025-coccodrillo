Begijnhof | Bruges, Belgium |  Brugesâ€™ delightful begijnhof dates from the 13th century. Despite the hordes of summer tourists, remains a remarkably tranquil haven. Outside the 1776 gateway bridge lies a tempting (if predictably tourist-priced) array of terraced restaurants, lace shops and waffle peddlers.
