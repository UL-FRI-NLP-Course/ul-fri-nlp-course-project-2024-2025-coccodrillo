Namsskogan Familiepark | Nordland, Norway |  A long way from anywhere – it's 40km south of Namsskogan, which is, in turn, 125km south of Mosjøen along the Arctic Highway – the Namsskogan Familiepark is a great way to break up the long journey north. Home to an impressive array of Arctic wildlife – highlights include Arctic fox, reindeer, elk, brown bear, wolverine, wolf and Eurasian lynx – it's a spacious, well-run place with plenty of activities for kids, among them trampolines, climbing frame, a flying fox, toboggan and horse riding.
