Seljord Church | Southern Norway, Norway |  This charming Romanesque church was built in the 12th century in honour of St Olav; it looks as if someone built a stave church and then changed their mind and tried to build a house around it. In the grounds, between the church and the churchyard wall, are two impressions reputedly made by two mountain trolls who were so upset by the encroachment of Christianity that they pummelled the site with boulders.
