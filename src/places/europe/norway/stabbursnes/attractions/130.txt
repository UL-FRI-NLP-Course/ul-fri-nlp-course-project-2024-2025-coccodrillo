Stabbursnes Naturhus og Museum | Western Finnmark, Norway |  The Stabbursnes Naturhus og Museum serves both the Stabbursdalen National Park and Stabbursnes Nature Reserve. It sells field guides, maps and fishing permits and has a well-mounted exhibition about the birds, animals and geology of the interior high plateau, river valleys and coast. It also serves as a visitor centre for the park and reserve â€“ entry to that section is free.
It is, however, worth paying the entry fee and lingering over the exhibits if you're planning on spending any time exploring the area.
