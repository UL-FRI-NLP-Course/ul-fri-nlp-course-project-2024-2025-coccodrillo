Norwegian Railway Museum | Central Norway, Norway |  Train spotters will have steam blowing out of their ears at the sight of this lovely railway museum, which brings together a fine collection of train-related ephemera â€“ from engine sheds, rail carriages and steam locomotives to vintage station paraphernalia. Of equal interest are the displays exploring the extraordinary engineering feats required to carve the railways through Norway's rugged terrain.
It's about 2km west of Hamar's town centre.
