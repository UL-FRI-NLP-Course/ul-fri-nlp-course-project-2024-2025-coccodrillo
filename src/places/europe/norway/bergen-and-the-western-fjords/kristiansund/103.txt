Norsk Klippfiskmuseum | The Northern Fjords, Norway |  This museum in an 18th-century warehouse tells you all that you could ever wish to know (and probably a lot more than that) about Kristiansund's cod-drying heritage. There are various bits of equipment, vintage photos and other fishy memorabilia, and you can sometimes watch the cod-drying process in action. From the town centre, take the Sundb√•t ferry and ask to be dropped off.
Just north of this museum are two other classic buildings, both normally closed to the public: Hjelkrembrygga, a former klippfish warehouse dating from 1835, and Woldbrygga, a barrel factory constructed in 1875.
