Kinsarvik Stone Church | Bergen & the Southwestern Fjords, Norway |  Built in around 1180, this is one of Norway's oldest stone churches. It was restored in the 1960s; the walls still bear traces of lime-and-chalk paintings depicting Michael the Archangel weighing souls while the devil tries to tip the scales. According to local legend, the church was built by Scottish invaders on the site of an earlier stave church.
