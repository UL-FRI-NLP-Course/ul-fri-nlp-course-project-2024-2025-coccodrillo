Jugendstil Senteret | Ålesund, Norway |  The city's unique architectural heritage is documented in a former pharmacy, the first listed Jugendstil monument in Ålesund. Apart from the building's own exquisite and almost entirely original interior, including a sinuous staircase and florid dining room, displays include textiles, ceramics, furniture, posters and other ephemera. Even if you're not a keen aesthete, a 'Time Machine' capsule is great fun, presenting 'From Ashes to Art Nouveau', a 14-minute multimedia story of the rebuilding of Ålesund after the great fire.
The museum shop is inside the pharmacy and still has most of its furniture and fixtures in situ – it's a delight.Ticket price also covers entry to KUBE, next door.
