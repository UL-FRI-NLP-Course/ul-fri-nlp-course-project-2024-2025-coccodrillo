Ålesund Church | Ålesund, Norway |  Built of solid stone in 1909, Ålesund's parish church has a strikingly wide chancel, every square inch covered in frescoes over the wide sweep of its tunnel arch. Notable, too, are the stained-glass windows, especially those in the northern aisle with their appropriately nautical theme.
