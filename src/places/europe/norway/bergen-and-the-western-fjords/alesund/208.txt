Alnes Lighthouse | Ålesund, Norway |  This picturesque 1853 lighthouse is in the fishing station of Alnes. For that end-of-the-world feeling, climb to the circular balcony via the five floors of this all-wood structure. Each displays the canvases of Norwegian artist and Godøy resident Ørnulf Opdahl.
There's also a cafe and an exhibition space in the old lighthouse keeper's accommodation.
