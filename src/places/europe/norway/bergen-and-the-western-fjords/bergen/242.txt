Bergen Maritime Museum | Bergen, Norway |  Located on the university campus, Bergen's sea-themed museum is worth a look for its collection of model ships, including a few Viking galleons. There are also exhibits detailing wreck finds, paintings and the seafarer's life. It's interesting enough to while away a wet afternoon, but don't go out of your way.
