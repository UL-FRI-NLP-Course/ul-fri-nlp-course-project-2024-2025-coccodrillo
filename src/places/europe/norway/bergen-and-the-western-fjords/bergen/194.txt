Fantoft Stave Church | Bergen, Norway |  This stave church, in the leafy southern suburb of Paradis, was built in Sognefjord around 1150 and moved here in 1883. It is, in fact, a reconstruction, as the original fell victim to an early-1990s black metal/neopagan church burning. The adjacent cross, originally from Sola in Rogaland, dates from 1050.
