Ole Bull Museum | Bergen, Norway |  This beautiful estate was built in 1873 as the summer residence of Norwayâ€™s first musical superstar, violinist Ole Bull. Languishing on its own private island, it's a fairy-tale concoction of turrets, onion domes, columns and marble inspired by Moorish architecture. Of particular note is the soaring pine music hall: it's hard not to imagine Bull practising his concertos in here.
Outside, the grounds are criss-crossed with 13km of lovely walks, and there's a small cafe.The best way to arrive is aboard the passenger ferry (adult/child 60/30kr, eight minutes, hourly 11am to 3pm) which runs from Buena Quay to the island.
