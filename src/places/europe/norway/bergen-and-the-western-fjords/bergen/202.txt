Cultural History Collection | Bergen, Norway |  This history museum is part of the Bergen Museum, and explores a panoply of mainly Norwegian topics â€“ from artefacts of Inuit and Aleut culture, through the Viking era and Middle Ages, all the way to Henrik Ibsen and modern Norway. The overseas collection is less extensive, although there are a few Egyptian mummies worth seeing.
