Marilyn Monroe Memorial | Bergen & the Southwestern Fjords, Norway |  Bizarrely, Haugesund claims to be the ancestral home of Marilyn Monroe, whose father, a local baker, emigrated from here to the USA. This monument on the quay, next to the Scandic Maritim Hotel, is suitably coquettish, if not a great likeness. It commemorates the 30th anniversary of her death in 1962.
