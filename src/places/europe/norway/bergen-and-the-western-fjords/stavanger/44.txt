Gamle Stavanger | Stavanger, Norway |  Gamle (Old) Stavanger, above the western shore of the harbour, is a delight. The Old Town's cobblestone walkways pass between rows of late-18th-century whitewashed wooden houses, all immaculately kept and adorned with cheerful, well-tended flower boxes. It well rewards an hour of ambling and may see you casually perusing property prices. Ah well, we can all dream.
