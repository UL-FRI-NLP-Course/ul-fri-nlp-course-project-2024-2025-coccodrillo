Stavanger Museum | Stavanger, Norway |  Stavanger's main museum was founded in the 19th century, and it's a typically wide-ranging affair, encompassing everything from Stavanger's history to Viking culture and a vast array of spooky stuffed animals in the natural history section. It's in a huge, rather gloomy building on Mus√©gata, which was renovated in 2017 to accommodate the Norwegian Children's Museum.
