Peer Gynt Galleriet | The Northern Fjords, Norway |  An only-in-the-fjords extravaganza, bas-relief wood carvings fashioned by local carpenter Oddvin Parr illustrate the Peer Gynt legend, along with a 35-minute audiovisual show (three daily in English). There's an attached cafeteria with lovely big windows overlooking the fjord.
