Church of St Olav | The Western Fjords, Norway |  Often known locally as 'the English Church', this charming wooden chapel was built in 1897 in the style of a traditional stave church. It gets its nickname from the lady who built it: English expat Margaret Green, who married a local hotel-owner. Should you find it closed, the owner of Midtnes Hotel has the key. There are occasional guided tours.
