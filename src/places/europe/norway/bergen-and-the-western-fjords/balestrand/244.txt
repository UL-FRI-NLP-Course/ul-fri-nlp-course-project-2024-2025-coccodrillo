Sognefjord Aquarium | The Western Fjords, Norway |  This modest, rather old-fashioned aquarium focuses on the saltwater inhabitants of the Sognefjord, with some 24 aquariums stocked with crustaceans, fish and plankton. It's interesting enough to while away a couple of hours on a wet day.
The entry price includes an hour of canoe or rowing-boat hire.
