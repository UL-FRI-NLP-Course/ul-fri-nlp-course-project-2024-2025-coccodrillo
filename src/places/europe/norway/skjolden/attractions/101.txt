Dale Kyrkje | The Western Fjords, Norway |  Spectacular wooden stave churches get all the attention around here, but this little gem of a medieval parish church built of stone shouldnâ€™t be overlooked. Constructed around 1250, it's mainly Gothic in style with a wooden tower and elaborately painted western entrance (the work of a typically near-anonymous ecclesiastical artist known simply as 'Nils the Painter') that were added in the early 1600s. The crucifix above the chancel arch and fine multicoloured pulpit are from the church's earliest days.
The naive 16th-century paintings in the chancel were revealed only in the 1950s, when the whitewash was removed.
