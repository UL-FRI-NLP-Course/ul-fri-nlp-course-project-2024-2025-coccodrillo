Graveyard | Longyearbyen, Norway |  Southwest of the town centre lies a haunting little graveyard with simple white, wooden crosses. It dates from the early 20th century and includes the bodies of seven young men who were struck down by the Spanish flu in October 1918, a virus that killed 40 million people in Europe, Asia and North America.
It's a lonely spot with good views across the valley to the town.
