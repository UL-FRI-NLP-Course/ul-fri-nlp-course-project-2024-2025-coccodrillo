Galleri Svalbard | Longyearbyen, Norway |  Galleri Svalbard features the Svalbard-themed works of renowned Norwegian artist Kåre Tveter (1922–2012), so pure and cold they make you shiver, as well as works by other artists, such as Olav Storø (www.storoe.no). It also has fascinating reproductions of antique maps of Svalbard, historical drawings with a Svalbard focus and temporary exhibitions. The gallery has a small cafe and an excellent shop.
Out the back and upstairs is the Kunstnersenteret, a collection of local art and craft outlets with items for sale.
