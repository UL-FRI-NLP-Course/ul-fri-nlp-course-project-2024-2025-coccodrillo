E-huset | Nordland, Norway |  In the tiny fishing hamlet of Nes, this delightful, engagingly informative small museum celebrates the eider duck and the way the birds were nurtured as domestic pets, when they returned – each one to its very same nesting box – after their winter migration. The E-house occupies a former trading post, which still retains its original counter and row upon row of goods that your great-grandparents used to buy.
