Gudbrandsjuvet | The Northern Fjords, Norway |  Fifteen kilometres up the valley from Valldal, this popular viewpoint overlooks a maelstrom of foaming, crashing water, where the river sluices and thunders through a 5m-wide, 20m-deep canyon. It's an impressive sight, enhanced by a rusting steel viewing walkway built as part of the National Tourist Routes project. There's a cafe nearby.
