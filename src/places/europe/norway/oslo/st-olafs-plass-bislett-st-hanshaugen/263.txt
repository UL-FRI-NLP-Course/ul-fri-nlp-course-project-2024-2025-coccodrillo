St Hanshaugen Park | Oslo, Norway |  This huge park is a locals' favourite and, from its top, a very pleasant place to get a view of the city. The neighbourhood's name – a reference to 'midsummer hill' – comes from the park, not the other way around, as it was a popular spot for midsummer bonfires.
