Vigelandsparken | Oslo, Norway |  The centrepiece of Frognerparken is an extraordinary open-air showcase of work by Norway's best-loved sculptor, Gustav Vigeland, and is home to 212 granite and bronze pieces by the artist. His highly charged oeuvre includes entwined lovers, tranquil elderly couples, bawling babies and contempt-ridden beggars. Speaking of bawling babies, his most famous work here, Sinnataggen (Little Hot-Head), portrays a child in a mood of particular ill humour.
