Oslo City Museum | Oslo, Norway |  Near the southern entrance to Vigeland Park, this charming museum is housed in the 18th-century Frogner Manor, built on the site of a Viking-era great house. It's a lovely snapshot of traditional bourgeois Norwegian life of the era and there are other exhibitions about Oslo's urban history.
