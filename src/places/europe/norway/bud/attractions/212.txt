Drågen Smokehouse | The Northern Fjords, Norway |  Petter Aune set up this operation, where freshly caught Aukra salmon are smoked with pure local wood and herbs, after tiring of the poor quality industrial product. It's one of only a few left in Norway and the resulting salmon does indeed have the elusive 'smakupplevelse' – a melt-in-your-mouth quality. Come here to see the process, sample and buy.
