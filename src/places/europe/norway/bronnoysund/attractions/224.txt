Hildurs Urterarium | Nordland, Norway |  Around 400 types of herb, 100 varieties of rose and 1000 species of cactus flourish at Hilde's Herb Garden, about 6km north of Brønnøysund; the team also produces their own wine. There are some rustic old farm buildings, a small art gallery and a shop that carries locally grown products. The garden also makes a lovely stop for lunch.
