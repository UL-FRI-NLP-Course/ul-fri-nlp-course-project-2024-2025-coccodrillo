German Naval Signals HQ | Guernsey, The Channel Islands |  Don't let its low-key appearance fool you: at this bunker complex, the German Naval Commander handled the most important radio communications by the German forces during the occupation. Numerous rooms have been made to look as they did during wartime, from figures dressed in replica uniforms to the original radio equipment, Enigma enciphering machines and simple, functional staff bedrooms. Next door to the Collinette Hotel.
