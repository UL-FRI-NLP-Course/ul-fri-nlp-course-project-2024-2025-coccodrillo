Alderney Society Museum | The Channel Islands, Europe |  This well-cared for museum, run by volunteers, does a fine job of telling the story of Alderney â€“ from original Neolithic settlements going back 10,000 years through to the island's role in Roman trade, centuries of enmity with France and the resulting Victorian fort-building. Special attention is paid to the traumatic WWII period, when the vast majority of islanders were evacuated, and it gives a human face to the German invaders, with photos of off-duty soldiers collecting shellfish.
