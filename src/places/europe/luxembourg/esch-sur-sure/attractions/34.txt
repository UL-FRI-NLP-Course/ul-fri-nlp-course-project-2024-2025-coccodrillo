Château d'Esch-sur-Sûre | Luxembourg, Europe |  Reached from the village by a small flight of steps, the stone ruins of Esch-sur-Sûre's castle are free to explore, and provide swooping valley views of the river and village below. Built in 927 and enlarged in the 13th century, the castle was dismantled by Louis XIV's troops in 1685. Renovations have shored up the remains of its towers, which are illuminated at night.
