MNHA | Luxembourg City, Luxembourg |  Startlingly modern for its Old Town setting, the national art and history museum starts deep in an excavated rocky basement with exhibits of Neolithic flints, then sweeps you through Gallic tomb chambers, Roman mosaics and Napoleonic medals to an excellent if small art gallery. Cézanne and Picasso get a look-in while Luxembourg's Expressionist artist Joseph Kutter (1894–1941) gets a whole floor.
