Abaata Fortress | Georgia, Europe |  At the north end of Primorsky Park in Staraya Gagra, the surviving walls of the 4th-to-5th-century AD Abaata fortress enclose some of Russian Prince Oldenburgsky's early-20th-century resort buildings (now turned into an attractive hotel), the lovely little 6th-century Church of St Ipatius and an interesting small museum on Gagra's history.
