Clock Tower | Tbilisi, Georgia |  One of old Tbilisi's most emblematic structures is also one of its newest, a higgledy-piggledy clock tower, built by puppet master Rezo Gabriadze during a renovation of his theatre in 2010. On the hour an angel pops out of a door near the top and strikes the bell outside with a hammer.
