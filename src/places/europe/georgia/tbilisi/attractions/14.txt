Kartlis Deda | Tbilisi, Georgia |  This 20m-tall aluminium symbol of Tbilisi holds a sword in one hand and a cup of wine in the other â€“ a classic metaphor for the Georgian character, warmly welcoming guests and passionately fighting off enemies. It's a short walk along the ridge from Narikala Fortress and the cable-car station.
