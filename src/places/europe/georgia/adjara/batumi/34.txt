Ortajame Mosque | Batumi, Georgia |  Batumi’s only surviving mosque, built in the 1860s, is finely painted in pinks, greens and blues, with Quranic calligraphy on the walls – but is no longer big enough to accommodate the faithful who overflow on to the streets during Friday prayers. Batumi's Muslims have been seeking permission to build a second mosque for years, but it has still not been granted, largely due to objections from the Georgian Orthodox Church.
