Batumi Boulevard | Batumi, Georgia |  Everyone soon finds themselves strolling along Batumis bulvari, the park strip fronting the main beach, originally laid out in 1884 and now stretching 7km along the coast. With its trees, paths, fountains, cafes, beach bars and a few quirky attractions, this is the life and soul of Batumi. The beach itself is fine, though stony â€“ extremely busy in July and August, but kept very clean.
