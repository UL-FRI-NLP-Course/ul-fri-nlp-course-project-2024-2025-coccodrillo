Soviet-Georgian Friendship Monument | Great Caucasus, Georgia |  This highly unusual concrete monument a short distance from the main Georgian Military Hwy and some 4km north of Gudauri is also known as the Gudauri View Point. While relations been Georgia and its northern neighbour may have soured since its construction in 1983, it remains worth wandering down to for its fabulous tiled murals and amazing valley views.
