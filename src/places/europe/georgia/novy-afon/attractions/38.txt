Stalin's Dacha | Georgia, Europe |  Sitting proudly overlooking the sea and within earshot of the bells of Novy Afon Cathedral, this dacha (country cottage) regularly hosted Joseph Stalin during his summer holidays, during which time the entire surrounding area would have been thick with snipers. You can visit the various rooms of the dacha, including the long balcony with wonderful views, although few furnishings are original.
