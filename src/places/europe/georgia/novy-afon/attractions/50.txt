Novy Afon Monastery | Georgia, Europe |  The multi-gold-domed Novy Afon Monastery, founded by Russian monks in the 1870s, stands out on the hillside, about a 15-minute walk up from the main road. Its cathedral, often thronged with worshippers, has wonderfully colourful murals in varying states of decay. Modesty cloaks are available at the entrance for anyone with bare knees or shoulders.
