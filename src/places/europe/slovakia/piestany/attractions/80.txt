Spa Museum | Slovakia, Europe |  Much more than the history of Pie코콘any's spa culture, this wide-ranging regional museum exhibits Roman artefacts, gorgeous art-nouveau posters from the last century and intricately embroidered folk costumes. Look out for display cases of crutches, supposedly left behind in Pie코콘any after the thermal waters worked their magic.
