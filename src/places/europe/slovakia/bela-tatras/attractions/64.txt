Belianska Cave | Tatra Mountains, Slovakia |  Six kilometres south of Ždiar, this cave stimulates the imagination with stalactite-filled chambers and the acoustics of its 'Music Hall' (you may be encouraged to sing). Visits are by 70-minute guided tour (in Slovak only), an interesting ramble along 1.3km of rock-carved pathways.
The cave is signposted from the Ždiar–Tatranská Lomnica road. Buses between the two will stop at Tatranská Kotlina on request.
