Wooden Church | Eastern Slovakia, Slovakia |  This Protestant wooden church was built in 1717 without a single nail. Its impressive baroque interior is carved from yew and spruce, even the huge church organ, and the ceiling is awash in 18th-century frescoes.
The admission fee includes entry to the New Evangelical Church, just opposite.
