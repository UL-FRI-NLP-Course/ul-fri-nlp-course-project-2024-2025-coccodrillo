Ždiar House Museum | Tatra Mountains, Slovakia |  Displayed within a creaky and quaint house built in Goral (Slovak and Polish shepherd) style, this small museum paints a colourful picture of Ždiar's agrarian culture over the past two centuries. There isn't much signage but farming implements, embroidered folk costumes and peculiar mannequins offer a glimpse of Goral tradition.
It's worth hanging around for filling, meaty fare in the adjoining restaurant.
