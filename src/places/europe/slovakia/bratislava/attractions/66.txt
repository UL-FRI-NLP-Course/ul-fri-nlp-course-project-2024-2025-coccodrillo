Transport Museum | Bratislava, Slovakia |  This transport museum is housed in a 19th-century steam-train station. There is not much explanation in English – or in general – but it's good for kids (or parents) who would enjoy getting close to gleaming 1930s Mercedes Benz, 1940s tram cars, clacking train-station clocks and wizened maps of Slovakia.
Most interesting are the steam trains parked in the open-air section.
