Watcher | Bratislava, Slovakia |  Crowds amass around the ground-level Watcher statue, who peeps out from an imaginary manhole on Pansk√°. Originally installed as a joke in 1997, the statue's popularity allowed him to stick around. The statue is commonly referred to as "Man at Work" after he was given his own road sign, which stands next to him.
The figure is variously interpreted as an ogler or a lazy Soviet workman; either way, there's sometimes a queue for a selfie with him.
