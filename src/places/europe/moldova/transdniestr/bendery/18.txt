Memorial Park | Moldova, Europe |  At the entrance to the city, just west of the Benderyâ€“Tiraspol bridge, is a memorial park dedicated to local 1992 war victims. An eternal flame burns in front of an armoured tank, from which flies the Transdniestran flag.
Haunting memorials to those killed during the civil war are also scattered throughout many streets in the city centre.
