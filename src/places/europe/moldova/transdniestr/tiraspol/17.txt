Tiraspol National History Museum | Moldova, Europe |  No period of Transdniestran history is ignored at this relatively interesting museum, starting with photos of late-19th-century Tiraspol, moving to the Soviet period and the Great Patriotic War, to the civil war of 1992.
The latter gets its own big room, featuring photos that really bring the conflict to life. The museum also has a few ethnographic displays.
