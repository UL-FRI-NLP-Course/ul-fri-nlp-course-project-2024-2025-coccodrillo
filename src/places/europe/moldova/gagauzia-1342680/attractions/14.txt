Comrat Regional History Museum | Moldova, Europe |  Aside from the usual range of Lenin statues, tanks and other Soviet time pieces, about the only sight in Comrat is this museum dedicated to Gagauz culture and history. Behind its ornately carved wooden doors you'll find a dizzying hotchpotch of mundane to fascinating items, seemingly collected from townspeoples' attics, including photos of noteworthy locals, weapons, stuffed animals and ethnographic displays.
