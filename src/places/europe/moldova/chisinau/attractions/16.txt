National Art Museum | Chişinău, Moldova |  A massive facelift was half-finished at the end of 2018, with the gorgeously restored main wing open to visitors. The focus is on contemporary Moldovan art, with a room or two of European works (mainly Dutch, Flemish and Italian) plus space for rotating exhibitions. The annex at the back contains a more extensive European collection, plus folk art and icons, but it remains closed indefinitely.
