National Library | Chişinău, Moldova |  A landmark, the neoclassical National Library is worth popping into both to check out the beautiful interior with its spiral staircases, and for the free rotating art exhibitions in the cavernous 2nd- and 3rd-floor hallways. Unlimited use of public computers costs 15 lei. Grab a drink afterwards in the stylish Biblioteque Cafe just outside.
