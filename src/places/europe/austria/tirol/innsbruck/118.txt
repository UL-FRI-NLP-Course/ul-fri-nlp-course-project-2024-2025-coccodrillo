Tiroler Landesmuseum Ferdinandeum | Innsbruck, Austria |  This treasure trove of Tyrolean history and art moves from Bronze Age artefacts to the original reliefs used to design the Goldenes Dachl. Alongside brooding Dutch masterpieces of the Rembrandt ilk, the gallery displays an astounding collection of Austrian art including Gothic altarpieces, a handful of Klimt and Kokoschka paintings, and some shocking Viennese Actionist works.
More specific to Tyrol are the late-baroque works by fresco master Paul Troger, Alfons Walde's Kitzb√ºhel winterscapes and Albin Egger-Lienz' sombre depictions of rural life in postwar Tyrol.
