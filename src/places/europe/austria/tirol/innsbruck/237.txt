Volkskunst Museum | Innsbruck, Austria |  The Volkskunst Museum presents a fascinating romp through Tyrolean folk art from hand-carved sleighs and Christmas cribs to carnival masks and cowbells. On the 1st floor is a beautifully restored Gothic Stube (parlour) complete with low ceiling, wood panelling and an antique tiled oven.
