Starkenberger Biermythos | Tyrol, Austria |  Housed in a medieval castle, this 200-year-old brewery sits 3km north of Imst in Tarrenz. A visit dashes through the brewing process and includes a beer tasting. If you can’t get enough of the stuff, you can even bathe in it by calling ahead – it does wonders for the complexion, apparently.
