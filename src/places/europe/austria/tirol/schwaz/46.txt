Silberbergwerk | Tyrol, Austria |  You almost feel like breaking out into a rendition of ‘Heigh-Ho’ at Silberbergwerk Schwaz, as you board a mini train and venture deep into the bowels of the silver mine for a 90-minute trundle through Schwaz’ illustrious past. The mine is about 1.5km east of the centre.
