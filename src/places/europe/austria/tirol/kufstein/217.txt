Römerhofgasse | Tyrol, Austria |  A classic saunter leads along gingerbready Römerhofgasse, a reconstructed medieval lane that looks fresh-minted for a Disney film set with its overhanging arches, lanterns and frescoed facades. Even the crowds and souvenir kitsch – marmot ointment, Dirndls, strapping Lederhosen, you name it – detract little from its appeal.
