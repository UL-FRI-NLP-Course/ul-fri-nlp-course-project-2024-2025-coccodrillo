Schloss Leopoldskron | Salzburg, Austria |  The grand rococo palace of Schloss Leopoldskron is where the lake scene was filmed in The Sound of Music. Its Venetian Room was the blueprint for the Trapps' lavish ballroom, where the children bid their farewells. It's now a plush hotel, but you can admire it from the outside. It's a 15-minute walk from Festung Hohensalzburg.
