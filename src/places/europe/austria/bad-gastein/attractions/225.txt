Nikolauskirche | Hohe Tauern National Park, Austria |  The late-Gothic Nikolauskirche is a little gem of a church, tiled with wood shingles and built around a central pillar. Its interior is simple yet beautiful, with an uneven flagstone floor, baroque altar and rudimentary frescoes that are fading with age. Look out for the statue of the 16th-century physician Paracelsus outside.
