Landhaus | Klagenfurt, Austria |  The Renaissance Landhaus (state parliament) dates from the late 16th century and is still the centre of political power today. The stairs on the right (facing the portico) lead up to the Grosser Wappensaal (Heraldic Hall), with its magnificent trompe i'oeil gallery painted by Carinthian artist Josef Ferdinand Fromiller (1693â€“1760).
