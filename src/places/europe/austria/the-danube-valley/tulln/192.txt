Egon Schiele Birthplace | The Danube Valley, Austria |  This interpretive, interactive museum is based in a touching recreation of Egon Schiele's actual birthplace and family home. The son of the local station master Adolf Schiele, Egon Schiele spent the first 11 years of his life, from 1890, in the apartment at the train station that came with his father's job. The exhibition looks at his childhood and the influences he was exposed to as a boy.
