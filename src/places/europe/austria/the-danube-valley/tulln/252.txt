Museum im Minoritenkloster | The Danube Valley, Austria |  This city-promoted museum space features some excellent changing exhibitions based around mostly Austrian artists. Schiele has made a couple of appearances (surprise, surprise). Admission prices and opening times vary according to exhibition. It adjoins the Minorite church.
