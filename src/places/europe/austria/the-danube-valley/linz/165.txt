Landesgalerie | Linz, Austria |  Housed in a sumptuous late-19th-century building, the Landesgalerie focuses on 20th- and 21st-century paintings, photography and installations. The rotating exhibitions often zoom in on works by Upper Austrian artists, such as Alfred Kubin's expressionist fantasies and Valie Export's shocking Viennese Actionistâ€“inspired pieces. The open-air sculpture park contrasts modern sculpture with the gallery's neoclassical architecture.
