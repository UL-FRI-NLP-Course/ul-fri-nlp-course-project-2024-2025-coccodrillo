Weissenkirchen Parish Church | The Danube Valley, Austria |  This 15th-century Gothic church sits on a hilltop overlooking the town; its front doors are approached along a labyrinth of covered pathways. Look out for the baroque altar (you can't miss it) and loll about on its garden terrace with lovely Danube views.
