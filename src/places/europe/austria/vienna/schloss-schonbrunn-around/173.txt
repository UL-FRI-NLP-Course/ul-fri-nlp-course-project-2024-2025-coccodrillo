Gloriette | Vienna, Austria |  From 1772 to 1780 Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf added some of the final touches to the Schloss Schönbrunn palace park under the instructions of Joseph II. The stately Gloriette building, its crowning glory, was added in 1775. The view, looking back towards the palace with Vienna shimmering in the distance, ranks among the best in the city. It’s also possible to venture onto the roof.
