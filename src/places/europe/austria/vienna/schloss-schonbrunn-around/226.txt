Wagenburg | Vienna, Austria |  The delightful Wagenburg displays carriages ranging from tiny children’s wagons up to sumptuous vehicles of state, but nothing can compete with Emperor Franz I Stephen’s (1708–65) coronation carriage. Weighing in at four tonnes (4000kg) and dripping in ornate gold plating, it has Venetian-glass panes and painted cherubs.
