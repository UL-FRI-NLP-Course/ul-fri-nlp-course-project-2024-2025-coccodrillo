Volksgarten | Vienna, Austria |  Spreading out between the Burgtheater and Heldenplatz, the Volksgarten is great for relaxing among dignified rose bushes and even more dignified statues. A monument to Empress Elisabeth is in the northeast corner, not far from the Temple of Theseus, an imitation of the one in Athens (commissioned by Napoleon), and the Volksgarten ClubDiskothek.
