Helmut-Zilk-Platz | Vienna, Austria |  Wedged between the Staatsoper and the Albertina, this square stands out for its Monument Against War & Fascism by Alfred Hrdlicka (1988). The series of pale, block-like sculptures has a dark, squat shape wrapped in barbed wire, representing a Jew scrubbing the floor; poignantly, the greyish block originally came from the Mauthausen concentration camp.
