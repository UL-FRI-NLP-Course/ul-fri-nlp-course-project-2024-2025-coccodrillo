Burggarten | Vienna, Austria |  Tucked behind the Hofburg, the Burggarten is a leafy oasis amid the hustle and bustle of the Ringstrasse and Innere Stadt. The marble statue of Mozart is the park’s most famous tenant, but there’s also a statue of Franz Josef in military garb. Lining the Innere Stadt side of the Burggarten is the Schmetterlinghaus and the beautiful Jugendstil (art nouveau) Palmenhaus bar.
