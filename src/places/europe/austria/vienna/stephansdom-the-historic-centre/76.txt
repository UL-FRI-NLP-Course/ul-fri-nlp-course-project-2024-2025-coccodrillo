Römer Museum | Vienna, Austria |  This small expanse of Roman ruins dating from the 1st to the 5th century CE is thought to be part of the officers’ quarters of the Roman legion camp at Vindobona. You can see crumbled walls, tiled floors and a small exhibition of artefacts here, along with a 3D film with English subtitles.
