Dom- & Diözesanmuseum | Vienna, Austria |  The Cathedral and Diocesan Museum of Vienna is a treasure trove of religious art pieces spanning a period of more than 1000 years. Among the collection's extraordinary exhibits are the earliest European portrait – of Duke Rudolf IV (1360) – and two Syrian glass vessels (1280–1310), thought to be among the oldest glass bottles in the world.
