Rossauer Kaserne | Vienna, Austria |  This huge red-brick complex, today housing the police, Defence Department and Vienna’s traffic office, was originally built as a barracks after the 1848 revolution. It’s a rather fanciful affair, replete with pseudo-medieval turrets and massive entranceways; it was restored after being damaged in bombing during WWII.
