Kunstforum | Vienna, Austria |  The private Kunstforum museum gets about 300,000 visitors each year, and for good reason – it stages an exciting program of changing exhibitions, usually highlighting crowd-pleasing modernist or big-name contemporary artists. The work of Miquel Barceló, Fernando Botero, Frida Kahlo, Balthus and Martin Kippenberger have all had their turn in recent years.
