Beinhaus | Hallstatt, Austria |  This small ossuary contains rows of neatly stacked skulls, painted with decorative designs and the names of their former owners. Bones have been exhumed from the overcrowded graveyard since 1600, and although the practice waned in the 20th century, the last joined the collection in 1995. It stands in the grounds of the 15th-century Catholic Pfarrkirche (parish church), which has some attractive Gothic frescoes and three winged altars inside.
