Gustav Klimt Zentrum | The Salzkammergut, Austria |  High-tech multimedia exhibits provide an overview of symbolist painter Gustav Klimt's life and works on the Attersee, which for Klimt fans is comparable to Claude Monet’s Giverny. There's also a cinema screening informative films with English subtitles. You can rent an audioguide (€4) here for the lakeside Gustav Klimt-Themenweg trail, which is dotted with information boards.
