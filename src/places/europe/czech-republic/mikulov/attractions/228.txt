Goat Hill | Moravia, Czechia |  Goat Hill is topped with an abandoned 15th-century lookout tower offering stunning views over the Old Town. To find it, walk steeply uphill from the entrance to the Jewish Cemetery. Note that the tower keeps irregular hours: it's only open when the flag is flying. But even if the tower is closed, the views from the hilltop are spectacular.
