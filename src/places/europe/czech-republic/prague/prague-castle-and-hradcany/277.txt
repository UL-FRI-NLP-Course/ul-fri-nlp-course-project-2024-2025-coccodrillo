South Gardens | Prague, Czechia |  This terrace garden offers superb views across the rooftops of Malá Strana and permits a peek into the back garden of the British embassy. There are entrances at the castle's eastern end, and via stairs from the Third Courtyard; the gate at Hradčany Square is for exit only.
