Rosenberg Palace | Prague, Czechia |  This Renaissance palace once served as the 'Institute of Noblewomen' â€“ effectively a home for aristocratic ladies fallen on hard times, founded by Empress Maria Theresa in 1755. The palace chapel, decorated with trompe l'oeil paintings and frescoes, soars three storeys high, and there's a re-creation of a lady's bedchamber, complete with commode and elaborate period mousetrap!
