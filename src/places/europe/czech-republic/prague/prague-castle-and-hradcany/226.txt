Powder Tower | Prague, Czechia |  A passage to the north of St Vitus Cathedral leads to the Powder Tower, also called Mihulka, which was built in the 15th century as part of the castle’s defences. Later it became the workshop of cannon- and bell-maker Tomáš Jaroš, who cast the bells for St Vitus Cathedral. Today it houses an exhibition on the history of the Castle Guard.
