Falconer's House | Prague, Czechia |  For those with a particular interest in falconry, the latest exhibition to open at Prague Castle is a 17th-century falconer's house located near the riding school. After watching a film on falconry, guides show you around the small dwelling packed with gloves, hoods and perches. You can only see it by calling ahead or visiting either of the information centres beforehand.
