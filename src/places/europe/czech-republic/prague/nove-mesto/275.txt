Cubist Lamp Post | Prague, Czechia |  Angular but slightly chunky, made from striated concrete – the world's only cubist lamp post is passed by many and overlooked by most. It's a 1913 work by architect Emil Králíček, the man behind the Adamova Pharmacy on Wenceslas Square and the Diamant House in Spálená St.
