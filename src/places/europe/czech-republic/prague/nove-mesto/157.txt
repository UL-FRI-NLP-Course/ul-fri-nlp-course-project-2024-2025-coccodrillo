Faust House | Prague, Czechia |  The baroque palace at the southern end of Charles Square is known as Faust House because, according to the popular German legend, this was where Mephistopheles carried Dr Faust away to hell through a hole in the ceiling. The building also has associations with Rudolf IIâ€™s English court alchemist, Edward Kelley, who toiled here in the 16th century trying to convert lead into gold.
