Rašínovo nábřeží 78 | Prague, Czechia |  This apartment building, designed by the grandfather of the late president Václav Havel, was where Havel first chose to live (in preference to Prague Castle) after being elected as president in December 1989 – surely the world’s least pompous presidential residence. A small plaque by the entrance, installed in 2019, simply reads 'Zde jsem taky žil' ('I lived here, too').
