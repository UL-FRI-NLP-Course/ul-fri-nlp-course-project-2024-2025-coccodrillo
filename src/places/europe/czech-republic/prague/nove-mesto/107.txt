Prague Main Train Station | Prague, Czechia |  What, a railway station as a tourist attraction? Perhaps not all of it, but it's certainly worth heading to the top floor for a look at the newly renovated splendour of the original art-nouveau entrance hall, designed by Josef Fanta and built between 1901 and 1909.
The domed interior is adorned with a mosaic of two nubile ladies, the Latin inscription Praga: mater urbium (Prague: Mother of Cities) and the date ‘28.října r:1918’ (28 October 1918, Czechoslovakia’s Independence Day). The hall, which once served as the main ticket office (you can still see the ticket windows), now houses a cafe.
