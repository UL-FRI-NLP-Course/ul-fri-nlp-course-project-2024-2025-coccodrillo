Jindřišská Tower | Prague, Czechia |  This bell tower, dating from the 15th century but rebuilt in Gothic style in the 1870s, dominates the end of Jindřišská, a busy street running northeast from Wenceslas Square. Having stood idle for decades, the tower is now Prague's most commercially utilised, housing an exhibition space, whisky bar, cafe and restaurant, plus a lookout point on the 10th floor.
