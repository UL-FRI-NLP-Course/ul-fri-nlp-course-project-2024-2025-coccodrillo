Jan Palach Memorial | Prague, Czechia |  In January 1969 university student Jan Palach set fire to himself in front of the National Museum to protest against the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia the preceding August. Palach later died from his burns and became a national hero. The memorial sits at the exact spot where Palach fell, marked by a cross in the pavement just below the steps to the museumâ€™s entrance.
