Mánes Gallery | Prague, Czechia |  Spanning the Vltava between the embankment and Slovanský Island and cowering beneath a 15th-century water tower, the Mánes Building (1927–30) is a masterpiece of functionalist architecture designed by Otakar Novotný. It houses an art gallery founded in the 1920s by a group of artists headed by painter Josef Mánes, and is still one of Prague’s best venues for viewing visiting contemporary-art shows.
