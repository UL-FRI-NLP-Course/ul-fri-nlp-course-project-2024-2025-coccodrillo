U Kalicha | Prague, Czechia |  This is where the eponymous antihero was arrested at the beginning of Jaroslav Hašek’s comic novel of WWI, The Good Soldier Švejk (which Hašek cranked out in instalments from his own local pub). The pub is milking the connection for all it’s worth – it’s an essential port of call for Švejk fans, but the rest of us can find cheaper beer and dumplings elsewhere.
