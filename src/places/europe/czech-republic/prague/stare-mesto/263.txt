Lego Museum | Staré Město, Prague |  This museum claims to have the largest private collection of Lego models in the world, with a play area at the end where kids can build stuff from Lego and a shop selling almost every set going. The exhibition doesn't quite justify the high admission price, however, unless you are a real Lego fanatic.
