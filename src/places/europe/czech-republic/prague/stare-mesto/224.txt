Colloredo-Mansfeld Palace | Staré Město, Prague |  The grand halls of this 18th-century aristocratic palace have been restored and now serve as an exhibition space for the City of Prague Gallery. If the temporary exhibition doesn't light your fire, you can always just wander the baroque corridors and visit the amazing period ballroom, which appeared in Miloš Forman's 1984 film Amadeus.
