Museum of Czech Cubism | Staré Město, Prague |  Though dating from 1912, Josef Gočár’s House of the Black Madonna (Dům U černé Matky Boží) – Prague’s first and finest example of cubist architecture – still looks modern and dynamic. It houses an exhibition of the Museum of Decorative Arts' collection of cubist furniture, ceramics and glassware, as well as displays on Prague's unique cubist architecture and a cubist cafe.
