Jan Palach Square | Staré Město, Prague |  Jan Palach Square is named after the young Charles University student who, in January 1969, set himself alight in Wenceslas Square in protest against the Soviet invasion. On the eastern side of the square, beside the entrance to the philosophy faculty building where Palach was a student, is a bronze memorial plaque with a ghostly death mask.
Palach is buried in the Olšany Cemetery.
