Art Gallery for Children | Staré Město, Prague |  The clue is in the name: at the Art Gallery for Children the kids not only get to look at art, but make it, add to it and alter it. There are paints and materials to play with, and even workshops for five- to 12-year-olds (only in Czech at present, though staff speak English).
