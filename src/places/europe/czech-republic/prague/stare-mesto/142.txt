Chapel of Mirrors | Staré Město, Prague |  This chapel dates from the 1720s and is an ornate confection of gilded stucco, marbled columns, fancy frescoes and ceiling mirrors – think baroque on steroids. Classical-music concerts are held here daily, often featuring leading soloists from top Czech orchestras (tickets are available at most ticket agencies). The chapel is included in guided tours of the Klementinum, provided no events are taking place at the time.
