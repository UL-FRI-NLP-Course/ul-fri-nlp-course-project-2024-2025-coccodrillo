Viola Building | Staré Město, Prague |  The art nouveau facade of this former home of the Prague Insurance Co was designed by Osvald Polívka, with the huge letters ‘PRAHA’ entwined around five circular windows, and mosaics spelling out život, kapitál, důchod, věno and pojišťuje (life, capital, income, dowry and insurance). The building next door, a former publishing house, is also a Polívka design.
