Brownnosers (David Černý) | Prague, Czechia |  This sculpture by visual artist David Černý dates from 2003 and is on permanent display at Smíchov's Futura Gallery. The work shows former president Václav Klaus and artist Milan Knížák feeding each other human waste, and can be viewed by climbing a ladder and peering through the backsides of the figures. A comment on what the author must view as an unhealthy relationship between power and the arts – or something like that!
