Staropramen Brewery | Prague, Czechia |  More of a museum visit than an actual brewery tour, the presentation here focuses on the 100-plus years of history of the brewery, the only big nationwide Czech brewer based in Prague. The reward for your time is a glass of Staropramen at the end. See the website or check tour times on the door. English tours are normally conducted at 10am, 1pm and 4pm, though the times can differ by the day.
