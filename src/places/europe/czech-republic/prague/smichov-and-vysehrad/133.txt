Brick Gate & Casements | Prague, Czechia |  The Brick Gate & Casements highlight Vyšehrad's role as a military fortress in the 17th and 18th centuries, a period when the area was fought over by Austrian, Prussian and French forces. There's an exhibition on the history of Prague’s fortifications as well as a system of tunnels where soldiers would muster for battle. The highlight is the barrel-vaulted Gorlice Hall, which houses six original statues from Charles Bridge. Visits are by guided tour, which normally depart on the hour.
