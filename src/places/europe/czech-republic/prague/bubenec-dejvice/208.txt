Lapidárium | Prague, Czechia |  An outlying branch of the National Museum and an often-overlooked gem, the Lapidárium is a repository for some 400 sculptures from the 11th to the 19th centuries. The exhibits include Bohemia’s oldest surviving stone sculpture, parts of the Renaissance Krocín Fountain that once stood on Old Town Square, and several original statues from Charles Bridge.
