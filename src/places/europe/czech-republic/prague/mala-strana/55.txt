Franz Kafka Museum | Malá Strana, Prague |  This much-hyped and slightly overpriced exhibition on the life and work of Prague’s most famous literary son, entitled ‘City of K’, explores the intimate relationship between the writer and the city that shaped him, through the use of original letters, photographs, quotations, period newspapers and publications, and video and sound installations.
