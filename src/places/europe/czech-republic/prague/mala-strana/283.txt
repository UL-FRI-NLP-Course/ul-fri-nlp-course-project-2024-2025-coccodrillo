Vojan Gardens | Malá Strana, Prague |  While less manicured than most of Malá Strana’s parks, Vojan Gardens is a popular spot with locals (mostly because it's free) who like to come here to take a breather with the kids, sit in the sun over a supermarket picnic, or even hold low-key summer parties.
