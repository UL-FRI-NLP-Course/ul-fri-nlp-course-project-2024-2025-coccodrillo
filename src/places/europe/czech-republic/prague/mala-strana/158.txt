Memorial to the Victims of Communism | Malá Strana, Prague |  This striking sculptural group consists of several ragged human figures (controversially, all are male) in progressive stages of disintegration, descending a staggered slope. A bronze strip inlaid into the ground in front of them records the terrible human toll of the communist era – 205,486 arrested, 170,938 driven into exile, 248 executed, 4500 deaths in prison and 327 shot while trying to flee across the border.
