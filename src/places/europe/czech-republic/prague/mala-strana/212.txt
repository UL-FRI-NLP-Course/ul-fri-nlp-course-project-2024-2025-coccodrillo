Petřín Funicular Railway | Malá Strana, Prague |  First opened in 1891, Prague’s funicular railway now uses modern coaches that trundle back and forth on 510m of track, saving visitors a climb up Petřín. It runs every 10 to 20 minutes from Újezd to near the Petřín Lookout Tower, with a stop at Nebozízek. A full-price ticket or day pass is required to ride.
