DEPO2015 | Plze≈à, Czechia |  Housed in a former tram depot, this 'makerspace' is a creative hub that provides working space for tech start-ups, artists and craftspeople, and houses various exhibitions of art, design and ideas for alternative lifestyles. There's also a good cafe, and a street food festival that takes place two or three times a year. It's just over 1km south of the town centre.
