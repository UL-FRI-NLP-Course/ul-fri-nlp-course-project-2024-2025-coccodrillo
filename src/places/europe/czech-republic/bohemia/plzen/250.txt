Puppet Museum | Plzeň, Czechia |  Plzeň's museum of marionettes and puppetry is well done and certainly worth a look, especially if you're travelling with younger children. The exhibits are understandably heavy on Czech puppet tradition, but there's ample signage in English and even some impromptu puppet performances to keep young ones interested.
