Church of Sts Peter & Paul | Karlovy Vary, Czechia |  This impressive Orthodox Church, with five polished onion domes and art-nouveau exterior murals, was apparently modelled after a similar church near Moscow. One of the church's most prominent decorations is a relief depicting Tsar Peter the Great.
