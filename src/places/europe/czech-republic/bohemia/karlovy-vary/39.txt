Mill Colonnade | Karlovy Vary, Czechia |  The most impressive piece of architecture in Karlovy Vary is the neo-Renaissance Mill Colonnade (built 1871â€“81), with five different springs, rooftop statues depicting the months of the year, and a little bandstand. The Petra Restaurant, opposite, is the spot (but not the original building) where Peter the Great allegedly stayed in 1711.
