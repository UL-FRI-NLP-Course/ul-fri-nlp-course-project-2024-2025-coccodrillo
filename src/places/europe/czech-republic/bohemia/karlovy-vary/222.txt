Market Colonnade | Karlovy Vary, Czechia |  The only one of the town's colonnades to be crafted from wood, this beautiful neoclassical structure dates from the 1880s and was the work of the fabled Viennese architectural firm of Fellner & Helmer. The bronze panel above the Charles IV Spring (pramen Karla IV) depicts the discovery of the hot springs by Emperor Charles in the 14th century.
