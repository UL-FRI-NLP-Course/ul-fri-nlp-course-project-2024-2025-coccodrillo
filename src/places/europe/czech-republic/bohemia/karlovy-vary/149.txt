Church of Mary Magdalene | Karlovy Vary, Czechia |  Karlovy Vary's most important Catholic church and one of its grandest baroque buildings, this imposing, twin-steepled structure in the heart of the spa dates from the 1730s and is the work of baroque master Kilian Dientzenhofer, the architect of St Nicholas Church in Prague's Mal√° Strana. The crypt contains an underground altar and an ossuary containing the bones from the 18th-century graveyard that once surrounded the church.
