Diana Funicular Railway | Karlovy Vary, Czechia |  Just beside (to the north of) the Grandhotel Pupp, a narrow alley leads to the bottom station of the Diana Funicular Railway, which climbs 166m to great views from the Diana Lookout Tower. Departures are every 15 minutes. It's a pleasant walk back down through the forest.
