Hot Spring Colonnade | Karlovy Vary, Czechia |  The Hot Spring Colonnade is in an incongruous concrete-and-glass functionalist structure built in 1975 and once dedicated to Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. It houses the most impressive of the town's geysers, Pramen Vřídlo, which spurts some 12m into the air; people lounge about inhaling the vapours or sampling the waters from a line of taps in the main hall.
