Včerejší svět | Bohemia, Czechia |  Located just across the bridge at the northeast end of town, 'Yesterday's World' is a hard one to classify – part museum of old bicycles, prams, toys and other wheeled objects, part antique shop, and part cafe. Whatever it is, it's all quite fascinating. From October to April, you can arrange a visit by phone, or take pot luck and ring the doorbell.
