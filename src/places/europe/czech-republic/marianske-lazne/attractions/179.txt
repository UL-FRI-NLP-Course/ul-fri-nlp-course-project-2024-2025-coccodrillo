Municipal Museum | Bohemia, Czechia |  The tiny Municipal Museum occupies the house where Goethe stayed during his last visit to Mariánské Lázně. The exhibits cover the visits of Goethe and Britain's King Edward VII, local geology and natural history, and are labelled mostly in Czech. Perhaps the most interesting thing is a 20-minute video in English on the history of the spa (filmed in 1987 and comically dated in parts).
