St George Museum | Bohemia, Czechia |  This museum, housed beneath the southern terrace of Konopiště chateau, is testament to one of Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s obsessions: St George. Here he collected scores of renderings of the mythical dragon-slayer in a purpose-built gallery; this is only some 10% of the hoard.
