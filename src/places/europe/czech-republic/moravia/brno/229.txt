Bishop's Court | Brno, Czechia |  The Bishop's Court Museum houses a small aquarium that might hold the kids' attention for a few minutes; other than that, there's plenty of information on Moravian wildlife and lots of stuffed animals, though not much information in English. Buy tickets at the cash desk in the nearby Moravian Museum.
