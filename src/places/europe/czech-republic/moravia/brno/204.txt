Technical Museum | Brno, Czechia |  Brno's Technical Museum highlights technical and industrial progress over the last two centuries and is worth a half-day of anyone's time. Don't miss the panoptikon on the first floor; this huge wooden stereoscope allows up to 20 viewers to look at 3D images from antique glass slides that are changed on a regular basis.
