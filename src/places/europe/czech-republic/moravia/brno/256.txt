Mendel Museum | Brno, Czechia |  Gregor Mendel (1822â€“84), the Augustinian monk whose studies of pea plants and bees at Brno's Abbey of St Thomas established modern genetics, is commemorated here in a series of photographs and displays (with plenty of information in English). In the garden are the foundations of Mendel's original greenhouse.
