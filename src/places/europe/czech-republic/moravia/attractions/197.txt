Building 14|15 Baťa Complex | Moravia, Czechia |  This museum incorporates the holdings of the former Bat'a Shoe Museum. On display is a permanent exhibition titled 'The Bat'a Principle: Today Fantasy, Tomorrow Reality.' There are tons of interesting and interactive displays on the history of Zlín and the Baťa shoe company, filled with old photos, machinery and maps (and, of course, lots of shoes over the ages).
