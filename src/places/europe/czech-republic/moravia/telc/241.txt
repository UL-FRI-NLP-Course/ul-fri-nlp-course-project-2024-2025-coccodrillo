Church of St James | Moravia, Czechia |  The Church of St James's impressive 60m-high Gothic tower dominates the central square. This 15th-century church replaced an older building dating from the 14th century that burned to the ground. It's been remodelled several times over the years and its modern appearance owes much to the neo-Gothic craze of the 19th century.
