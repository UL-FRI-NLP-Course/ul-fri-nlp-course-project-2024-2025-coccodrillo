Church of the Holy Spirit | Moravia, Czechia |  The church and adjoining tower date from the late-Romanesque period of the early 13th century. The church has been rebuilt several times over the centuries, but the 49m tower is original and the town's oldest surviving building. Climb around 100 steps to the top for pretty views out over the historic core and surrounding area.
