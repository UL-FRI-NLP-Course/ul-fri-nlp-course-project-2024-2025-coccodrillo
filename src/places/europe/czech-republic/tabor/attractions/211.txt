Žižkovo Náměstí | Bohemia, Czechia |  Tabor's handsome main square is lined with late-Gothic, Renaissance and baroque houses. In the middle is a fountain (1567) and a commanding statue of the Hussite leader Jan Žižka, after whom the square is named. The former late-Gothic town hall stands at the western end of the square and houses the Hussite Museum.
