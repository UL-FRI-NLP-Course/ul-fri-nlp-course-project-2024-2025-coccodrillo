Church of the Virgin Mary & St Giles | Bohemia, Czechia |  This stately Gothic church and attached Augustine monastery complex date to the 14th century. Peek inside the church to see original late-Gothic artwork on the walls and one of the country's most important works of Gothic statuary, a Madonna dating from 1400. Daily tours in Czech are offered at 3pm, though ask at the Tourist Information Centre about occasional English tours.
