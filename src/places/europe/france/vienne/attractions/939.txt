Théâtre Romain | Lyon & the Rhône Valley, France |  This vast, well-preserved Roman amphitheatre was built around AD 40–50 at the base of Mt Pipet, on the eastern fringes of the old town. At that time, it was one of the largest theatres in the Roman empire – it was designed to seat 11,000 spectators. It's a key venue during Vienne's Jazz Festival in June and July.
