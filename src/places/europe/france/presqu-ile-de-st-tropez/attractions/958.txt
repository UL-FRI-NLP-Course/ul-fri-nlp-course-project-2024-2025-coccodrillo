Sémaphore de Camarat | Côte d'Azur, France |  France’s second-tallest lighthouse by light-source (nearly 130m above the waves), is a squat, imposing tower completed in 1832. Electrified in 1946, it was automated from 1977. Scale it for giddy views of St-Tropez and the peninsula. Guided tours run June to September; book at the Ramatuelle tourist office.
