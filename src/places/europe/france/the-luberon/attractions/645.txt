Château de Lacoste | The Luberon, France |  This part-ruined, 9th-century château once belonged to the scandalous Marquis de Sade (1740–1814) but was bought in 2001 by the couturier Pierre Cardin. The marquis retreated here in 1771, when his writings became too scandalous for Paris. The château was looted by revolutionaries in 1789, and the 45-room palace remained an eerie ruin until Cardin arrived. It hosts an arts festival every July. Daytime visits are possible only by reservation.
