Musée des Beaux-Arts | Nîmes, France |  The city’s fine-arts museum has a fairly pedestrian collection of Flemish, Italian and French works, although it’s worth a look for the fine Roman mosaic, Marriage of Admetus, which can be viewed from the 1st floor.
It's located about 200m south of Les Arènes.
