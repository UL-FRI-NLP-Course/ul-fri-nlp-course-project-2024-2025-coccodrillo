Carré d’Art – Musée d'Art Contemporain | Nîmes, France |  The striking glass-and-steel Carré d’Art was designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster. Inside is the Musée d’Art Contemporain, with permanent and temporary exhibitions covering art from the 1960s onwards. The rooftop restaurant (open Wednesday to Sunday) makes a lovely spot for a drink.
