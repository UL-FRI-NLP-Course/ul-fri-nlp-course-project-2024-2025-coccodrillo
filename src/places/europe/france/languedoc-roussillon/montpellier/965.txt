Cathédrale St-Pierre | Montpellier, France |  Noted for its disproportionately tall porch, Montpellier’s monumental Cathédrale St-Pierre began life as a church attached to the 14th-century monastery of St-Benoît; it was raised to cathedral status in 1536. Heavily rebuilt after the Wars of Religion, it’s now the seat of the city’s archbishops.
