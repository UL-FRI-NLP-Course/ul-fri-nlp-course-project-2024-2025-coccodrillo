Musée du Vieux Montpellier | Montpellier, France |  This municipal museum has a fairly pedestrian collection of local-interest pieces ranging from furniture to paintings and antique weaponry, but it’s worth a visit as it’s one of the few hôtels particuliers (private mansions) open to the public. Highlights include a 15th-century tabernacle that contains a 13th-century Black Virgin, a gilded table-clock and a wonderful ivory cabinet.
