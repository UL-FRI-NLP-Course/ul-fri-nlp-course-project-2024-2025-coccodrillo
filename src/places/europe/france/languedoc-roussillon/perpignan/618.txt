Place de la Loge | Perpignan, France |  Three fine stone structures flank place de la Loge. The 14th-century La Loge de Mer was rebuilt during the Renaissance; it was once Perpignan’s stock exchange, then its maritime tribunal. Sandwiched between it and the Palais de la Députation, once seat of the local parliament, is the Hôtel de Ville, with a typically Roussillon façade.
