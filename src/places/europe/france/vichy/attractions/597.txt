Hall des Sources | Auvergne, France |  Chug a mouthful of reputedly healing waters at the Hall des Sources, a late-19th-century atrium resembling an art-deco greenhouse. The water is naturally fizzy with a saline tang, if you're curious.
Not all of the nine sources of Vichy's reputedly healing waters are freely accessible: some, like the Source de l’Hôpital, also within the Parc des Sources, require a medical prescription.
