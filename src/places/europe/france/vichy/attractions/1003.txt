Parc Napoléon III | Auvergne, France |  These 13 hectares of peaceful parkland, landscaped in honour of Napoléon III, have become a favourite riverfront idling ground for pedestrians and cyclists.
Look out for Swiss-style, 19th-century chalets along the park's edge, which once lodged Vichy's visiting curistes.
