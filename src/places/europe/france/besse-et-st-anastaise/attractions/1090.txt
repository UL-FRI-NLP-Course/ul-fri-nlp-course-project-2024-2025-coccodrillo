Le Beffroy | Parc Naturel RÃ©gional des Volcans d'Auvergne, France |  One monumental gateway remains of Besse's medieval fortifications, crowned by the octagonal 16th-century Beffroy, the town's most distinctive feature. Lift your gaze to the top and you'll see an old wolf's-head weathervane still trembling in the wind.
