Vieille Ville | Alsace, France |  Along the main street that threads through the old town, keep an eye out for the 17th-century Pfifferhüs, which once housed the town’s fife-playing minstrels; the hôtel de ville and its Renaissance fountain; and the nearby, clock-equipped Tour des Bouchers (Butchers’ Bell Tower).
