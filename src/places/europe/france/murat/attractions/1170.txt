Église Collégiale Notre-Dame | Parc Naturel Régional des Volcans d'Auvergne, France |  Dating to the end of the 14th century, the church in Murat's medieval heart bears a few Gothic flourishes from additions made during the 19th century. It's worth looking inside to see the ornate Baroque-inspired altar.
