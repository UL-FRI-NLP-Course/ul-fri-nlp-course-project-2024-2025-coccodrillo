Musée de Vence | Côte d'Azur, France |  With its wonderful 20th-century art exhibitions, this daring art museum inside the imposing Château de Villeneuve offers a nice contrast to Vence’s historic quarter. Matisse-lovers will appreciate the recently opened permanent exhibit on the 2nd floor, which showcases the city of Vence's private collection of six dozen works by the great artist, displayed on a rotating basis.
