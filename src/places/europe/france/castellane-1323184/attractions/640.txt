Chapelle Notre Dame du Roc | Gorges du Verdon, France |  This hillside chapel sits high above Castellane at an altitude of 903m, wedged into a cleft between the mountains and offering a panoramic view across the valley. There has been a chapel of some form since the 9th century, although the present structure largely dates from later reconstruction in the 18th century. The chapel is accessed via a steep, winding path from town; allow about an hour there and back, or a bit longer if you take things slow.
