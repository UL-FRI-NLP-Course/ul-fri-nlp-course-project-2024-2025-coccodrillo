Musée Sirènes et Fossiles | Gorges du Verdon, France |  Mermaids and fossils feature at this worthwhile paleontology museum, which explores the geological past of the Alps – hard to believe this whole mountain range once lay at the bottom of a vast temperate sea. It's worth combining with a walk along the 2km Sentier des Siréniens, which passes through areas of ancient fossils.
