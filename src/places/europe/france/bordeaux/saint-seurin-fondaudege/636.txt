Institut Culturel Bernard Magrez | Bordeaux, France |  Glittering glass chandeliers, parquet flooring, original moulded ceilings and pretty peppermint-green painted wood-panelling create a wonderfully romantic backdrop for the compelling contemporary-art exhibitions held at Château Labottière. The neoclassical chateau was constructed in 1773 for Bordelais brothers Antoine and Jacques Labottière who ran a small printing business in Bordeaux and is owned today by the Bernard Magrez cultural institute.
