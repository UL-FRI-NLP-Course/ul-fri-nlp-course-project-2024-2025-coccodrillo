Musée de la Préhistoire | The Pyrenees, France |  In the town just north of the Grotte du Mas d'Azil, this prehistory museum contains a trove of objects unearthed in the nearby caves. It's small, but well worth visiting, particularly for its reproductions of cave art from the Grotte du Mas d'Azil, which are not accessible to visitors at the caverns.
