Musée du Temps | Besançon, France |  Literal and figurative interpretations of time are woven together at the Musée du Temps, which places allegorical paintings about the passage of time next to 18th-century wall clocks and early astronomical equipment. The result is beautifully thought-provoking, and the philosophical questions it raises are best pondered while gazing out from the tower, which houses a Foucault’s pendulum.
