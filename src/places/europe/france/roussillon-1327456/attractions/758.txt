Mines de Bruoux | The Luberon, France |  In Gargas, 7km east of Roussillon, this former mine has more than 40km of underground galleries where ochre was once extracted. Around 650m are open to the public, some of which are as much as 15m high. Visits are only by guided tour; reserve ahead as English-language tours are at set times.
The caverns sometimes provide a stunning setting for concerts; check the website for schedules.
