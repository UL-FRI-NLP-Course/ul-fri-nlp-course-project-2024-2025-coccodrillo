Place des Cornières | The Dordogne, France |  From the town’s three gateways, Monpazier’s flat, grid-straight streets lead to the arcaded market square (also known as place Centrale), surrounded by an ochre-hued collection of stone houses that reflect centuries of building and rebuilding. In one corner is an old lavoir once used for washing clothes. Thursday is market day, as it has been since the Middle Ages.
