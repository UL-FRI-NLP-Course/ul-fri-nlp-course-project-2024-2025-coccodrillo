Musée d'Art e d'Industrie | Lyon & the Rhône Valley, France |  Set in a palatial 19th-century building, this museum showcases St-Étienne's three big industries back in the day, namely bicycles, ribbons and guns! Despite the disparate topics, the thoughtfully designed displays provide an illuminating look at the past. The two-wheeled collection (with some pieces dating back to the 1860s) is a must for cycling fans.
