Musée Grévin | Paris, France |  This large (and expensive) waxworks inside the passage Jouffroy has some 300 wax figures. They largely look more like caricatures than characters but, still, where else do you get to see Marilyn Monroe, Charles de Gaulle and Spiderman face to face, or the original death masks of some of the French Revolution leaders?
