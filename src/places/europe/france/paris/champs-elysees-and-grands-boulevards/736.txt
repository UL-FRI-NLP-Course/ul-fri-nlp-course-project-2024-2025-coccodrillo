Théâtre-Musée des Capucines | Paris, France |  A separate wing of the Perfume Museum is located a short distance south in the Théâtre-Musée des Capucines. The activity in this early 20th-century theatre concentrates largely on the bottling (for example, in crystal flasks from Bohemia) and packaging side of perfume-making. There’s a decent short film here and, of course, a shop selling Fragonard products.
