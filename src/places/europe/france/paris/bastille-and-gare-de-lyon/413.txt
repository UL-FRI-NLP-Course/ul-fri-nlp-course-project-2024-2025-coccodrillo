Parc Floral de Paris | Paris, France |  This magnificent botanical park is a highlight of the Bois de Vincennes. Natural landscaping, a Japanese bonsai pavilion, an azalea garden and several ponds with water lilies and lotuses impress garden lovers, while Parisâ€™ largest play area (slides, jungle gyms, sandboxes) thrills families with young children. For bigger kids, there are plenty of paid-for activities too, including minigolf (featuring Parisian landmarks), a ropes course and table tennis (equipment rental available). Not all facilities are open outside the warmer months.
Free open-air concerts staged throughout summer make it a first-rate picnic destination.
