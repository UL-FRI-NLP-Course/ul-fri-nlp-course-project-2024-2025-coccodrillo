Parc de Bagatelle | Paris, France |  Few Parisian parks are as romantic as this, created as the result of a wager in 1775 between Marie-Antoinette and the Count of Artois. Irises bloom in May, roses between June and October, and – perhaps most magnificently of all – water lilies in August and September. The pièce de résistance is the château itself, built for the younger brother of Louis XVI in the 18th century.
