Galerie-Musée Baccarat | Paris, France |  Showcasing 1000 stunning pieces of crystal, many of them custom-made for princes and dictators of former colonies, this flashy museum is at home in its striking new rococo-style premises designed by Philippe Starck in the ritzy 16e. It is also home to an upmarket restaurant called – what else? – Le Cristal Room.
