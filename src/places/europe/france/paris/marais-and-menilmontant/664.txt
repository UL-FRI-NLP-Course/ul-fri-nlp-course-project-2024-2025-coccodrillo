Maison Européenne de la Photographie | Le Marais, Ménilmontant & Belleville, Paris |  The European House of Photography, housed in the overly renovated Hôtel Hénault de Cantobre (dating – believe it or not – from the early 18th century), has cutting-edge temporary exhibits (usually retrospectives on single photographers), as well as an enormous permanent collection on the history of photography and its connections with France.
There are frequent showings of short films and documentaries on weekend afternoons.
