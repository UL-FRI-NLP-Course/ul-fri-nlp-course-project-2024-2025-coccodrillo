Ben art work | Le Marais, Ménilmontant & Belleville, Paris |  In 1993 iconic Niçois artist Ben set to work on one wall of a red-brick building overlooking rue de Belleville. Look up to spot two men appearing to be installing a huge black board, on which it is written in white in the artist's distinctive cursive handwriting 'Il faut se méfier des mots' (Be wary of words).
