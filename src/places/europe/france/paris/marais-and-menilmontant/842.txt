Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature | Le Marais, Ménilmontant & Belleville, Paris |  Collections at the Hunting and Nature Museum, inside the delightful Hôtel de Guénégaud (1651), include paintings, sculptures and objets d’art related to hunting and lots and lots of trophies (horns, antlers, heads). It will be closed for renovations between summer 2019 and autumn 2020 that will expand the crammed space and add an on-site tearoom.
