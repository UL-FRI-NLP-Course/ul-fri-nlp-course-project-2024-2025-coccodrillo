Mosquée de Paris | Latin Quarter, Paris |  Paris’ central mosque, with a striking 26m-high minaret, was completed in 1926 in an ornate art deco Moorish style. You can visit the interior to admire the intricate tile work and calligraphy. A separate entrance leads to the wonderful North African–style hammam, restaurant and tearoom, and a small souk (actually more of a gift shop). Visitors must be modestly dressed.
