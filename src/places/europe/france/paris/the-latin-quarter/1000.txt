Arènes de Lutèce | Latin Quarter, Paris |  The 2nd-century Roman amphitheatre Lutetia Arena once seated 10,000 people for gladiatorial combats and other events. Found by accident in 1869 when rue Monge was under construction, it’s now used by locals playing football and, especially, boules (similar to lawn bowls). Hours can vary.
