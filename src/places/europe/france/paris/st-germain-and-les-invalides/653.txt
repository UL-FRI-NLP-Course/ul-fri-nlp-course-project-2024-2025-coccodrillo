Fondation Dubuffet | St-Germain & Les Invalides, Paris |  Situated in a lovely 19th-century hôtel particulier (private mansion) at the end of a courtyard, the foundation houses the collection of Jean Dubuffet (1901–85), chief of the Art Brut school (a term he himself coined to describe all works of artistic expression not officially recognised). Much of his work is incredibly modern and expressive. Closed for renovation work at the time of research, it is expected to reopen in mid-2019.
