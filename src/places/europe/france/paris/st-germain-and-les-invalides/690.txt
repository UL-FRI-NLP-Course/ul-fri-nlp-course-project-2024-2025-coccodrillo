Église du Dôme | St-Germain & Les Invalides, Paris |  With its sparkling golden dome (1677–1735), the landmark church of Hôtel des Invalides is one of the finest religious edifices erected under Louis XIV and was the inspiration for the United States' Capitol building. It received the remains of Napoléon in 1840; the extravagant Tombeau de Napoléon 1er comprises six coffins fitting into one another like a Russian doll.
