FluctuArt | St-Germain & Les Invalides, Paris |  Opened in 2019, this hip cultural centre occupying a p√©niche (barge) off pont des Invalides brought an unexpected dash of coolness to an otherwise institutional neighbourhood. It claims to be the first floating urban art centre in the world and hosts the works and creations of all kinds of emerging artists. There are exhibition spaces as well as a vibrant bar and a restaurant.
