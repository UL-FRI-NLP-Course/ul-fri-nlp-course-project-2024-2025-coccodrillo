Palais du Luxembourg | St-Germain & Les Invalides, Paris |  At the northern end of the Jardin du Luxembourg, the Palais du Luxembourg was built in the 1620s for Marie de Médici, Henri IV’s consort, to assuage her longing for the Pitti Palace in Florence. Since 1958, the palace has been home to the Sénat (French Senate).
