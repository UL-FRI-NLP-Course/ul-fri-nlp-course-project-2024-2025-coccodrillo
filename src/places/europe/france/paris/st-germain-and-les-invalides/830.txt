Basilique Ste-Clotilde | St-Germain & Les Invalides, Paris |  Resembling a mini Notre Dame, with twin conical steeples and flying buttresses at the rear, this delightful basilica presides over a pretty park. Dating from 1856, its sculptures, paintings and stained glass are the handiwork of some of the 19th century's finest artists, including Pradier, Pr√©ault, Guillaume, Lenepveu and Thibaut. The organ is magnificent.
