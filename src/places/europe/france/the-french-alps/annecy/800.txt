Église St-Maurice | Annecy, France |  A pale sandstone church, Annecy's oldest, made all the more dazzling by the turquoise Canal du Thiou running alongside it. Step through the 15th-century church’s door to see the understated Gothic interior, its slate-grey rib vaults flecked in gold leaf.
Église St-Maurice was originally built as a Dominican chapel in 1422, but was enlarged over subsequent centuries.
