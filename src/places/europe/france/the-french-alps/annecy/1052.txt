Cath√©drale St-Pierre | Annecy, France |  A former Franciscan chapel consecrated in 1535, Annecy's cathedral has a Renaissance-meets-Gothic style. Drawing attention from the unadorned walls are a mighty 19th-century organ, weighing 10 tonnes, a large rose window, and columns capped with ornate capitals.
