Église St-Pantaléon | Troyes, France |  Faded with age and all the more enigmatic for it, this Renaissance-style, cruciform church, with its barrel-vaulted wood ceiling, is a great place to see the work of the 16th-century Troyes School – check out the sculptures attached to the columns of the nave. The west façade was added in the 18th century. History sheets are available.
