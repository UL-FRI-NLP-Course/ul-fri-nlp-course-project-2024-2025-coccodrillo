Apothicairerie de l’Hôtel-Dieu-le-Comte | Troyes, France |  If you come down with an old-fashioned malady – scurvy, perhaps, or unbalanced humours – the place to go is this fully outfitted, wood-panelled pharmacy from 1721. Rare majolica and earthenware pharmaceutical jars share shelf space with decorative pill boxes and bronze mortars.
