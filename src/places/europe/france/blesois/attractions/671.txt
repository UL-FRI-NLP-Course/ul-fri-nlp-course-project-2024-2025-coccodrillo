Les Secrets de Moulinsart | The Loire Valley, France |  Fans of Tintin might find the façade of Château de Cheverny strangely familiar: Hérgé used it as a model (minus the two end towers) for Moulinsart (Marlinspike) Hall, the ancestral home of Tintin’s irascible sidekick, Captain Haddock. Devotees large and small may enjoy this interactive exhibition, which explores the world of Tintin with recreated scenes, thunder and other special effects.
