Galerie Lympia | Nice, France |  Nice's coolest new gallery space is housed in this former galley slaves' prison down by the port. Opened in 2017 by the Alpes-Maritimes' departmental government after a €2.1-million restoration project, it hosts regular free exhibitions of works by Niçois artists such as Patrick Moya, along with artists from further afield.
