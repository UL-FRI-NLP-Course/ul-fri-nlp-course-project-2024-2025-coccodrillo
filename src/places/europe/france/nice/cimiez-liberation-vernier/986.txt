Musée Archéologique de Nice | Nice, France |  The hodgepodge of Roman artefacts in this archaeological museum is rather ho-hum – but if you've already bought a Nice museum pass, it's worth a visit just to wander the grounds, which afford some lovely views of Matisse's villa and the adjacent Roman baths, all backed by rows of cypress trees.
