Monastère Notre Dame de Cimiez | Nice, France |  Painters Henri Matisse and Raoul Dufy are buried in the cemetery of this monastery, a five-minute walk across the park from the Musée Matisse. To reach Matisse's grave, turn left after crossing through the gate and weave through the grandiose family plots down to the lower cemetery, where you'll find a flat stone monument engraved with the names of the artist and his wife, Amélie.
