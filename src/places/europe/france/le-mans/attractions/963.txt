Wilbur Wright Monument | The Loire Valley, France |  At the base of a soaring allegorical sculpture (1920) by Paul Landowski – who later designed Rio de Janiero's Christ the Redeemer monument – a plaque commemorates a little-known detail of aviation history: the 1908 visit to Le Mans by Wilbur Wright, at the invitation of automotive pioneer Leon Bollée.
