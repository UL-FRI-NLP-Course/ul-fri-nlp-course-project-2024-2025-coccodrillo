Grotte de Dargilan | Languedoc-Roussillon, France |  Just south of the Gorges de la Jonte, Grotte de Dargilan is known as La Grotte Rose (Pink Cave) for its rosy colouring. The most memorable moment of the one-hour, 1km tour through this vast chasm with plenty of stalagmites and stalactites is a sudden, dazzling exit onto a ledge, with a dizzying view of the gorge way below.
