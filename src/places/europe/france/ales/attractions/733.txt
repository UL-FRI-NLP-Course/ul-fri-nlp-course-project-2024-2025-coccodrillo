Musée du Désert | Languedoc-Roussillon, France |  In the village of Le Mas Soubeyran (17km west of Alès), this intriguing museum traces the history of the Camisard revolt, a bloody religious struggle that raged in the early 1700s between the Catholic armies of Louis XIV and a guerrilla band of around 1000 Protestant Huguenots, led by the charismatic Rolland. It contains artefacts such as forbidden Huguenot crosses, antique bibles and Camisard weapons.
