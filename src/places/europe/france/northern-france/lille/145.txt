Palais des Beaux Arts | Lille, France |  Inaugurated in 1892, Lille's illustrious Fine Arts Museum claims France's second-largest collection after Paris' Mus√©e du Louvre. Its cache of sublime 15th- to 20th-century paintings include works by Rubens, Van Dyck and Manet. Exquisite porcelain and faience (pottery), much of it of local provenance, is on the ground floor, while in the basement you'll find classical archaeology, medieval statuary and 18th-century scale models of the fortified cities of northern France and Belgium.
The free, interactive Visioguide app offers five itineraries through the museum. You can download the app to your smartphone at the ticket desk or via the website.
