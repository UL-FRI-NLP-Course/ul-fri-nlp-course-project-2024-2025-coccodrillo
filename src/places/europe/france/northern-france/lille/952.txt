Op√©ra | Lille, France |  Lille's Louis XVI-style opera house was built between 1907 and 1913 by French architect Louis-Marie Cordonnier, who was responsible for many of northern France's and Belgium's monumental buildings. Due to the outbreak of WWI, it wasn't inaugurated until 1923. Today it hosts opera, dance and classical concerts.
