Mus√©e Portuaire | Dunkirk, France |  Set inside a 19th-century tobacco warehouse, this museum will delight fans of maritime history and, especially, model ships. During school holidays you can go aboard a lighthouse ship, a river barge and the Duchesse Anne, a three-masted training ship built for the German merchant marine in 1901 and transferred to France as WWII reparations.
