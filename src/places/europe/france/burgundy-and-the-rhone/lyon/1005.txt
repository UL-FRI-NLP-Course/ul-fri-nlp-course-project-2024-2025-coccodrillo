Musée Miniature et Cinéma | Lyon, France |  This maze-like museum on tourist-busy rue St-Jean provides an unusual insight into the making of movie sets and special effects achieved with the use of miniatures.
Astonishing works of vivid, realistic detail depict markets, theatres, barber shops and other breadbox-sized scenes.
