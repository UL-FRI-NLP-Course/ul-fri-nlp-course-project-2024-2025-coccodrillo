Mur des Canuts | Lyon, France |  Said to be Europe's largest fresco, this magnificent trompe l'oeil shows a slice of daily life among Lyon's residents. The work is packed with intricate details, and nearby signage explains the development of the painting.
The work was created in 1987, but extensively updated to reflect the changing face of the neighbourhood in 1997 and in 2013.
