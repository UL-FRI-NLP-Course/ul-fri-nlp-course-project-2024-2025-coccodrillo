Villa Grecque Kérylos | Côte d'Azur, France |  This magnificent dwelling is a reproduction of a 1st-century Athenian villa, complete with baths, stunning mosaic floors and furniture such as dining recliners. It was designed by scholar-archaeologist Théodore Reinach in 1902, at a time when the must-have for well-to-do socialites was an eccentric house on the Côte d’Azur.
