Lac Chambon | Parc Naturel RÃ©gional des Volcans d'Auvergne, France |  The relatively shallow (and thus warmish) waters of Lac Chambon, 1.5km west of Murol, make this crater lake a much-loved place for families to splash around in summer. Canoes and pedalos can be rented from operators along the shore during summer. Even in winter the frost-dusted beaches are popular with ramblers. Walking the trail around the shore takes an hour.
There are toilets and picnic tables near the summer-only tourist information point on the main beach.
