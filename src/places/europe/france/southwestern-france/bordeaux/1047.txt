Église Ste-Marie de la Bastide | Bordeaux, France |  La Bastide's neo-medieval church, consecrated in 1884, was designed by Paul Abadie (1812–84) – the same architect who designed the Basilica de Sacre-Coeur in Montmartre, Paris – hence the signature bulbous stone dome crowned by an elegant lantern on balusters.
