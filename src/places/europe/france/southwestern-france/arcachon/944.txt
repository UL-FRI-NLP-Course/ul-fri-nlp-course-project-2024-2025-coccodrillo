Ville d’Hiver | Arcachon, France |  On the tree-covered hillside south of the Ville d'Été, the century-old Ville d'Hiver (Winter Quarter) has more than 300 villas, many decorated with delicate wood tracery, ranging in style from neoGothic through to colonial. It's an easy stroll or a short ride up the (free) art-deco public lift in Parc Mauresque.
