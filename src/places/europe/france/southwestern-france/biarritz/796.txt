Musée de la Mer | Biarritz, France |  Housed in a wonderful art deco building near the old port, Biarritz' Musée de la Mer is seething with underwater life from the Bay of Biscay and beyond, including huge aquariums of sharks, playful grey seals and tropical reef fish, as well as exhibits exploring Biarritz' whaling past. In high season it's possible to have the place almost to yourself by visiting late at night.
