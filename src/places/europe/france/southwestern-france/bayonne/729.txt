Rue des Faures | Bayonne, France |  This pretty street was once home to the city's bayonet-making blacksmiths, but it's now reinvented itself as the artisan quarter. It's a lovely place to browse, with galleries, bookshops, a vintage-sewing-machine restorer, a luthier (stringed instrument builder or repairer), a linen shop and one of the last remaining makhila makers â€“ the wooden staffs traditionally carried by Basque shepherds.
