Tour de la Chaîne | La Rochelle, France |  To protect the harbour at night in times of war, an enormous chain was raised between the two 14th-century stone towers at the harbour entrance to La Rochelle, giving rise to the name Tour de la Chaîne (Chain Tower). There are superb views from the top and an insightful exhibition on French migration to the New World, hence Quebec, in the 17th and 18th centuries.
