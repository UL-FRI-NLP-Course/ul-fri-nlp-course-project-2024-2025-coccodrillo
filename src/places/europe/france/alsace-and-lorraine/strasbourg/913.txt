Le Vaisseau | Strasbourg, France |  Science is never boring at this interactive science and technology museum, 2.5km southeast of central Strasbourg. There are plenty of hands-on activities to amuse little minds, from crawling through an ant colony to creating cartoons and broadcasting the news. Take tram line B, C or F to the Winston Churchill stop.
