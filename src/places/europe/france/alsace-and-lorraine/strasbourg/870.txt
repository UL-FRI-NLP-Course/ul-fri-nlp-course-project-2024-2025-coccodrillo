Musée Tomi Ungerer | Strasbourg, France |  A tribute to one of Strasbourg’s most famous sons – award-winning illustrator and cartoonist Tomi Ungerer – this museum, just northeast of Grande Île, is housed in the fetching Villa Greiner. The collection discloses the artist’s love of dabbling in many genres, from children’s-book illustrations to satirical drawings and erotica.
