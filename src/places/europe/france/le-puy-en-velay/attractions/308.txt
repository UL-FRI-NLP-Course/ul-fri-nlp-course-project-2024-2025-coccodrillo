Cath√©drale Notre Dame Cloister | Auvergne, France |  A peaceful 12th-century cloister adjoins Le Puy's cathedral, its multicoloured bricks and columns alluding to strong Moorish influences. Upstairs is a fine collection of embroidered religious artwork and vestments, accompanied by absorbing audiovisual displays about their origins.
