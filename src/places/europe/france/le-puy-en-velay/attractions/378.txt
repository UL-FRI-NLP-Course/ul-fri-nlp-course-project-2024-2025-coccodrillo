Nimble-fingered travellers can sign up for lace-making classes (from €18 per hour, book in advance). There's an adjoining shop filled with pretty souvenirs and books.
Le Puy bloomed into a lace-making centre thanks to its role as a pilgrimage hub. The need for lace-trimmed religious clothing created an industry of nearly 5000 lace workshops around the region, though only a handful remain today.Le Puy's lace centre is also HQ for correspondence courses in lace-making, which are pursued by handicrafts devotees across the globe.
