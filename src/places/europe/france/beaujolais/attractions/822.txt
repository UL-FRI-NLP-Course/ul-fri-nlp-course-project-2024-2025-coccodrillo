La Maison du Terroir Beaujolais | Lyon & the Rhône Valley, France |  This exhibition space has a series of rooms with audiovisual displays that highlight the wine, food and culture of the Beaujolais. If you'd rather not visit the galleries, it's worth exploring the shop, which is packed with gourmet regional foodstuffs, including cheeses, jams, charcuterie and, of course, Beaujolais wine. Also rents bikes (half-/full day €14/19).
