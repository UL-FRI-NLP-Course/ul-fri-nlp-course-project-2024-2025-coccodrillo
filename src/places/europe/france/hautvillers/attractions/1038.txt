Église Abbatiale | Champagne, France |  Part of a former Benedictine abbey, the Abbaye St-Pierre d'Hautvillers, founded in AD 650 by St Nivard, bishop of Reims, this church is liberally decorated with 17th-century woodwork. This is where the good monk Dom Pérignon is buried. Note the tomb in front of the altar.
