Musée Le Secq des Tournelles | Rouen, France |  Home to one of the world’s premier collections of wrought iron, this riveting (excuse the pun) museum is an astonishing sight, showcasing the extraordinary skills of pre-industrial iron- and locksmiths, in a magnificent setting across two floors within a desanctified 16th-century church.There's everything from elaborate penknives to candle snuffs, beds, fortified chests, candelabra, miniature pistols and intricate keys.
