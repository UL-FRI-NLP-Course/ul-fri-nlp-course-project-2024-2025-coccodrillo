Abbatiale St-Ouen | Rouen, France |  This largely empty 14th-century abbey is a gloriously sublime and quite stunning example of the Rayonnant Gothic style, with a colossal interior dappled with the light from the gorgeous stained glass; it's quite a mind-blowing spectacle. The entrance is through the lovely garden on the south side, facing rue des Faulx.
