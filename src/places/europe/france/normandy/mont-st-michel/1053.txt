Moulin de Moidrey | Mont St-Michel, France |  Situated up on a hill, this old working windmill dates to the early 19th century and is quite a picture on the way to Mont St-Michel. You can buy flour, cider and wheat on the ground floor of the mill. It's free to enter, but there's a price for the guided tour.
