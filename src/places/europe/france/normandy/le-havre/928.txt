Cath√©drale Notre-Dame | Le Havre, France |  When Le Havre's concrete expanses and straight lines overpower you, stop by this lovely Baroque church, which somehow eluded the intense bombing efforts of the Royal Air Force. The cathedral originally dates to the early 16th century and is the oldest building in the centre of town; the interior is a repository of calm.
