Abbaye de Paimpont | Brittany, France |  Scenically overlooking the waters of the Ã‰tang de Paimpont (Paimpont Pond), this splendid and tranquil abbey is a highlight of the region. The abbey replaced an earlier monastery on this site that dated to the 7th century; the current church dates to the 13th century, and was added to over succeeding centuries.
