Rue de la Boucherie | Limoges, France |  Pedestrianised rue de la Boucherie was named for the butchers’ shops that lined the street in the Middle Ages. Today it has many attractive medieval half-timbered houses, and the Maison de la Boucherie operates a small history museum. Tiny 1475 Chapelle St-Aurélien, dedicated to the patron saint of butchers, is maintained by the butchers’ guild.
