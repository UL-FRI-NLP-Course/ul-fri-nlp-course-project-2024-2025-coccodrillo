Crypt of St Martial | Limoges, France |  All that remains of the once-great pilgrimage point St-Martial abbey, founded in AD 848, is a faint outline on place de la République, and an underground tomb dedicated to the city’s patron saint. The crypt was undergoing renovations at the time of research and will feature a new archaeological centre in the future. Check with tourist office for updates on access to the site.
