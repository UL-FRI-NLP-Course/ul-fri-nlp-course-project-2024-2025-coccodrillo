Place du Forum | Arles, France |  Just as social, political and religious life revolved around the forum in Roman Arles, so the busy plane-tree-shaded place du Forum still buzzes with life. Underneath it lies the underground galleries of Cryptoportiques â€“ the forum's subterranean foundations and buried arcades (89m long and 59m wide). These caverns were carved out in the 1st century BC.
