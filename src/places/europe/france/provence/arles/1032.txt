Espace Van Gogh | Arles, France |  The 16th-century hospital where Van Gogh had his ear stitched on and was later locked up hosts the occasional exhibition (which attracts an entry fee). At other times, its small courtyard garden, modelled on Van Gogh's Le Jardin de l'HÃ´tel de Dieu, is worth a peek.
