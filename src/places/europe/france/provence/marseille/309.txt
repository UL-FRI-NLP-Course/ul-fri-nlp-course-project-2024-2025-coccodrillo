Jardin du Pharo | Marseille, France |  Perched high above the southern side of the Vieux Port are the six immaculately grassed hectares of the Jardin du Pharo, the grounds of the Palais du Pharo, which was commissioned by Napoleon III in 1852. With unparalleled views over old Marseille, the gardens are a perfect picnic spot and ideal for watching sunsets.
