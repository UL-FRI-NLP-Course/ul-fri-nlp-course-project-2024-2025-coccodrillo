Vallon des Auffes | Marseille, France |  Nestled around this picture-postcard fishing village, a remnant of old maritime Marseille long since swallowed by modern sprawl, are traditional cabanons (seaside cabins), built by fishermen to store tackle and cook traditional Sunday bouillabaisse. A narrow staircase (behind the bus stop) links corniche Pr√©sident John F Kennedy with the harbour.
