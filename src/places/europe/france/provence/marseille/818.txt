Fort St-Nicolas | Marseille, France |  Guarding the southern side of Marseilleâ€™s harbour (and threatening its sometimes rebellious citizens, who attempted to destroy it during the Revolution) is the star-shaped, 17th-century Fort St-Nicolas, built by Louis XIV. Used as both garrison and prison, it can only be visited by prior arrangement with the tourist office.
