Le Panier | Marseille, France |  'The Basket' is Marseille's oldest quarter – site of the original Greek settlement and nicknamed for its steep streets and buildings. Its close, village-like feel, artsy ambience, cool hidden squares and sun-baked cafes make it a delight to explore. Rebuilt after destruction in WWII, its mishmash of lanes hide artisan shops, ateliers (workshops) and terraced houses strung with drying washing. Its centrepiece is La Vieille Charité.
