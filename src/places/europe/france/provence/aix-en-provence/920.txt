Bastide du Jas de Bouffan | Aix-en-Provence, France |  In 1859 Cézanne’s father bought Le Jas de Bouffan, an 18th-century country manor west of Aix where Cézanne painted furiously, producing 36 oils and 17 watercolours depicting the house, farm, chestnut alley, green park and so forth. The manor was closed for renovation when we visited, and is expected to reopen in 2019.
