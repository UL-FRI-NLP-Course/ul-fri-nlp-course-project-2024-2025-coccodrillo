Musée de la Marine de Loire | The Loire Valley, France |  Well-presented exhibits tell the story of how a river that's basically non-navigable was used for commerce using ultra-shallow-draft (70cm) boats. Displays include a collection of model boats and ancient riverine artefacts. The ticket counter can supply you with an excellent museum guide in English. Occupies the former stables of the town’s park-encircled château, now the town hall.
