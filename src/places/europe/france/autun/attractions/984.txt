Temple de Janus | Burgundy, France |  Long associated (wrongly) with the Roman God Janus, this 24m-high temple in the middle of farmland 800m north of the train station is thought to have originally been a site for Celtic worship. It exudes an imposing, mysterious energy, despite the fact that only two of its massive walls still stand.
