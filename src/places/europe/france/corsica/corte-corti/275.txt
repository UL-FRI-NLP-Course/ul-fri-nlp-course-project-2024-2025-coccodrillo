Belvédère | Corte, Corsica |  Perched on a south-facing promontory immediately below the citadel, and reached via a signposted staircase just outside the ramparts, this free-access viewing platform gives stunning views across Corte to the mountains, and up to the citadel.
It’s also the starting point for a steep but enjoyable 2km footpath, the Sentier du Patrimoine, which loops down to the Tavignanu River, crosses the town’s oldest bridge, and climbs back to the centre.
