Citadel | Ajaccio, Corsica |  Constructed on the rocky headland during the 16th century, the imposing military fortress that adjoins old Ajaccio still belongs to the army. It has been vacant for years, but remains off limits to visitors, so you can only admire its stout walls and deep grassy moat from outside.
