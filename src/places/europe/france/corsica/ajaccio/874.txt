Cathédrale Ste-Marie | Ajaccio, Corsica |  Surprisingly small but in a commanding position facing out to sea, Ajaccio’s ochre-coloured cathedral dates from the 16th century. As well as a depiction of the Virgin of the Sacred Heart by Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), it claims to contain Napoléon’s baptismal font, though some historians dispute that he was baptised here at all.
