Promenade de la Marinella | Corsica, France |  This coastal promenade follows the seafront east from ÃŽle Rousse. The beach right by the town centre is actually very pleasant, with fine broad sand, but inevitably it can get very crowded in summer. More peaceful beaches nearby include Plage de Bodri, immediately southwest; Algajola, 8km southwest; and the magnificent Plage de Lozari, 8km east.
