Cascade des Anglais | Corsica, France |  A short, gentle and well-signed path, which leaves the T20 2.5km southwest of Vizzavona station, meanders down through a superb forest to reach this long sequence of gleaming waterfalls. Interspersed with shallow pools that are wonderful for splashing in on hot summer days, it's hugely popular with daytripping families.
