Atelier Renoir | Champagne, France |  The Atelier Renoir has displays zooming in on the hallmarks of Renoirâ€™s work (the female form, the vibrant use of colour and light), alongside original pieces such as his antiquated wheelchair and the box he used to carry his paintings to Paris. Perhaps loveliest of all is the studio garden, particularly in spring to early summer when it bursts forth with tulips, anemones and roses.
