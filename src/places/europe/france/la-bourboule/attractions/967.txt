Église St-Joseph | Parc Naturel Régional des Volcans d'Auvergne, France |  La Bourboule's pale lava-stone church, completed in 1888, cuts an elegant silhouette against its mountainous backdrop.
Modelled after Orcival's impressive basilica, Église St-Joseph follows a similar Romanesque style but the carvings capping its interior columns only date from the mid-20th century.
