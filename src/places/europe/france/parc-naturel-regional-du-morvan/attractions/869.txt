Maison des Hommes et des Paysages | Burgundy, France |  This thoughtfully organised museum invites visitors to contemplate the interplay between humans and the Morvan's landscapes over the centuries. Exhibits include a room-sized maquette of the park and the Salle des Panoramas, where touchscreens offer a chance to scan through photos of the region past and present. Displays are mainly in French.
