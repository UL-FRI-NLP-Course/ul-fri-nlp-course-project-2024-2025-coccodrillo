Plage Cros deï Pin | Côte d'Azur, France |  At the north end of St-Jean village, just off the trail to Beaulieu-sur-Mer, this was the peninsula's original public beach. It remains popular with locals for swimming and for its family-friendly facilities, including a playground, a beach volleyball court and a reasonably priced snack bar.
