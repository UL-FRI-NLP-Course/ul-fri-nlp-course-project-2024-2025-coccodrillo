Plage Paloma | CÃ´te d'Azur, France |  A dreamy spot for swimming, sunbathing and water sports of all kinds, this secluded crescent of sand 1km east of St-Jean has an iconic bar-restaurant, unbeatable coastal views and a full lineup of rental equipment on offer (water skiing, kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding etc). Over the years it's been frequented by the likes of Winston Churchill, Sean Connery, Elton John and Pablo Picasso; the latter regularly brought his youngest daughter here, hence the name.
