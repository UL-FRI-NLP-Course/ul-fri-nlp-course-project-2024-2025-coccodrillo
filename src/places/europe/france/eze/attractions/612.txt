Fort de la Revère | Èze, France |  Sitting just above Èze, this fort is the perfect place to revel in 360-degree views. An orientation table helps you get your bearings. The fort was built in 1870 to protect Nice (it served as an allied prisoner camp during WWII). There are picnic tables under the trees for an al fresco lunch and dozens of trails in the surrounding Parc Naturel Départemental de la Grande Corniche, a protected area that stretches along the D2564 from Col d’Èze to La Turbie.
