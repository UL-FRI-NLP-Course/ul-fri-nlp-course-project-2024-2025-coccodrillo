Cathédrale St-Front | The Dordogne, France |  Périgueux’ most distinctive landmark is most notable for its five creamy Byzantine tower-topped domes (inspired by either St Mark’s Basilica in Venice or the church of the Holy Apostles of Constantinople, depending on whom you ask). Built in the 12th century on the site of two earlier basilicas, it was sacked in the Wars of Religion, and redesigned and rebuilt by Abadie (the architect of Paris’ Sacré Cœur) in the late 19th century.
A striking bell tower remains from the 12th-century church, and informed the design of Abadie’s domes. The interior is laid out in a Greek cross, and the cloisters date from the 12th to 16th centuries.The best views of the cathedral are from Pont des Barris just to the east.
