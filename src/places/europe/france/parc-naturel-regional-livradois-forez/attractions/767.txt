Ã‰glise St-Jean | Auvergne, France |  A blushing sandstone church in Glaine-Montaigut, 20km southwest of Thiers, makes a worthwhile detour. The Romanesque church's interior, brightly coloured with stripes and fleur-de-lys designs, has been nicely restored. Look out for griffins and centaurs peeping out from its carved capitals. If it isn't open, enquire at Auberge de la Forge opposite.
