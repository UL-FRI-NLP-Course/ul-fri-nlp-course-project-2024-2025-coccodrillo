Château du Grimaud | Côte d'Azur, France |  Built over an 11th-century predecessor in the 13th, and extended in the 15th, this chateau was destroyed during the Wars of Religion (1562–98). Rebuilt in the 17th century, it was wrecked again during the French Revolution, leaving the picturesque shell that surmounts the town today.
