Cathédrale St-Just | Languedoc-Roussillon, France |  Narbonne’s most distinctive landmark is actually only half-finished: construction was halted in the 14th century, and only the towers and choir reached final completion. Its treasury has a beautiful Flemish tapestry of the Creation, while grotesque gargoyles leer down upon the 16th-century cloister.
