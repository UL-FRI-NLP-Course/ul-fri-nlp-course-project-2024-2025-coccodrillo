Musée de la Résistance | Clermont-Ferrand, France |  In a simple, schoolroom format, this small museum details the chronology of events following 21 June 1940, when Nazi troops marched into Clermont-Ferrand. Located 1km west of central Clermont in Chamalières, which was the seat of the Clermont Gestapo at the time, the museum remembers Resistance fighters (and French collaborators) and features apparatus of the era such as a printing press.
