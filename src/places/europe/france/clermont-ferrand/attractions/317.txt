Place de Jaude | Clermont-Ferrand, France |  Just southwest of the old city, lined with bars and hotels, Clermont-Ferrand's monumental pedestrianised square is overlooked by a statue of heroic Celtic chief Vercingétorix.
The statue was created by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, who also designed the Statue of Liberty.
