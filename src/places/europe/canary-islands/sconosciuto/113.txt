Cuatro Puertas | Gran Canaria, Spain |  Although it's only 5km south of Telde, this impressive pre-Hispanic site is seldom visited, even by locals. 'Cuatro Puertas' means 'four doors' and takes its name from the multiple entrances carved into the rock face of this human-made cave complex. There are information panels here but no visitors centre, meaning you can visit whenever you like. It's just off the GC-100 in the minute hamlet of Cuatro Puertas. Bus 36 from Telde (â‚¬1.40, 10 minutes) passes by hourly en route to Maspalomas.
