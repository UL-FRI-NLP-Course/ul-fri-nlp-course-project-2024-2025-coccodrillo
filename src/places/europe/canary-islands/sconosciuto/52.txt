Piscinas de Punta Mujeres | Lanzarote, Spain |  One of the most magical swimming spots on Lanzarote, this cluster of glittering turquoise natural pools dots the coast in the tranquil whitewashed fishing village of Punta Mujeres, 2km northeast of Arrieta. A few ladders provide access to the pools, overlooked by sun-soaking spots.
A wonderful tapas bar, La Piscina, overlooks one of the most popular pools.
