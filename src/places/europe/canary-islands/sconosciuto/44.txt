Centro de Interpretación | Gran Canaria, Spain |  Occupying a cave at the entrance of the barranco, this large and excellent museum has very informative exhibits explaining the ravine's geology, fauna and flora and its fascinating history, from the pre-Hispanic inhabitants to the troglodytes of today. Discover how there are two species of plant – kunkeliella canariensis and parolinia platypetala – that exist in the Barranco de Guayadeque but nowhere else on earth.
