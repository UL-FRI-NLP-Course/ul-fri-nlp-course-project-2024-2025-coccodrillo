Jardín Botánico | Puerto de la Cruz, Spain |  Established in 1788, this magnificent botanical garden has thousands of plant varieties from all over the world and is a delightful place to while away an afternoon smelling the roses. As well as the major collections of tropical and subtropical plants, there's a wide variety of palms, a fragrant herb garden and a giant 200-year-old Australian Moreton Bay fig.
The garden is well signposted if you are driving. Alternatively, the majority of interurban buses make a stop near here on their way out of town, or a taxi will cost around €8.
