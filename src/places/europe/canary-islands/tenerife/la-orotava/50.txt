Casa de los Balcones | North Coast Tenerife, Spain |  This ornate mansion, dating to 1632, has a sublime setting, with balconies set around a picturesque central courtyard and also decorating the front of the building. An upstairs museum is dedicated to historical items that recreate how the house would have looked, while another room is devoted to lacework. Bypass the Chinese imports to admire the fine local needlework; there may well be a demonstration taking place.
