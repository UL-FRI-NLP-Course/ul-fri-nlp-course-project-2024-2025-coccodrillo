Auditorio de Tenerife | Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain |  This magnificent, soaring white wave of an auditorium was designed by the internationally renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, and delivers shades of the Sydney Opera House, plus superb acoustics. Guided 45-minute tours (â‚¬7.50; reserved in advance by telephone) in English, German or Spanish take you behind the scenes of the remarkable building.
If you don't have time for a tour or to attend a performance, at least consider having a drink in the cafe within the sweeping space of the main entrance. You can also walk around the entirety of the building and take plenty of arty photos to impress the folks and friends back home.
