Calle San Agustín | La Laguna, Spain |  To see the largest number of splendid mansions standing cheek to jowl, wander along Calle San Agustín. Look for the metal plaques outside the noble facades; they have fascinating historical explanations about the buildings (in Spanish and English). Several of the buildings have been turned into offices (generally located around a grand central courtyard), which you can take a peek at.
