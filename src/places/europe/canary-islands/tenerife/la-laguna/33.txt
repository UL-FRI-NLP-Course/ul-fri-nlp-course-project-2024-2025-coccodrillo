Museo de la Historia de Tenerife | La Laguna, Spain |  The documents, maps, weapons and tools are interesting enough at this museum, but the 16th-century mansion – with its creaking floorboards, old window seats, elaborately carved wooden gallery and lovely patio – of Casa Lercaro is simply lovely. Don't miss the two magnificent 18th- and 19th-century carriages kept in a separate exhibition space at the rear of the museum (open noon to 3pm). The museum is free to visit on Fridays and Saturdays from 4pm.
