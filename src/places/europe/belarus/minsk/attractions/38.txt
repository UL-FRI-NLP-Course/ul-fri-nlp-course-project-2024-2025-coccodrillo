Zaslavsky Jewish Monument | Minsk, Belarus |  This extremely moving sight, rather hidden away in a sunken gully amid trees off vul Melnikayte, commemorates the savage murder of 5000 Jews from Minsk at the hands of the Nazis on 2 March 1942. It is made up of sculptures of scared men, women and children lining up to be shot, one person even carrying their violin.
