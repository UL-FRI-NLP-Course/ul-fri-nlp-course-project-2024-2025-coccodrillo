Kastrychnitskaya Pl | Minsk, Belarus |  The city's main square is referred to universally by its Russian name, Oktyabrskaya Ploshchad (October Sq). Here you'll find the impressive, severe Palats Respubliki (Palace of the Republic), a concert hall. Also on this square is the classical, multicolumned Stalinist Empireâ€“style Trade Union Palace of Culture.
This is where opposition groups gather to protest against President Alexander Lukashenko from time to time; it's also where the infamous 2010 presidential election protests ended in violence. The failed Denim Revolution of March 2006 was attempted here as well.
