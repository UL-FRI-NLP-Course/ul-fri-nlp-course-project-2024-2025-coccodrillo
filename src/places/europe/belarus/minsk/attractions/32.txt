Trinity Hill | Minsk, Belarus |  Trinity Hill is a pleasant – if tiny – recreation of Minsk's pre-war buildings on a pretty bend of the river just a little north of the centre. It has a few little cafes, restaurants and shops, and a walking bridge leads over to the Island of Courage & Sorrow, an evocative Afghan war memorial known locally as the Island of Tears.
