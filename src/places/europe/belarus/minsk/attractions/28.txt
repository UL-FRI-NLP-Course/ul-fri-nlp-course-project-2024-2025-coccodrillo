Pl Svabody | Minsk, Belarus |  In the heart of the Old Town just off central vul Lenina is charming pl Svabody, lorded over by the white medieval Ratusha (town hall). Off the northern edge of the square is the baroque, twin-towered Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, built in 1642. It was once part of a Polish Bernardine convent, along with the former Bernardine Church next door, which now houses city archives.
