National History Museum | Minsk, Belarus |  Two freshly modernised museums in one here. The national history museum proper occupies the upper floors with exhibits of ethnographic and archaeological significance, including a replica of the printing press used by national hero Francyska Skaryny and some rooms on Soviet life. Downstairs, the nature and environment museum will be mostly of interest to kids with its collection of stuffed animals. There's also a large space for temporary art exhibits.
