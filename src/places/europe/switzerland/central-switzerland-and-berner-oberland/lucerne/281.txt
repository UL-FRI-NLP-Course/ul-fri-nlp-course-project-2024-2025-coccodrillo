Männliturm | Lucerne, Switzerland |  West along the old city walls and not connected to the ramparts walkway, climb Männliturm for unobstructed views out over Lucerne and marvellous photo opportunities. The 33m-high tower got its name, meaning Little Man Tower, from the little iron man holding a flag that stands on its top and is known all over Switzerland.
