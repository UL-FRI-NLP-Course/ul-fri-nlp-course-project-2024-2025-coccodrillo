Old Town | Lucerne, Switzerland |  The medieval Old Town, with its ancient rampart walls and towers, 15th-century buildings with painted facades and two covered bridges, is fascinating. Kapellbrücke, dating from 1333, is Lucerne’s best-known landmark. It’s famous for its distinctive water tower and the spectacular 1993 fire that nearly destroyed it. Look for the 17th-century pictorial panels under the roof. The Dance of Death panels under the roofline of Spreuerbrücke are a tad dark and dour.
