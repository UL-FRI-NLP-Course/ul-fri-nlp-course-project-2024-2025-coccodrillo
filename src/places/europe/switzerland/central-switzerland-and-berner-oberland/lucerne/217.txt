Gletschergarten | Lucerne, Switzerland |  The Gletschergarten houses a strip of rock bearing the scars (including huge potholes) inflicted on it by the glacier that slid over it some 20 million years ago. Kids of all ages and devotees of kitsch will love getting lost in the Thousand and One Nights–style mirror maze inspired by Spain’s Alhambra Palace. It's next door to the Lion Monument.
