Schloss Thun | Bernese Oberland, Switzerland |  Sitting on a hilltop and looking proudly back on 900 years of history, Schloss Thun is the castle of your wildest fairy-tale dreams, crowned by a riot of turrets and affording tremendous views of the lake and Alps. It once belonged to Duke Berchtold V of the powerful ZÃ¤hringen family. Today it houses a museum, showcasing prehistoric and Roman relics, tapestries, majolica and plenty of shining armour.
