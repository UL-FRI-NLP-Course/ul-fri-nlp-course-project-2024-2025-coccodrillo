Mus√©e et Chiens du Saint-Bernard | Valais, Switzerland |  A tribute to the lovably dopey St Bernard, this museum next to Martigny's Roman amphitheatre includes real-life fluff bundles in the kennels. You can join the dogs for walks at various locations year-round; check the website for details and reserve in advance. Upstairs an exhibition traces the role of St Bernards in hospice life, on canvas and in film. There are puppy- and dog-feeding sessions and hourly times for petting and taking photographs.
