Niederdorf | Zürich, Switzerland |  On the Limmat River’s east bank, the winding cobbled streets of Niederdorf are crammed with restaurants, bars, galleries, bookshops and craft shops. Affectionately dubbed 'Dörfli' by locals, the quarter has a laid-back vibe. Climb up from the river to Lindenhof for postcard views of the Old Town.
