Ethnographic Museum | Zürich, Switzerland |  The University of Zürich's Ethnographic Museum hosts two regularly changing temporary exhibitions on non-European cultures, and offers insight into its topics of research – for example, you can discover how Prince Vessantara became Buddha, or find out how the museum works with international partners in order to examine other societies in a sensitive way.
