Gemsstock | Central Switzerland, Switzerland |  This 2961m mountain, reached by cable car, attracts hikers in summer and skiers coming for the snow-sure slopes in winter. The region is also beloved of off-piste skiers seeking fresh powder. This has become part of the Ski Arena conglomeration, so check its website for details. Toboggan runs, well-prepared walking trails and sleigh rides appeal to non-skiers in winter.
