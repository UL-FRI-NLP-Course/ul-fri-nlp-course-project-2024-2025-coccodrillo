Robiei Dam | Ticino, Switzerland |  At the end of the Val Bavona, just after San Carlo, a cable car rides up to Robiei dam and its startlingly turquoise reservoir, tailor-made for a dayâ€™s mountain hiking. A trail also takes you deep into the dam for an insight into its construction and hydroelectric power. If it is closed, ask for the key at the Albergo-Ristorante Robiei.
