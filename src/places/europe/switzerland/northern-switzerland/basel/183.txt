Lällekönig | Basel, Switzerland |  You'll find this replica of the 15th-century animated bust of the Lällekönig (Tongue King) on the Grossbasel side of the Mittlere Brücke, sticking his tongue out and rolling his eyes at the 'lowly' residents of Kleinbasel over the other side – actions that neatly sum up the historical attitude between the two sides of town. The original is housed in the Museum für Geschichte.
