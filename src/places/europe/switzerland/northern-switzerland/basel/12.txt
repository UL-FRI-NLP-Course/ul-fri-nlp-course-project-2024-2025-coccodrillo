Fondation Beyeler | Basel, Switzerland |  This astounding private-turned-public collection, assembled by former art dealers Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, is housed in a long, low, light-filled, open-plan building designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano. The varied exhibits juxtapose 19th- and 20th-century works by Picasso and Rothko against sculptures by Miró and Max Ernst and tribal figures from Oceania; there are also regular visiting exhibitions. Take tram 6 to Riehen from Barfüsserplatz or Marktplatz.
A great way to visit the museum is to make a day of it and walk the '24 stops' Rehberger-Weg between Fondation Beyeler and the Vitra Campus.
