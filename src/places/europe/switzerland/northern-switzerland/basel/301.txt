Zentralstellwerk | Basel, Switzerland |  You have to love the Swiss for enlisting some of the world's best-known architects, albeit homegrown ones (Herzog & de Meuron), to design something as rudimentary as a railway signal box. The copper cladding of this hulking structure, completed in 1999, is unmissable when arriving at SBB Basel station.
