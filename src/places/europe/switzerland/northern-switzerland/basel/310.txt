Schweizerisches Museum f√ºr Papier, Schrift und Druck | Basel, Switzerland |  Set in an old paper mill astride a medieval canal and complete with a functioning waterwheel, the Paper Museum evokes centuries past, when a dozen mills operated nearby. This one produced paper for centuries and the museum explores that story. Just to the east stands a stretch of the old city wall.
