Els√§ssertor | Basel, Switzerland |  Designed by world-renowned Basel architects Herzog & de Meuron, this angular glass commercial building (its name means 'Alsace Gate') was completed in 2004. Although its shape doesn't seem unusual now, it was a cutting-edge design at the time of its inception. Three of its glass faces are coloured red, white and blue in tribute to Basel's French neighbours.
