Museo di Castelgrande | Ticino, Switzerland |  This museum has a modest collection of finds from Castelgrande's hill dating to prehistoric times. More engaging are the 15th-century ceiling decorations of a former noble house in central Bellinzona. The pictures range from weird animals to a humorous 'world upside downâ€™ series that includes an ox driving a human-pulled plough and a sex-crazed woman chasing a chaste man!
