Ricola Herb Garden | Zermatt, Switzerland |  Best known for its herby hard-boiled sweets, Ricola has a short herb-garden hike at Blatten where you can learn about the 13 herbs that go into every drop. Blatten is about halfway down the Matterhorn Express cable car between FÃ¼ri and Zermatt, reached by walking track. The start of the herb-garden walk is next to the small chapel.
