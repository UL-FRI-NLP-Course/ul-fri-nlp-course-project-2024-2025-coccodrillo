Triftbrücke | Bernese Oberland, Switzerland |  The Hasli Valley is laced with 300km of signposted walking trails. A huge hit is this 170m-long, 100m-high suspension bridge, Europe’s longest and highest. To reach the bridge from Meiringen, take a train to Innertkirchen, then a bus to Nessental, Triftbahn. Here a cable car takes you up to 1022m, from where it’s a 1½- to two-hour walk to the bridge (1870m).
Hikers come to balance above the majestic Trift glacier, as it becomes meltwater more swiftly than it once did.
