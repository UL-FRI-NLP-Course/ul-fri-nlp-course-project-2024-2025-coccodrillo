Aareschlucht | Bernese Oberland, Switzerland |  Less than 2km from Meiringen is the narrow, 1.4km-long Aare Gorge, where tunnels and galleries lead past milky-blue torrents and limestone overhangs. The canyon is spectacularly illuminated on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings in summer. To make your way here, take the Meiringen-Innertkirchen-Bahn train.
