Klostermuseum St Georgen | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  This monastery museum sits between the Rathaus and the Rhine. A Benedictine monastery was built here in 1007, but what you see today, including the cloister and the magnificent Festsaal (grand dining room), is largely a late-Gothic creation.
