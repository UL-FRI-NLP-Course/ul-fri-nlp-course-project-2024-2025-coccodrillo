Fontaine de la Justice | Lausanne, Switzerland |  Sculpted by Laurent Perroud between 1584 and 1585, this striking fountain features a statue of a blindfolded woman bearing a sword and scales with four men bowing at her feet (this one is a 1930 copy of the original, now housed in the Mus√©e Historique de Lausanne).
