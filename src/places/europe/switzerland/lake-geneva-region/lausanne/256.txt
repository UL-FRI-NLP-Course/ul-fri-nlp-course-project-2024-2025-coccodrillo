Musée Historique de Lausanne | Lausanne, Switzerland |  Until the 15th century, the city’s bishops resided in this lovely manor across from the cathedral (after which it became a jail, then a court, then a hospital). Since 1918 it has devoted itself to evoking Lausanne’s heritage through paintings, drawings, stamps, musical instruments, silverware and so on. Don’t miss the film featuring Lausanne in 1638.
