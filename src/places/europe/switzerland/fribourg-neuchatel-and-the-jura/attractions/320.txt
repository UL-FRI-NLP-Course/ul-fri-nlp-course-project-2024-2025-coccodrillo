Basilique de Notre-Dame de Fribourg | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  The highlight of this church is an 18th-century Cr√®che Napolitaine featuring 75 figurines re-enacting the nativity, annunciation and scenes from daily life. Push your way through the heavy grey drapes and drop a one/two-franc coin into the slot to view the crib for four/eight minutes.
