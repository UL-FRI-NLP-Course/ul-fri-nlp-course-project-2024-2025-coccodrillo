Caumasee | Graubünden, Switzerland |  Ringed by thick woods, this exquisitely turquoise lake is a 15-minute stroll and then short lift ride south of Flims Waldhaus. It's an attractive spot for a cool summer swim. You can hire a rowboat and eat at a restaurant terrace overlooking the lake. It's known as ‘Lag la Cauma’ in Romansh, meaning Lake Siesta.
