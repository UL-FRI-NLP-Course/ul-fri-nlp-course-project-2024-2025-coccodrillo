Zinal | Valais, Switzerland |  At 1670m, Zinal is 12km south of Vissoie, at the end of the Val dâ€™Anniviers. While Matterhorn climbers start from Zermatt, a valley to the east, climbers for five other 4000+m peaks seen from the Zermatt side, start their climbs from Zinal. This is a grand base for both summer and winter sports. The ski area is interconnected with that of Grimentz and the village has a number of hotels which also boast restaurants and bars.
