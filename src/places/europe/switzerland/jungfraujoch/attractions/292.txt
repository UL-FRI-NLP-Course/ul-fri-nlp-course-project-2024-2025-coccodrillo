Ice Palace | Bernese Oberland, Switzerland |  Tunnels of ice polished as smooth as cut glass lead through the so-called Ice Palace at Jungfraujoch, which offers a frosty reception at minus 3Â°C. Mountain guides wielding saws and pick axes carved the chambers out of solid ice in the 1930s. Now they are adorned with frozen sculptures of bears, ibexes and eagles.
