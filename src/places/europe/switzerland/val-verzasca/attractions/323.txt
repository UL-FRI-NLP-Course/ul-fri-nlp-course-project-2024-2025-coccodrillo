Sonogno | Ticino, Switzerland |  A once-abandoned hamlet at the head of the valley, Sonogo is enveloped by chestnut and beech woods. Its pocket-sized centre is an adorable collection of granite houses, swaddled with vines and flowers, and dwarfed totally by the scale of the rugged mountains that rise above it.
