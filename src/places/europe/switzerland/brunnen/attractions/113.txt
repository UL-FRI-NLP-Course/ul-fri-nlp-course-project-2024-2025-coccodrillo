Swiss Knife Valley Museum | Central Switzerland, Switzerland |  This teensy museum displays historical knives from prehistoric, Roman and medieval times, including folding precursors to the Victorinox classic. Touch-screen films in four languages chart the history of knives in general and Victorinox specifically. But the real highlight is the 'build-your-own-knife' section: for Sfr30 staff will help you construct your own souvenir Victorinox (ages six and over; reserve in advance).
