Rasa | Ticino, Switzerland |  Redolent of a more peaceful bygone age, Rasa is an utterly charming stone village, clinging to high slopes, combed through with neatly tended vegetable gardens and topped off with a campanile. There's little to detain you in the way of actual attractions, but linger for a snapshot into local life and stirring views of the mountains that crumple the horizon. Walking trails fan out in all directions.
