Textilmuseum | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  St Gallen has long been an important hub of the Swiss textile industry, and this museum pays homage to that tradition. The collection brings together many centuries of textiles from all over the world – from fabrics taken from ancient Egyptian graves to medieval embroidery and impossibly intricate lace – and the machinery used to produce them. Check the website to see which temporary exhibitions are showing.
