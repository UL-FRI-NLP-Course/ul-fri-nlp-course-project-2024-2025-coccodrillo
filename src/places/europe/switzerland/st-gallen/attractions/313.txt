Stadtlounge | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  Quite astonishingly, part of historic St Gallen is covered by a rubberised red tennis-court coating, with in-situ outdoor-furniture-like chairs, sofas and tables – even a car. This zany art-installation project by Pipilotti Rist and Carlos Martínez is intended as an ‘outdoor living room’.
