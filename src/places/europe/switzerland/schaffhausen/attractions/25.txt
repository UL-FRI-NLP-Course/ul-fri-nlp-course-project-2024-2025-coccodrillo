Allerheiligen Münster | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  Completed in 1103, Schaffhausen’s cathedral is a rare, largely intact specimen of the Romanesque style in Switzerland. It opens to a beautifully simple cloister. The herb garden has been lovingly tended since the Middle Ages and is a tranquil spot for contemplation. Walk through the cloister to reach the Museum zu Allerheiligen for antiquities, artworks, and archaeological and natural history exhibitions.
