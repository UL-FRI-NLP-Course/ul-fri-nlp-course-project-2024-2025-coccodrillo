Fronwagplatz | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  At the very heart of the Altstadt lies this square, flanked by ornate facades. The 16th-century Mohrenbrunnen marks the northern end of the old marketplace, while at the southern end stands the Metzgerbrunnen, a William Tellâ€“type figure and a large clock tower. Facing the latter is the late-baroque Herrenstube, built in 1748, which was once the drinking hole of quaffing nobles.
