Château de Porrentruy | The Jura Mountains, Switzerland |  The Château de Porrentruy, with its 44m-tall Tour de Réfous, dominates the little village. The oldest part of the castle complex began its life in the 13th century. The castle is now occupied by offices, so you can't go in, but you're free to walk around the inner courtyard for a closer look and fine views over the town.
