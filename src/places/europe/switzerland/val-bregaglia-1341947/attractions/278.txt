Palazzo Castelmur | Graub√ºnden, Switzerland |  Originally built in 1723, this castle was later renovated in 1854, giving it an intriguing mix of both Moorish and Gothic styles. It's surprising architecture is easy to spot from the main road. The museum has information on the valley's history, including a photography collection and houses the valley's historical archives.
