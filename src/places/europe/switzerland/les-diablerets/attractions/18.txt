Peak Walk by Tissot | Lake Geneva & Vaud, Switzerland |  On clear days the views from this world-first peak-to-peak footbridge are heaven-sent; think legendary Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn, plus Eiger, MÃ¶nch and Jungfrau. The 107m-long walk, between View Point Peak (2965m) and Scex Rouge (2971m), culminates with a spacious viewing platform and viewfinders complete with mountain names and altitudes, making it a must for lovers of the high life and not for those with vertigo or a fear of heights!
Take the cable car from Col du Pillon in Les Diablerets up to Glacier 3000.
