Schillerstein | Central Switzerland, Switzerland |  West across Lake Uri from Brunnen, youâ€™ll glimpse a near 30m-high natural obelisk, the Schillerstein, protruding from the water. Its gold inscription pays homage to Friedrich Schiller, the author of the play Wilhelm Tell, so instrumental in creating the Tell legend. The monument had a large inauguration ceremony in 1860.
