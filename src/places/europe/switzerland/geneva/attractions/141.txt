Quai du Mont-Blanc | Geneva, Switzerland |  Flowers, statues, outdoor art exhibitions and views of Mont Blanc (on clear days only) abound on this picturesque northern lakeshore promenade, which leads past the Bains des PÃ¢quis, where the Genevois have frolicked in the sun since 1872, to Parc de la Perle du Lac, a city park where Romans built ornate thermal baths. Further north, the peacock-studded lawns of Parc de l'Ariana ensnare the UN and Geneva's pretty Conservatoire et Jardin Botaniques.
