Cité du Temps | Geneva, Switzerland |  This 19th-century industrial building straddling Lake Geneva was constructed in the 1840s to provide the city's public fountains with water. Today it hosts temporary art exhibitions on its 1st floor and La Collection Swatch – the world's largest collection of the funky Swiss watches, dating from 1983 to the present – on its 2nd.
