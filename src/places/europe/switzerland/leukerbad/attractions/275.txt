Torrent-Bahnen | Valais, Switzerland |  The Torrent cable car carries winter skiers up to Rinderh√ºtte (2350m) from where a chairlift continues to 2610m. Downhill skiing is intermediate. In summer, tearing down the mountain on a monster scooter (adult/child Sfr15/12) is the way to go; count one hour for the steep, at times rocky, descent.
