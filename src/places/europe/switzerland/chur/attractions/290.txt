Obertor | Chur, Switzerland |  Near the Plessur River, the Obertor marks the entrance to Chur's alley-woven Altstadt. This four-storey building with an archway at the bottom, a leftover of medieval fortifications, narrows towards the top and fits in physically with the surrounding buildings, though it stands out due to its light exterior colour.
