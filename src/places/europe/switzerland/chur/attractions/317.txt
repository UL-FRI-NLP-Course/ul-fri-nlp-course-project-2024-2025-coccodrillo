Malteserturm | Chur, Switzerland |  Once the munitions tower (its previous name was Pulverturm meaning Gunpowder Tower), this is one of the few parts of the Old Town walls that were erected in the 13th century and still remain. It was the southwest corner of the fortifications and now marks one of the corners of the Old Town.
