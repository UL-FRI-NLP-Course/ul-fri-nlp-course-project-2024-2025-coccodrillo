Sankt Petersinsel | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  Political theorist Jean-Jacques Rousseau said he spent the happiest time of his life on this lovely island in the middle of the Bielersee, actually joined to the mainland by a long natural promontory. You can walk along it from the village of Erlach, or get here by catching a boat operated by BSG.
