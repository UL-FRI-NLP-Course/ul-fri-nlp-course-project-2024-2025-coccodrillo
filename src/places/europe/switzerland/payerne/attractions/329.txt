Mus√©e des Grenouilles | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  Estavayer-le-Lac's sweet 'frog museum' is a tribute to the town's obsession with our little green friends and is loved by adults and children alike for its collection of historical artefacts from all periods of the town's long history: it's not just all about the frogs.
