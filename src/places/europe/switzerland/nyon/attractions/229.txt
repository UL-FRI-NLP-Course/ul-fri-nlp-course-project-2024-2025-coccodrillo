Château de Coppet | Lake Geneva & Vaud, Switzerland |  This is the former home of Jacques Necker, Louis XVI’s banker and minister of finance, before it was handed down to his daughter, Madame de Staël, after she was exiled from Paris by Napoleon. It remains the little town of Coppet's crowning glory. Visitors can tour the rooms, sumptuously furnished in Louis XVI style, where de Staël entertained the likes of Edward Gibbon and Lord Byron.
