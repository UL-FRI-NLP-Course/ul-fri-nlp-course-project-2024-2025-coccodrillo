Aventicum | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  This collection of Roman ruins – the foundations of former structures, buildings and fortifications just outside Avenches' medieval Old Town – is best appreciated in conjunction with a visit to the Römermuseum Avenches and includes the incredible Arènes d'Avenches.
