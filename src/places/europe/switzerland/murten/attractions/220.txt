Ringmauer | Fribourg, Drei-Seen-Land and The Jura, Switzerland |  Ascend the wooden Aufstieg auf die Ringmauer (rampart stairs) behind the Deutsche Kirche to reach the covered walkway traversing these sturdy 11th-century city walls enclosing Murten's medieval Old Town. Itâ€™s magical at sunset to wander and imagine what life must have been like so many hundreds of years ago.
