Werdenberg | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  Blink and youâ€™ll miss this village and that would be a shame! Founded in 1289, it is said to be the oldest settlement of timber houses in Switzerland. The huddle of some 40-odd dwellings lies between an oversized pond and a grapevine-covered hill topped by a castle.An easy day trip from Appenzell, Werdenberg is a 40-minute drive south via the A13.
