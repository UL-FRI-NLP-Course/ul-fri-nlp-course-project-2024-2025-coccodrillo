Klosterkirche | Central Switzerland, Switzerland |  Follow the crowds flowing towards this baroque edifice, the 18th-century handiwork of Caspar Moosbrugger. The interior dances with colourful frescoes, stucco and gold swirls. Yet most pilgrims are oblivious to the marbled opulence, directing their prayers to the holiest of holies, the Black Madonna, a tiny statue in a chapel by the entrance.
