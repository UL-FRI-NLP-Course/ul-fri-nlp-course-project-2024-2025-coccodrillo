St Martin im Calfeisental | Northeastern Switzerland, Switzerland |  Located at 1350m, this stuck-in-time Walser-speaking hamlet is great for slipping off the map for a while, with its ludicrously picturesque cluster of timber huts, 14th-century chapel and watermill. It's totally dwarfed by the scale of its lake, mountain and forest backdrop. You can stay at the dark-wood chalet, the perfect base for a couple of daysâ€™ majestic walking.
