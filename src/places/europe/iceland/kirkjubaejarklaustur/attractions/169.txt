Systrastapi | Southeast Iceland, Iceland |  Religious connections are particularly strong around Klaustur. The prominent, stumpy rock pillar Systrastapi, near the line of cliffs about 1.5km west of town, marks the spot where two nuns were reputedly executed and buried for sleeping with the devil and other such no-nos.
