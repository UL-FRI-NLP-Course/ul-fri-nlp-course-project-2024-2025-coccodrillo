Kirkjugólf | Southeast Iceland, Iceland |  The basalt columns of Kirkjugólf (Church Floor), smoothed down and cemented with moss, were once mistaken for an old church floor rather than a work of nature, and it’s easy to see why. The honeycombed slab lies in a field about 400m northwest of the N1 petrol station; drive down Rte 203, where there’s a small parking area, access gate and sign.
