Diamond Beach | Southeast Iceland, Iceland |  At the Jökulsá river mouth you’ll see ice boulders and bergs resting photogenically on the black-sand beach as part of their final journey out to sea. Tourists have dubbed the site 'Diamond Beach', and the name has stuck.There are car parks on the ocean side of the Ring Road, on both sides of the bridge over the river.
