Saurbæjarkirkja | West Iceland, Iceland |  The church at the Saurbær farmstead is worth a look for its beautiful stained-glass work by Gerður Helgadóttir. It is named for Reverend Hallgrímur Pétursson, who served here from 1651 to 1669, and composed Iceland’s most popular religious work, Passion Hymns.
