Dómkirkja | Reykjavík, Iceland |  Iceland’s main cathedral, Dómkirkja is a modest affair, but it played a vital role in the country’s conversion to Lutheranism. The current building (built in the late 18th century and enlarged in the 1840s) is small and perfectly proportioned, with a plain wooden interior animated by glints of gold.
