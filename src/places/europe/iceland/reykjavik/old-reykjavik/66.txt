Ingibjörg H Bjarnason Statue | Reykjavík, Iceland |  Two things set the statue of Ingibjörg H Bjarnason apart from other monuments in the area: it depicts a historical female figure and it is not made by bronze-statue pioneer Einar Jónsson (it was made by Ragnhild Stefánsdóttir instead). Bjarnason, a teacher, was the first woman elected to Iceland’s parliament Alþingi in 1922, two years after Icelandic women gained the right to vote.
