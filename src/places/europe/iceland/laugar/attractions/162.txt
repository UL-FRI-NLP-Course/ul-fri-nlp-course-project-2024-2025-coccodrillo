Guðrúnarlaug | West Iceland, Iceland |  This hot pot with a view across the Dalir region is close to the original pool (now buried under a landslide) where the woman at the centre of the Laxardal Saga, Guðrún, 'the most beautiful woman ever to have grown up in Iceland', regularly took a dip. There's a small changing room.
