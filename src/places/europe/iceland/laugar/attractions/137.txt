Dalir Heritage Museum | West Iceland, Iceland |  This neat museum's curator is a wonderful character who knows a great deal about Dalir’s brilliant history, and if you make your way through the innumerable artefacts, there's an unexpected 1883 traditional baðstofa (living/sleeping room).
The museum is in the basement of the hotel.
