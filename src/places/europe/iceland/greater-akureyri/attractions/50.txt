Icelandic Folk & Outsider Art Museum | North Iceland, Iceland |  This excellent, eclectic museum 12km from Akureyri on Rte 1 (look for the sculpture of a tall blue man out the front) is a beautiful space filled with sunlight, plant life and an intriguing array of art through the ages (in Icelandic, its name literally means ‘the museum museum’). It has a sweet apartment for rent, too.
