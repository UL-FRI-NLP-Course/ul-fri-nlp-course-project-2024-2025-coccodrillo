Fagrifoss | Southeast Iceland, Iceland |  Fagrifoss (Beautiful Falls) is not a misnomer: this waterfall must be one of Iceland’s most bewitching, with rivulets of water pouring over a massive black rock. You’ll come to the turn-off on the way to Laki, about 24km along Rte F206. Tours to Lakagígar invariably stop here.
