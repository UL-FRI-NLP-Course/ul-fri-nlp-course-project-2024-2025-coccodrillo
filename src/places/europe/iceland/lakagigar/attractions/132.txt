Laki | Southeast Iceland, Iceland |  Although the peak called Laki (818m) did not erupt, it has loaned its name to the 25km-long Lakag√≠gar crater row, which stretches northeastwards and southwestwards from its base. Laki can be climbed in about 40 minutes from the parking area. From the top there are boundless 360-degree views of the fissure, vast lava fields and glinting glaciers in the distance.
