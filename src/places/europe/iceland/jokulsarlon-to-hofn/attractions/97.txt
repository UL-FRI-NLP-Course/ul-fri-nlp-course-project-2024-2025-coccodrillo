Flatey Farm | Southeast Iceland, Iceland |  The Flatey dairy farm (also known as Flatey á Mýrum) lies almost exactly halfway between Jökulsárlón and Höfn and is hard to miss as you drive along – the shed here is one of the largest structures you'll see in the region. Here you'll find a restaurant and a couple of tour companies making their summer base camp; namely IceGuide, Glacier Journey and Ice Explorers.
