Hoffellsjökull | Southeast Iceland, Iceland |  From the Hoffell guesthouse, a signed, 4km gravel road leads to Hoffellsjökull glacier tongue, calving into a small lake. There are some good short walks in the area, plus longer hikes (for experienced hikers) up the mountain Geitafell, just east of the glacier.This is a good glacier to walk to from the guesthouse; upon your return, you can soak in the hot-pots here.
