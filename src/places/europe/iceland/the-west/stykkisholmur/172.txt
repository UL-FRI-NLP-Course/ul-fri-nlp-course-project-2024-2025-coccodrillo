Volcano Museum | Snæfellsnes Peninsula, Iceland |  The Volcano Museum, housed in Stykkishólmur's old cinema, is the brainchild of vulcanologist Haraldur Sigurðsson, and features art depicting volcanoes, plus a small collection of interesting lava ('magma bombs') and artefacts from eruptions. A film screens upstairs.
