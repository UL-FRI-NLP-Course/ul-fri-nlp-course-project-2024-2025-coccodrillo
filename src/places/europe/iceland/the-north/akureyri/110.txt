Akureyri Museum | Akureyri, Iceland |  This sweet, well-curated museum houses art and historical items relating to town life, including maps, photos and recreations of early Icelandic homes. The museum garden became the first place in Iceland to cultivate trees when a nursery was established here in 1899. Next door is a tiny, black-tarred timber church dating from 1846.
A combined ticket including neighbouring Nonnah√∫s and several town museums costs 2000kr.
