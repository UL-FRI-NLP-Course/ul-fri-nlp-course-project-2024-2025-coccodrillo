Nonnahús | Akureyri, Iceland |  The most interesting of the artists’ residences in Akureyri, Nonnahús was the childhood home of renowned children’s writer Reverend Jón Sveinsson (1857–1944), known to most as Nonni. His old-fashioned tales of derring-do have a rich local flavour. The house dates from 1850; its cramped rooms and simple furnishings provide a poignant insight into life in 19th-century Iceland.
A combined ticket for Nonnahús, neighbouring Akureyri Museum and several town museums costs 2000kr.
