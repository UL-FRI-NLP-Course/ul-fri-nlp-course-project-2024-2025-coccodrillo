Húsavík Whale Museum | North Iceland, Iceland |  This excellent museum provides all you need to know about the impressive creatures that visit Skjálfandi bay. Housed in an old harbourside slaughterhouse, the museum interprets the ecology and habits of whales, conservation and the history of whaling in Iceland through beautifully curated displays, including several huge skeletons (they’re real) soaring high above and a mind-blowing blue whale skeleton.
