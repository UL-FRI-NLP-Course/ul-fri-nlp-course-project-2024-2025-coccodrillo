Húsavíkurkirkja | North Iceland, Iceland |  Húsavík’s beloved church is quite different from anything else seen in Iceland. Constructed in 1907 from Norwegian timber, the delicately proportioned red-and-white church would look more at home in the Alps. Its cruciform shape becomes apparent inside and is dominated by a depiction of the resurrection of Lazarus (made from lava) on the altarpiece. It's open most days in summer.
