Sjóminjasafnið | Snæfellsnes Peninsula, Iceland |  This small maritime museum houses Bliki, the oldest fishing boat in Iceland, and a cool replica of a fisher's turf house, plus loads of old photos and memorabilia. Look for the set of lifting stones once used to test the strength of prospective fishermen.
