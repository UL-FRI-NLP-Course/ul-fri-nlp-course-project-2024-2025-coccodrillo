Nossa Senhora da Conceição | The Algarve, Portugal |  Situated opposite Loulé's castle, the mid-17th century chapel of Nossa Senhora da Conceição possesses three impressive elements: a heavily gilded baroque altar, floor-to-ceiling azulejos and a whitewashed stucco ceiling. During excavations, an Islamic door dating from the 3rd century was uncovered under the floor, where it now remains, protected by glass.
