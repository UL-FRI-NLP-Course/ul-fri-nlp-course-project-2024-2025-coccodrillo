Praia da Fal√©sia | Albufeira, Portugal |  One of the Algarve's most impressive beaches is this 6km-long strip of sand backed by stunning cliffs in several shades of ochre. Starting 8.5km east of Albufeira, the strand gets very crowded in summer, especially when the tide is in, but in low season it's all yours.
