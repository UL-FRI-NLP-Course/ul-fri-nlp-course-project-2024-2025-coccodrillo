Museu Etnogr√°fico da Madeira | Madeira, Portugal |  One of Madeira's most interesting museums, the collections here look at every aspect of the island's traditional life, from espada (scabbardfish) fishing to wicker weaving, wine production to toboggan transport. There's an old shop complete with till nostalgically still taking escudos (Portugal's currency before the euro), live weaving demonstrations and fascinating temporary exhibitions to inspect.
