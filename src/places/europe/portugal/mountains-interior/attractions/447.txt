Boca da Encumeada | Madeira, Portugal |  The Encumeada Pass sits between the two deep-cleft valleys that almost slice Madeira in two. From this dramatic point 1083m up, you can see both the north and south coastlines. It's also the starting point for several hikes and long-distance trails. A tunnel under Encumeada means 99% of traffic now bypasses the pass.
