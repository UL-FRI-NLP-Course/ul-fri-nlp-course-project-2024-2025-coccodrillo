Pico do Arieiro | Madeira, Portugal |  You can drive to the top of Pico do Arieiro, Madeira's third highest mountain. At the top you'll find a cafe, a Portuguese Air Force radar station and stupendous views. Try to get up here for the sunrise, though you'll not enjoy the spectacle alone. To get here, take the northwest turn-off from the ER103 at Poiso.
