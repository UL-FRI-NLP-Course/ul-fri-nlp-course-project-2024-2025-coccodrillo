Monterosa Olive Oil | Olhão, Portugal |  Hour-long tours at this gold medal–winning olive oil producer take you around part of the 20-hectare estate showing you the five different varieties of olive trees that are handpicked in autumn, and the Roman-era press in a granite mill where the fruit is ground to a paste before the oil is extracted and filtered, finishing with a tasting. Even if you're not doing a tour, you can stop by its onsite shop to buy oils to take home.
