Igreja de Santo Ildefonso | Aliados & Bolhão, Porto |  This gracefully baroque, early 18th-century, twin-towered church sits on the Praça da Batalha, stopping you dead in your tracks with its resplendent facade, clad in blue-and-white azulejos depicting scenes from the life of St Ildefonso and allegories from the Eucharist.
