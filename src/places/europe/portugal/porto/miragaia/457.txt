Jardim das Virtudes | Miragaia, Porto |  A much-loved picnic spot of tripeiros, these tucked-away gardens stagger down the hillside in a series of lawn terraces. Find a shady spot under the trees to drink in the far-reaching views across the city, which stretch over the rooftops, down to the river and up to the port lodges in Vila Nova de Gaia.
