Igreja Nossa Senhora da Vitória | Miragaia, Porto |  In Porto's medieval Vitória quarter, this church stands on land that once belonged to the Jewish community. Completed in 1539, it was given a baroque makeover in the 18th century following a devastating fire, and features impressive woodcarvings from this period. The Nossa Senhora da Vitória (Blessed Virgin Mary) sculpture in the altar is the handiwork of feted sculptor Soares dos Reis.
