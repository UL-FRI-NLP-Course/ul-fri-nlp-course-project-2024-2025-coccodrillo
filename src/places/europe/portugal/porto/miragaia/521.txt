Igreja de São João Novo | Miragaia, Porto |  Set up above a narrow maze of stone stairs, this medieval church with magnificent views was built in 1539 on land that was originally part of Porto’s old Jewish quarter. It’s a nice place to stop, take a breath and listen to sad fado tunes riding the wind.
