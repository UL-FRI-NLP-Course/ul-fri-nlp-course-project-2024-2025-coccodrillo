Igreja de São Pedro de Miragaia | Miragaia, Porto |  One of Porto's oldest churches, the medieval Igreja de São Pedro de Miragaia was completely rebuilt in the 17th and 18th centuries, and pays homage to St Peter, patron saint of fishermen. Its exterior is beautifully tiled with blue and white azulejos, which segue into its light interior. The altar is a profusion of intricate gilded woodcarvings.
