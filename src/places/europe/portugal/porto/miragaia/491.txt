Casa da Rua São Miguel | Miragaia, Porto |  As you amble down the hill, keep a look out on the right-hand side for the Rua São Miguel. On the corner, at No 4, you'll see a panel of 19th-century blue, white and yellow-trim azulejos (glazed tiles) showing scenes from the life of the Virgin and of everyday life in Porto.
