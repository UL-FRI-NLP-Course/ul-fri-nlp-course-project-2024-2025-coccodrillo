Praça da Ribeira | Ribeira, Porto |  Down by the Rio Douro, narrow streets open out onto a plaza framed by austerely grand, tiled town houses overlooking a picturesque stretch of the river. From here you have fine views of the port-wine lodges across the river, as well as the monumental, double-decker Ponte de Dom Luís I.
