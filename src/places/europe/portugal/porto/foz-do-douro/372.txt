Sealife Porto | Foz do Douro, Porto |  Some 5000 marine creatures splash in the tanks at Sealife, where kiddie highlights include a shark tunnel and a rock pool for handling crabs, starfish and sea urchins. Aquatic oddities include glow-in-the-dark jellyfish, South American leaf fish and cow-nosed rays. See if you can find Nemo, too. The sharks are fed at 11am and 2.30pm sharp, the rays at noon and 4pm.
