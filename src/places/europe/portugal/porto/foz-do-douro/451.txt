SheChanges – Anemone | Foz do Douro, Porto |  Arriving in Matosinhos, you can’t help but stop dead in your tracks as your gaze is drawn upward to this 50m-high sculpture by North American artist Janet Echelman. The giant net, an ode to Matosinhos’ fishing community, is most spectacular when lit up at night. It also changes shape in the wind, hence the name.
