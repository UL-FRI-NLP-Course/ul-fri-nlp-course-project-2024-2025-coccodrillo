Igreja de Santa Marinha | Vila Nova de Gaia, Porto |  In the quaint, alley-woven heart of Vila Nova da Gaia sits this whitewashed church. Built in the 14th century, it was given a baroque makeover in the 18th century by the architect of the age, Nicolau Nasoni. Its high altar displays 18th-century azulejo panels depicting biblical scenes. There are no fixed visiting times â€“ if you're lucky, it will be open.
