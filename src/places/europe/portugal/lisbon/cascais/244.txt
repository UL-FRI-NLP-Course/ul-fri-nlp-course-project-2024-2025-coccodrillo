Parque Marechal Carmona | Cascais, Portugal |  This wild park provides a shady retreat from the seaside crowds, with a duck pond, birch and pine trees, palms and eucalyptus, rose gardens and flowering shrubs.
The grounds harbour the Museu Condes de Castro Guimar√£es, the whimsical early-19th-century mansion complete with castle turrets and Arabic cloister. The lavishly decorated interior houses 17th-century Indo-Portuguese cabinets, oriental silk tapestries and 350-year-old azulejos.
