Reserva Natural do Estuário do Sado | Setúbal, Portugal |  This natural reserve protects the Sado Estuary, a biologically rich area of wetlands extending east and south of Setúbal. With more than 250 avian species, this is a prime spot for birdwatching. The little-visited Moinho de Maré da Mouriscas, 8km east of Setúbal, has short walking trails and a bird observatory across the mudflats.
