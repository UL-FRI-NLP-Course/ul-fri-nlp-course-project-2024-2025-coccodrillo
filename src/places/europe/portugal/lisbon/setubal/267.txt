Casa da Cultura | Setúbal, Portugal |  This newish art space has a packed cultural calendar. Wander through changing exhibitions on the main floor, or stop in for an evening concert of jazz trios, classical quartets and world music. The cinema upstairs has a mix of European art-house fare, children's animated films and documentaries.
Prices are reasonable: exhibitions are free; films and concerts range from free to €7. Stop in the Cafe das Artes for a drink and to see what's on.
