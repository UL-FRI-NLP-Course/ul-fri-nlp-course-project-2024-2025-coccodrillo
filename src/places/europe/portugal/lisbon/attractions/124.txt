Cemit√©rio dos Prazeres | Lisbon, Portugal |  Most visitors come to this cemetery, the largest in Lisbon, for the view of the Rio Tejo right next to the artists' plot. But the elaborate baroque family tombstones of the Portuguese aristocracy are also appealing. Take a free map from the office at the entrance and roam around freely, or contact the cemetery to pre-book a guided tour for a detailed history.
