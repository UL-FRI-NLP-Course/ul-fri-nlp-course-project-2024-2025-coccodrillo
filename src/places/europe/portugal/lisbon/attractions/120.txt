Pal√°cio Baldaya | Lisbon, Portugal |  This cultural centre is in a restored 19th-century palace in the Benfica quarter, a semi-suburban, residential area of Lisbon, full of boutique-sized bakeries and family-owned restaurants and shops. The building pops with colour, and has a garden decorated by urban art, a cafe, a library and co-work spaces. It's aiming to become the city's entertainment spot, with cultural events and live-music concerts.
