Antigo Picadeiro Real | Belém, Lisbon |  Lisbon's original coach museum is now home to just seven of these majestic 18th-century four-wheeled works of art, but it's worth also visiting the stuccoed, frescoed halls of the former royal riding stables built by Italian architect Giacomo Azzolini in 1726 – a far more fitting and palatial rest home than the modern monolith, Museu Nacional dos Coches, across the street.
