Praia da Ilha de Tavira | The Algarve, Portugal |  This huge white-sand beach at the island's eastern end, opposite Tavira, has operators for water sports (such as windsurfing and kitesurfing), beach bars and a campground in summer. Outside the peak months of July and August, it feels wonderfully remote and empty.
