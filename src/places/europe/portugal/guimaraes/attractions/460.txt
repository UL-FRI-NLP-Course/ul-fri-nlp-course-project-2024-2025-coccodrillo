Castelo | Guimarães, Portugal |  Built in the 11th century and still in fine form, the seven-towered castle is thought to be the birthplace of the great man himself, Afonso Henriques. Walk around the windswept ramparts and peruse multilingual exhibits on Portuguese history as you climb to the bird’s-nest heights of Countess Mumadona’s keep.
