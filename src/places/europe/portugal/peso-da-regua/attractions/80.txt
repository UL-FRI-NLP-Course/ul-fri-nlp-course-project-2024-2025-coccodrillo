Miradouro São Leonardo de Galafura | Peso da Régua, Portugal |  For jaw-dropping views of the Douro Valley, head for this magnificent viewpoint between Régua and Pinhão. The N313-2 relentlessly switchbacks its way into the hills northeast from Régua, arriving a half-hour later at the overlook (640m), where the valley's full sweep spreads out before you, the Douro snaking off into the distance between kilometres of steeply terraced vineyards.
