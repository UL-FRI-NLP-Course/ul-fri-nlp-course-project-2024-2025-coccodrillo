Sé | The Douro, Portugal |  Older than Portugal itself, Lamego’s striking sé has been declared a national monument. There is little left of the 12th-century original except the base of its square belfry. The rest of the structure, including the brilliantly carved Gothic triple portal, dates mostly from the 16th and 18th centuries. Arresting biblical frescoes and the high choir stalls are the work of 18th-century Italian baroque architect Nicolau Nasoni, who left his mark all over Porto.
With luck you will find the door open to the peaceful 16th-century cloisters, located just around the corner.
