Largo da Porta de Moura | Ã‰vora, Portugal |  The Moura Gate Sq stands just southeast of the cathedral. Near here was the original entrance to town. In the middle of the square is a strange-looking, globular 16th-century Renaissance fountain. Among the elegant mansions around the square is Casa Cordovil, built in Manueline-Moorish style. Have a look across the road to the west at the extraordinary knotted Manueline stone doorway of the Igreja do Carmo.
