Galeria das Damas | Évora, Portugal |  Inside the walls of the 16th-century Palácio de Dom Manuel is the Galeria das Damas, an indecisive hybrid of Gothic, Manueline, neo-Moorish and Renaissance styles. There are frequent temporary art exhibitions held on the upper floor. The palace is currently closed for long-term renovations, and is scheduled to reopen in late 2020.
