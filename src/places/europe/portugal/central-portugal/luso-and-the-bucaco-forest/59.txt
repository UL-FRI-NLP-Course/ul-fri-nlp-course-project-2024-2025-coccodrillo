Mata Nacional do Buçaco | The Beiras, Portugal |  Sprawling out from the Palacio do Buçaco, this aromatic forest is littered with crumbling chapels, fountains, ponds and exotic trees. There is a network of well-signposted trails leading to features such as the lush Vale dos Fetos (Valley of the Ferns) and the Fonte Fria, a monumental stone staircase near a picturesque pond. Another lovely route is the Via Sacra, which passes a series of chapels as it wends its way up to the Cruz Alta, a hilltop cross offering wonderful views.
From Luso, you can access the forest on foot – it's a steep uphill walk from the southern end of Avenida Emídio Navarro – or by car through the Portas das Ameias some 900m from the centre.
