Statue of João III | Coimbra, Portugal |  Lording it over the main university square, King João III turns his back to the sweeping city views behind him and faces his great centre of learning. It was he who re-established the university in Coimbra in 1537 and invited big-shot scholars to teach here in what had previously been a royal palace.
