Jardim da Manga | Coimbra, Portugal |  This small square, formerly part of the cloister of the Mosteiro de Santa Cruz, is dominated by its monumental centrepiece: a lemon-yellow, four-buttressed fountain that symbolises the source of life. An early example of Renaissance architecture in Portugal, it owes its name to a legend that King Joao III sketched its design on his sleeve (manga in Portuguese).
