Convento de Santa Clara-a-Velha | Coimbra, Portugal |  This Gothic convent was founded in 1330 by the saintly Queen Isabel, Dom Dinisâ€™ wife; it served as her final resting place until flooding forced her to be moved uphill. The adjacent museum displays archaeological finds and shows two films, one about the nuns who lived here, the other documenting the 20-year renovation that cleared the river ooze that had buried it since the 17th century.
