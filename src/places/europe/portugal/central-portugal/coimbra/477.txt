Portugal dos Pequenitos | Coimbra, Portugal |  The brainchild of local collector Bissaya Barreto, this is a cute theme park where kids clamber over, into and around micro versions of Portugalâ€™s most famous monuments, while parents clutch cameras at the ready. There are also three minimuseums dedicated to marine life, furniture and clothing.
