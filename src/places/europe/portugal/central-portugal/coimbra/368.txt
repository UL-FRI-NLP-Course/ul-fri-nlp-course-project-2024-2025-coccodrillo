Jardim Botânico | Coimbra, Portugal |  A serene place to catch your breath, the lovely university-run botanic garden sits in the shadow of the 16th-century Aqueduto de São Sebastião. Founded by the Marquês de Pombal, the garden combines formal flower beds, meandering paths and elegant fountains.
The green-fingered can also visit the lush greenhouses (closed at the time of research).
