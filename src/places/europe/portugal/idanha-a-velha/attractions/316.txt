Ruins | The Beiras, Portugal |  The only remaining vestige of the defences the Knights Templar built in the 13th century is the Torre de Menagem. Also known as the Torre dos Templ√°rios, this rectangular tower, now surrounded by clucking hens, sits atop what was probably the pedestal of a Roman temple. Other Roman remains include a gracefully arched bridge on the east side of the village, and the old wall and gate on the north side.
