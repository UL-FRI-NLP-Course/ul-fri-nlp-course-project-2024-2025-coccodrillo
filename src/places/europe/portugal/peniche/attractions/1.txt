Headland | Peniche, Portugal |  While in Peniche, make sure you do the 8km circuit of the whole headland (walking is hot going, however, as much of it is on the road). At Cabo Carvoeiro, the very tip, there's a lighthouse and spectacular views of a rock stack and the Berlenga islands, as well as an excellent restaurant.
