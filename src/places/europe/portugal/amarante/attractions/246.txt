Museu Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso | The Douro, Portugal |  Hidden in one of the Mosteiro de São Gonçalo’s cloisters is this delightfully eclectic collection of modernist and contemporary art, a pleasant surprise in a town of this size. The museum is named after Amarante’s favourite son, artist Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso (1889–1918) – one of the best-known Portuguese artists of the 20th century, who abandoned naturalism for homegrown versions of Impressionism and cubism. The museum is full of his sketches, cartoons, portraits and abstracts.
