Serra da Boa Viagem | The Beiras, Portugal |  For those with wheels, this wooded headland carpeted in pines, eucalypts and acacias is a fine place for panoramas, picnics and cool walks. To get there it's a simple 4km drive from town: take the coastal road to Buarcos, turn right at the end and follow signs for the Parque Aventura.
