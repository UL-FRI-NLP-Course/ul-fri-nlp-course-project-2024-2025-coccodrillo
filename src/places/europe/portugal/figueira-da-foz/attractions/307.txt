Núcleo Museológico do Sal | The Beiras, Portugal |  In the wetlands south of the city, this small museum charts the centuries-old history of salt production in the area. Old photos and models illustrate production techniques, while outside a network of boardwalks traverse the geometrically divided saltpans. Look out for wetland birds and a pair of giant pink flamingos.Realistically, you'll need your own wheels to get to the museum, which is about 9km outside Figueira.
