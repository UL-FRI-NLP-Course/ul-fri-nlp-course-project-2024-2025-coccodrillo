Visigothic Tombs | The Beiras, Portugal |  Across the road from the Portas do Prado by the courthouse car park, you'll find an untended mass of grey rocks, many of which have been shaped into eerie, body-shaped cavities. These were discovered during construction of the court in the 1960s, and are thought to be Visigothic tombs dating to the 7th or 8th century.
