Praia da Arrifana | Aljezur, Portugal |  Embraced by cliffs, this seductive crescent-shaped cove 10km southwest of Aljezur has a small fishing harbour and an offshore pinnacle. It's wildly popular with surfers of all abilities. There's a small beachside restaurant, with more lining the clifftop to the ruined fortress.
