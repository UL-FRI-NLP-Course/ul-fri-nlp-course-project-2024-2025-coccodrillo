Museu de Arte Sacra | Aljezur, Portugal |  Built in the 16th century and damaged in the 1755 earthquake, the modest Igreja da Miseric√≥rdia church was reconstructed in the 18th century. Its small religious-art museum houses items donated by a locally born Monsignor. The highlights are the old church bell and a 14th-century crown. Visit the museum first and the guardian will open the church for you. Entry to three other Aljezur museums is included in admission.
