Castelo | Aljezur, Portugal |  On the site of an Iron Age fort, the polygonal castle was built by the Moors in the 10th century, conquered by the Christians in 1249, then abandoned in the late 15th century. The walls and a couple of towers survive, as well as a cistern. Sweeping views of the surrounding area extend from the rock in its centre and ramparts.
