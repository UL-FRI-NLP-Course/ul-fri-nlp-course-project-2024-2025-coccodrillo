Ruinas da Fortaleza de Arrifana | Aljezur, Portugal |  A boardwalk leads through the remaining gate of this 1635-built fortress. Largely wiped out by the tsunami following the 1755 earthquake, the fortress was rebuilt several times before being abandoned in the early 19th century. Aside from the gate and crumbling walls, very little remains today, but the clifftop views are magnificent â€“ a coin-operated telescope provides close-ups.
