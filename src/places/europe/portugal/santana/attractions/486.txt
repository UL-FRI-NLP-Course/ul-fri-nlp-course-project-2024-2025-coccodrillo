Parque Tem√°tico da Madeira | Madeira, Portugal |  An engaging place to take the kids, this Madeira-themed park has a boating lake, a maze, a Monte train, mock-ups of Santana A-Frame houses, a large kiddies playground, some Madeira-specific exhibitions and a cafe. It's all quite informative but probably not worth a special trip from Funchal.
