Porto Santo Beach | Madeira, Portugal |  Porto Santo's 7.5km long sandy beach is the reason most people head to Madeira's little sister. The sand is actually tiny pieces of coral that shelve gently into the cool Atlantic waves. The beach has virtually no development along it and has a wild feel, especially in winter when you can have the whole thing to yourself.
