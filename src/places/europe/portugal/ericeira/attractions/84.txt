Miradouro Ribeira d'Ilhas | Ericeira, Portugal |  If you dropped dead of a heart attack a moment after ogling this jaw-dropping view above Ribeira d'Ilhas and Alibabá beaches – and the surfers tackling the waves of the Ericeira World Surfing Reserve – you'd die happy. Absolutely stunning. Further words unnecessary.
