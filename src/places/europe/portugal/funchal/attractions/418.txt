Jardim de São Martinho | Funchal, Portugal |  Just below Igreja de São Martinho, you'll discover the lovely Jardim de São Martinho, a south-facing, artificially created set of gardens with thousands of exotic plants tumbling down a terraced hillside to a children's playground. Pathways zigzag through the palms, succulents and bursts of blossom as lizards scuttle away underfoot.
