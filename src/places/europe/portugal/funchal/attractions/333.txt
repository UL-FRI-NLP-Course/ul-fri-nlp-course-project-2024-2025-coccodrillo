Fortaleza de Santiago | Funchal, Portugal |  The ochre and dark-pink fortress that caps the Zona Velha seafront was built in the first half of the 17th century, when Funchal was vulnerable to pirate attacks. The complex is set to become Madeira's Archaeology Museum at some point in the coming years, but most of the fun here will still be about scrambling around the various rooms, turrets, battlements and hidden corners. Expect great photo ops.
