Quinta da Boa Vista | Funchal, Portugal |  Founded by a former Honorary British Consul Cecil Garton, this garden is the best place to experience Madeira's exquisite orchids. The orchid houses are a riot of Cattleyas, Cymbidiums and Paphiopedilums but the rest of the place could do with a tidy round.
