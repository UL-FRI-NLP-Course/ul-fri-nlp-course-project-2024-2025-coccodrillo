Museu de Hist√≥ria Natural | Funchal, Portugal |  This old-fashioned museum, housed (in classic Funchal fashion) in a surplus palace, has an ageing aquarium on the ground floor, and stuffed local fauna, including many sea creatures, upstairs. Highlights include an interesting 3D map of Madeira and a display of spiders you definitely didn't know inhabited the island before you booked your holiday. The museum is also a venue for more 21st-century temporary exhibitions, usually included in the ticket price.
