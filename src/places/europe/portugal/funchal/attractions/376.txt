Borges | Funchal, Portugal |  Borges is the smallest of Funchal's Madeira wine operations and its diminutive, timber-rich tasting room feels like the furthest away from the tourist crush and is the quietest of the Funchal wineries. Any two of the excellent wines (up to 20 years old) can be tasted free of charge, often with a free chunk of bolo de mel (molasses cake) to help it along.
