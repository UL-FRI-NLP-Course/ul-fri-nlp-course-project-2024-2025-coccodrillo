Monte | Funchal, Portugal |  High above Funchal, the villa neighbourhood of Monte is one of the most popular half-day trips from Funchal seafront. The Igreja da Nossa Senhora and the Monte Palace Tropical Gardens are the top sights here, but most come for a unique attraction â€“ the wicker toboggan ride down to Livramento. Many take the cable car from the seafront up to Monte, see the sights then return by toboggan and bus.
