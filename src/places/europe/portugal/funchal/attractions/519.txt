Jardim Panorâmico | Funchal, Portugal |  Up a set of steps from the seafront, the terraced Jardim Panorâmico is a sun-catching spot ideal for a lazy afternoon with a book. It's also a superb halt with children as there are go-karts, a bouncy castle and crazy golf, as well as a couple of cafes nearby.
