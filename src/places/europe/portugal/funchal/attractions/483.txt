Jardim de Santa Luzia | Funchal, Portugal |  Created from an old sugar works – hence the huge chimney in the middle and old bits of machinery scattered around the place – this undervisited city-centre oasis has heaps of exotic plant life, its own levada, a great playground and a cafe. It also hosts an occasional Sunday flea market.
