Blandy's | Funchal, Portugal |  Housed in the Adegas de SÃ£o Francisco, the former Franciscan monastery, Blandy's brings together the British-Madeiran wine companies that were given special trading rights with Britain in the 17th century. The best known of Madeira's wine experiences, the 45-minute tours here are led by clued-up guides and there are two free samples at the end.
