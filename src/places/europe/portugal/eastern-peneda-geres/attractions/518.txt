Capela de São João de Fraga | Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês, Portugal |  Standing alone on a rocky mountaintop, this whitewashed chapel surrounded by rugged peaks is an important pilgrimage site for the residents of Pitões das Júnias, who make an annual procession here on the first Sunday after the feast day of São João (24 June).
