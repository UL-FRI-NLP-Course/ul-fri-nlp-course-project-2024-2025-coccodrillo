Mosteiro de Santa Maria das Júnias | Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês, Portugal |  Built on the site of a 9th-century pre-Romanesque hermitage, this lovely 12th-century Benedictine monastery in a remote river valley fell under the sway of the Cistercians in the middle of the 13th century. The church here remains largely intact, surrounded by the ruins of several outbuildings.
