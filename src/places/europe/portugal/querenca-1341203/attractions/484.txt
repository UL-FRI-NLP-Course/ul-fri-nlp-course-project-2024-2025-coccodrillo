Pólo Museológico da Água | The Algarve, Portugal |  On the village square, this small museum has a model of a waterwheel as well as information panels (in Portuguese) on water use. There's also a tourist office here, and it holds the keys to the church opposite. Despite official opening hours, you'll often find staff members here at weekends.
