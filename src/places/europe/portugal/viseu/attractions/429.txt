Casa da Ribeira | Viseu, Portugal |  Housed in a smart stone house on the river Pavia, this small cultural centre focuses on the area's traditional way of life and artisanal skills. There's a display on the ground floor exhibiting various domestic objects as well as a typical river boat and a working wool loom, while upstairs is given over to temporary exhibitions.
