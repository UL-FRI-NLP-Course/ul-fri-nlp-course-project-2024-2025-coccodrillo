Mudas Museu | Madeira, Portugal |  Housed in an almost Minecraft-like building high above Calheta, this contemporary arts space has a gallery, shop, cafe, auditorium and workshop area. The exhibitions here change every two months or so and Paulo David's dramatic architectural achievement in basalt is admirable. It's worth getting a taxi from the beach as it's a hard slog on foot.
