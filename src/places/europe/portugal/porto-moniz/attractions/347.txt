Centro CiÃªncia Viva | Madeira, Portugal |  This now-ageing centre covers a wide range of scientific topics in a hands-on way. The focus is on Madeira's Unesco-listed laurisilva forests, their climate, biodiversity and the human relationship with it. Interactive exhibits include a barefoot forest-floor walk, a virtual levada and heaps of touchscreens, puzzles and films. Sadly the project has withered on the vine in recent years.
