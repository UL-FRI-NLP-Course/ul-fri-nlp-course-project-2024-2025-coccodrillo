Igreja Nossa Senhora Conceição | The Beiras, Portugal |  Resembling a strange, Disney-like vision of what a quaint village church should look like, Piódão's white church stands out like a beacon against the grey schist of the surrounding houses. It's believed to have been built on the site of a former chapel, though the current building, funded by locals, dates to the early 19th century.
