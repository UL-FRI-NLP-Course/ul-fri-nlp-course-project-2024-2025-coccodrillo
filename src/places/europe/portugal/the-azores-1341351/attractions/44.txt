Lagoa do Congro | The Azores, Portugal |  This hidden lagoon, about 5.5 km from Vila Franca do Campo on The Azores largest island of SÃ£o Miguel, is an emerald-colored oasis. Surrounded by lush vegetation, to reach this remote lake you must hike along a 700 meter trail, but there is signage to guide you toward the correct path. The reward is a totally breathtaking view and the feeling of complete solitude.
