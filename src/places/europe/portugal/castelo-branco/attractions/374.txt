Centro de Cultura Contempor√¢nea de Castelo Branco | The Beiras, Portugal |  Castelo Branco's modernist cultural centre has quickly established itself as town landmark since it was inaugurated in 2013. The cutting-edge building, designed by the Barcelona-based Josep Lluis Mateo and Portuguese architect Carlos Reis de Figueiredo, provides a stunning space for temporary exhibitions with its cantilevered floors extending over the town plaza.
