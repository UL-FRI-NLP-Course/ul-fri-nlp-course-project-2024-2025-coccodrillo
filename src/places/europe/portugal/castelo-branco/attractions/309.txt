Museu Cargaleiro | The Beiras, Portugal |  This extraordinary museum is spread over two buildings, a mid-18th-century house in Rua dos Cavaleiros (Knights Street) and a clashing contemporary building nearby. On display are many works by Manuel Cargaleiro (1927–), a celebrated Portuguese ceramicist and painter whose style has been influenced by the École de Paris (Paris School of Artists). You'll also find paintings by other Portuguese and international artists.
