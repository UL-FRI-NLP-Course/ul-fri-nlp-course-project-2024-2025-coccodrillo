Aldeia Típica José Franco | Portugal, Europe |  At the village of Sobreiro, 4km northwest of Mafra (take any Ericeira-bound bus), sculptor José Franco has created an enchanting miniature, vaguely surreal craft village of windmills, watermills and traditional shops. Kids love it here; as do some adults, especially when they discover the rustic adega (winery) serving red wine and snacks. Most folks, however, bring a picnic.
