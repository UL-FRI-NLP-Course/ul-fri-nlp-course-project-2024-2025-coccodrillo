Cristo Rei | Madeira, Portugal |  The upmarket village of Garajau hangs for dear life on the side of a cliff, 6km as the crow flies from central Funchal. On an often blustery promontory below the village stands the Cristo Rei â€“ a late-1920s mini-version of Rio's Christ the Redeemer statue, arms outspread, eyes gazing into the infinite blue of the Atlantic.
