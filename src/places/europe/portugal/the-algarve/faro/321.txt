Igreja de SÃ£o Francisco | Faro, Portugal |  The foundations of this monastery's church were laid in 1679 and it was enlarged during the 18th and 19th centuries. Behind its blinding white facade are dazzling woodwork and a frenzied 18th-century baroque interior with hand-painted azulejo tiles on the walls and a barrel-vaulted ceiling depicting the life of St Francis.
Part of the monastery now houses the Algarve's tourism and hospitality school.
