Ponte Romana | Tavira, Portugal |  This seven-arched Roman Bridge that loops away from Praça da República may actually pre-date the Romans but is so named because it linked the Roman road from Castro Marim to Tavira. The structure you see dates from a 1667 reconstruction; it's been car-free since flood damage in 1989, but remains accessible to pedestrians.
