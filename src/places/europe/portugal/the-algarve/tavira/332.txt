Castelo | Tavira, Portugal |  Tavira's ruined castle rises high and mighty above the town. Possibly dating back to Neolithic times, the structure was rebuilt by Phoenicians and later taken over by the Moors; most of what now stands is a 17th-century reconstruction. The interior contains an exotic botanic garden, and the octagonal tower affords fine views over Tavira. Note that the ramparts are without railings, so parents beware.
