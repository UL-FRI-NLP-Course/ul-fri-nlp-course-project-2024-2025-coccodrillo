Ruínas Fenícias de Tavira | Tavira, Portugal |  Astonishing archaeological remains found on this site just below the castelo date from the 8th century BC through to the 18th century AD. Digs have unearthed part of a Phoenician wall circa 800 BC, an ox-hide altar from the 4th century BC thought to be Turdetanian (the pre-Roman Iberian civilisation), Moorish foundations from the 12th century AD and a 17th-century Portuguese mansion.
A museum dedicated to the Phoenician and Turdetani periods is planned here once excavations have finished.
