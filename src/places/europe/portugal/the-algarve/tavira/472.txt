Biblioteca Municipal Álvaro de Campos | Tavira, Portugal |  Architecture buffs should pay a visit to Tavira’s municipal library, which was originally the town prison. Architect João Luís Carrilho da Graça sympathetically converted the former prison’s facade and cells into a modern, harmonious cultural space in 2005, which hosts occasional exhibitions.
