Praia do Martinhal | Sagres, Portugal |  One of the prettier beaches in the Sagres area, 2.5km northeast of the centre, Martinhal is backed by a resort development, so it's a little complex to find by car, but it's an easy 800m walk north from the port. The water is calm and the angle of entry shallow, making it ideal for families.
