Pharmácia Leonardo Paiva | Estremadura & Ribatejo, Portugal |  Opposite Leiria's cathedral stands the wonderfully tiled Pharmácia Leonardo Paiva – the beautiful azulejos depict Hippocrates, Galen and Socrates. Novelist Eça de Queirós used to live in Travessa Tipografia next to the cathedral, and he and his literary group met regularly in the pharmacy. These days, it’s a nondescript bar called Anubis.
