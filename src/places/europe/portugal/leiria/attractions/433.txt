M|i|mo | Estremadura & Ribatejo, Portugal |  Just below the castle, this likeable museum focuses on the history of the moving image, with a fine collection of cine cameras and temporary exhibitions on the top floor. Best is the interactive floor in between, with lots of optical illusions and things to spin. It's worth getting the audio guide (free; English and Spanish).
