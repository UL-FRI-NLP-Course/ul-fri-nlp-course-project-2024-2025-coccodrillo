Praia do Cabedelo | Viana do Castelo, Portugal |  This is one of the Minho’s best beaches: a 1km-long arc of blonde, powdery sand that folds into grassy dunes backed by a grove of wind-blown pines. It’s across the river from town, best reached on a five-minute ferry trip from the pier south of Largo 5 de Outubro.
