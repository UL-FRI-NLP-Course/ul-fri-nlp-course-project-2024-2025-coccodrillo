Templo do Sagrado Coração de Jesus | Viana do Castelo, Portugal |  This fabulously over-the-top, 20th-century, neo-Byzantine church is one of two reasons to visit Viana’s 228m eucalyptus-clad hill. You can get a little closer to heaven by climbing to the zimbório (lantern tower) atop its dome, via a lift, followed by an elbow-scraping stairway; take the museum entrance on the ground floor.
