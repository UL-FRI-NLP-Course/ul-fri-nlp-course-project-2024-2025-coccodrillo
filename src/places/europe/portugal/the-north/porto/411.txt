Douro Marina | Porto, Portugal |  Architects Barbosa & Guimar√£es have left their imprint on this contemporary marina complex in Afurada. With forms that mirror the shape of boat masts and sails, the vision in glass and steel propels you back to the here and now. It harbours a sailing academy, shops (some selling nautical paraphernalia), cafes and a bike rental place.
