Lavadouro Público | Porto, Portugal |  Washing machines are installed in every house, but local donas (ladies) still swear by the daily ritual of stone washtubs and good old-fashioned elbow grease at the lavadouro público (communal laundry). A blast from a bygone age, this is where they come to wash their whites, natter and sing – a social gathering with abundant soaping and scrubbing.
Pop in for a quick nose around and to brush up on your Portuguese.
