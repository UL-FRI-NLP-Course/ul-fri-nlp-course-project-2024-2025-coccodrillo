Ponte Maria Pia | Porto, Portugal |  Ponte Dom Lu√≠s I might hog the limelight, but it is this railway bridge, slightly further east, that bears the hallmark of Gustave Eiffel. Built when the Eiffel Tower was but a twinkle in his eye, the bridge was a remarkable feat of engineering and the longest single-arch span in the world when it was completed in 1877.
