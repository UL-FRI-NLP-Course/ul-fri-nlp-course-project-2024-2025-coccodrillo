St Mary's Church | Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog, Wales |  Built over 900 years ago as a chapel associated with the Benedictine monastery up the hill (now the cathedral), this large stone church dominates Brecon's town centre. Rebuilt and added to extensively over the years, especially in the 19th century, it's Brecon's parish church, now housing a daytime cafe and often used for concerts.
