Denbigh Castle | Snowdonia & the Ll≈∑n, Wales |  During the Civil War Denbigh was a Royalist stronghold (Charles I once stayed here) and owes its ruined state to the Parliamentarians, who destroyed it in 1660. There's not a lot to see, but the triple-towered gatehouse remains impressive, and a section of wall offers great views over the countryside. From November to March the castle is unstaffed (and admission is free) Monday to Thursday.
