Ianto's Shrine | Cardiff, Wales |  For over a decade Cardiff has been the filming location for famed TV series Doctor Who and its spin-off, Torchwood. In 2009 one of the main characters of Torchwood – Ianto Jones – was killed off. Since then, a shrine dedicated to the character and maintained by fans has existed at what was Ianto’s Tourist Information Office on Mermaid Quay's boardwalk.
