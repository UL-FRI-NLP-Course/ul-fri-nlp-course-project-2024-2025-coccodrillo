Llangollen Museum | Snowdonia & the Ll≈∑n, Wales |  Staffed by committed volunteers of the best sort, this diverting little museum of local history occupies a hexagonal building retaining some of the air of the library it once was. Filled to the brim with artefacts relating Llangollen's journey through the years, its crowning glory (unless you're a kid and into dress-ups) is the gravestone of the Ladies of Llangollen.
