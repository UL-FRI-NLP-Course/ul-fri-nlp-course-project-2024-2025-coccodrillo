Kraanspoor | Amsterdam Noord, Amsterdam |  'Craneway' is an extraordinary piece of architecture, built above a repurposed (you've guessed it) craneway, by OTH Architecten in 2007. The glass box above the stilts of the industrial base looks almost weightless, and houses offices with amazing waterfront views.
