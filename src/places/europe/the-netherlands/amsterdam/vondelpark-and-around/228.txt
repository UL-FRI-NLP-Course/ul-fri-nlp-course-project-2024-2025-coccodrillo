The Fish | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  A cut above regular park statuary is Picasso's soaring, approximately 6m-high abstract work Figure découpée l’Oiseau (Bird Cut Out), better known locally as the The Fish (1965), which he donated for the park's centenary. It's located roughly in the middle of the Vondelpark, closer to the southern side.
