Moco Museum | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  A private house, the 1904 Villa Alsberg has been converted into the 'Modern Contemporary' (Moco) museum by a couple who are private collectors and curators. The cramped rooms are not an ideal gallery space, but big-name exhibitions by artists such as Banksy, Yayoi Kusama and Salvador Dal√≠ haul in the crowds, and it's interesting to explore the building.
