Riekermolen | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  Like a scene from another century, just outside Amstelpark's south edge, on the west bank of the Amstel River, stands this 1636 windmill. In a field southwest of the mill, you'll find a statue of a sitting Rembrandt, who sketched the windmill here along the riverbank.
