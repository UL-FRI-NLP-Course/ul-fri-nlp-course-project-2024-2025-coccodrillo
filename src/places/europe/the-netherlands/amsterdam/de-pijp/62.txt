Sarphatipark | De Pijp, Amsterdam |  While the Vondelpark is bigger in size and reputation, this tranquil English-style park delivers an equally potent shot of pastoral summertime relaxation, with far fewer crowds. Named after Samuel Sarphati (1813â€“66), a Jewish doctor, businessman and urban innovator, the grounds incorporate ponds, gently rolling meadows and wooded fringes. In the centre is the 1886-built Sarphati Memorial, a bombastic temple with a fountain, gargoyles and a bust of the great man himself.
