Hortus Botanicus | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  A botanical garden since 1638, it bloomed as tropical seeds and plants were brought in by Dutch trading ships. From here, coffee, pineapple, cinnamon and palm-oil plants were distributed throughout the world. The 4000-plus species are kept in wonderful structures, including the colonial-era seed house and a three-climate glasshouse.
The butterfly house is a hit with kids in particular. Free one-hour guided tours take place at fixed times or on request; check the schedule on the website.
