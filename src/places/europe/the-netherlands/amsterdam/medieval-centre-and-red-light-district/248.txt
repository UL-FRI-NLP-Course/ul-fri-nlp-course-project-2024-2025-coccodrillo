Warmoesstraat | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  Amsterdam's earliest canals grew out from the IJ River like the roots of a tree, and Warmoesstraat was one of the first streets to follow. Its historical pedigree pales next to its current line-up of leather bars, coffeeshops and fetish shops interspersed with galleries and cool cafes.
