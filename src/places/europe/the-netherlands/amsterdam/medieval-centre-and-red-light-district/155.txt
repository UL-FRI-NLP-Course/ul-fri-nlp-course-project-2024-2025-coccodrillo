Allard Pierson Museum | Medieval Centre & Red Light District, Amsterdam |  Run by the University of Amsterdam and named for its first professor of archaeology, Allard Pierson (1831â€“96), this museum contains a rich archaeological collection made accessible by its manageable scale. You'll find an actual mummy, vases from ancient Greece and Mesopotamia, a very cool wagon from the royal tombs at Salamis (Cyprus), and galleries full of other items providing insight into daily life in ancient times. There are detailed descriptions in Dutch and English.
