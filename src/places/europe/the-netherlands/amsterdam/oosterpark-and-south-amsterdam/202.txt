Park Frankendael | Amsterdam, The Netherlands |  These lovely, landscaped gardens are the grounds of a former country estate; the mansion, Frankendael House, is still standing and there are walking paths, flapping storks, decorative bridges and the remains of follies. The excellent De Pure Markt is held here on the last Sunday of each month.
