KPN Telecom Headquarters | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  Designed by celebrated architect Renzo Piano and opened in 2000, the bizarre KPN Telecom headquarters building leans at a sharp angle, seemingly resting on a long pole. The six-degree lean is the same as the Leaning Tower of Pisa's â€“ a suitably Italian reference by one of Italy's greatest architects.
