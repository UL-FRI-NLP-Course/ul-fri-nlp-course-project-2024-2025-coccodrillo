Kralingse Bos & Plas | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  This bucolic park sits just outside the city centre and offers a delightfully laidback mixture of shaded forest, sparkling waters and manicured grass. It’s a peaceful spot where locals come to cycle, sail, row and ride horses. The walk around the lake takes about an hour. Finish off with a cold drink at one of the park’s lakeside cafes.
