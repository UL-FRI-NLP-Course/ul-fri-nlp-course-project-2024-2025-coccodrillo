Stadhuis | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  One of the few city-centre buildings to emerge unscathed after the WWII bombardments, this grandiose building designed by HJ Evers was constructed between 1912 and 1920. Evers designed it to have four wings around a central rectangular court that can be accessed via a laneway that intersects the building.
