Kijk-Kubus Museumwoning | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  Here, you'll be able to get a feel for what it's like to live in one of Rotterdam's most famous buildings, the 45-degree-tilted, cube-shaped apartments in the Overblaak Development. Climb the steep and narrow stairs and you'll find a tiny and – truth be told – pretty unimpressive 100-sq-m interior over four levels. The decor is sadly shabby.
