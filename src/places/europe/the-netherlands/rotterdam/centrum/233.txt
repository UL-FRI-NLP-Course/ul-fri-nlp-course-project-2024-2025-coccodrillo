Caf√© De Unie | Rotterdam, The Netherlands |  A tribute to the original De Stijl building designed by JJP Oud and built in 1924, this cafe features the bright colours that are forever associated with that art and architecture movement (red, yellow, blue and white). Oud's building was destroyed in the 1940 bombardment, and this facade was reconstructed in 1986.
