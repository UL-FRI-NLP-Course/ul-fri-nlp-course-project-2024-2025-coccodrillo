Van Abbemuseum | Eindhoven, The Netherlands |  This superb modern-art gallery uses elements of its rich collection (including originals by Picasso, Braque, Kandinsky and LÃ©ger) along with plenty of contemporary material to ask probing questions about the nature of art, its changing role and the space that contains it. The building itself is a dramatic architectural statement, the original castle-style 1936 gallery conjoined with a multilevel 2003 grey-stone addition that incorporates a weir of the Dommel river. The waterside cafe is worth a linger too.
