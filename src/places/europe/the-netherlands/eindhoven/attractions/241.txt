Evoluon | Eindhoven, The Netherlands |  Like the Atomium to Brussels, the Evoluon is an icon of retro-futurist architecture. Built in 1966, it serves as both a science centre and a rental conference centre. You can gawp at its UFO-style design as you drive by on the 401 airport bus or photograph it across the fence from Noord Brabantlaan.
The science centre is open Wednesday through Sunday, but frequently closes for private events, so be sure to check the schedule on the website.
