Rijksmuseum Boerhaave | Leiden, The Netherlands |  Named in honour of physician, botanist, chemist and University of Leiden teacher Herman Boerhaave (1668â€“1738), this impressive museum of science and medicine has exhibits profiling major scientific discoveries in the Netherlands, and the doctors and scientists behind them. The museum is housed in a 15th-century convent that later became the first academic hospital in Northern Europe, and a multimedia introduction is presented in a recreated anatomical theatre.
