Hortus Botanicus Leiden | Leiden, The Netherlands |  Founded by the University of Leiden in 1590, this is one of Europe's oldest botanical gardens (the oldest was created in Padua, Italy, in 1545). The majority of its collections originate from Southeast and East Asia. Built structures include an 18th-century orangery and a tropical glasshouse constructed in 1938; more recent additions include a winter garden and Chinese herb garden. Its orchid greenhouses are closed on weekends.
