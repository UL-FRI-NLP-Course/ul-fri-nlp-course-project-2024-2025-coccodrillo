Binnenhof | Den Haag, The Netherlands |  Home to both houses of the Dutch government, this complex of buildings next to the Hofvijver is arranged around a central courtyard that was once used for executions. Its splendid ceremonial Ridderzaal dates back to the 13th century. The 17th-century North Wing is still home to the Upper House, but the Lower House meets in a chamber in the modern eastern part of the complex. Visitor organisation ProDemos conducts guided tours.
