Sint-Willibrod-Kerk | Utrecht, The Netherlands |  Easily missed, this 1877 neo-Gothic church has a gorgeously colourful interior with splendid stained glass, pattern-painted columns and plentiful gilt-work including the big, medieval-styled crucifixion statue balanced high above the apse on a triomfbalk ('beam of triumph') featuring portraits of the 12 apostles.
