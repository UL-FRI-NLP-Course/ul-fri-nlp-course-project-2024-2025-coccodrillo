Museum voor het Kruideniersbedrijf | Utrecht, The Netherlands |  Tucked into a narrow lane is this charming replica of an old grocery store, where apron-costumed people sell sweets and tea by weight from decorative containers.
The blocks of white liquorice candy are, by old Dutch tradition, used to add flavour to hot milk.
