Nederlands Stripmuseum | Groningen, The Netherlands |  This museum covers the work of Holland's and Belgium's most renowned comic artists and their creations, including Tintin (here known as Kuifje), Suske & Wiske and, oddly, Donald Duck.
In 2020 the museum will move into the newly opened Forum building on Nieuwe Markt.
