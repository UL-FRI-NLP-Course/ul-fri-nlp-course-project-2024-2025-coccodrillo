De Tobbedanser | Friesland, The Netherlands |  Across from the ferry port, this bronze statue encircled by a wooden bench is a lovely spot to sit and contemplate the pretty waterside views. Sculpted by Dutch sculptor Bert Kiewiet (1918–2008), the statue harks back to Harlingen's wool-manufacturing days. Fabric was washed in large tubs of water with one's feet, hence the local nickname for people from Harlingen – Tobbedansers ('tub dancers').
