Museum Hannemahuis Harlingen | Friesland, The Netherlands |  Housed in the 18th-century mansion of a prominent Harlingen family, this museum deals primarily with the town's maritime heritage, in particular its role in the whaling industry, which brought so much wealth to Friesland in the 1700s. Other exhibits cover such other noble pursuits as silver crafting and jenever (Dutch gin) distilling.
