Vrijthof | Maastricht, The Netherlands |  Home to a range of city festivities and occasional funfairs, the Vrijthof is an expansive square on which a row of terrace cafes face off against two magnificent churches. Punctuated by interesting shops and any number of places for a drink, the narrow streets to its east and southeast form Maastricht's most appealing zone for random exploration.
