Kulla | Theth, Albania |  A visit to this fascinating 400-year-old 'lock-in tower' gives you an idea of the life those condemned by their family ties would lead as they waited, protected, during a blood feud. You can visit two floors and imagine the spartan weeks or even months spent by those poor souls who found themselves next in line to be killed. There are no set opening hours. If it's closed, ask in nearby houses and someone will come and open up.
