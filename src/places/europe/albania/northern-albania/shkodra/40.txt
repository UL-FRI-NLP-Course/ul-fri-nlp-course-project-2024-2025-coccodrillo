Rozafa Fortress Museum | Shkodra, Albania |  The small museum inside the Rozafa Fortress is worth a look for anyone interested in the history of the fortress and town and covers the neolithic period onwards. Upstairs there's a large model of the entire castle site as well as some partial mosaics discovered here. These are the only mosaics ever discovered in northern Albania.
