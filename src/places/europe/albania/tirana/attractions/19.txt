Et'hem Bey Mosque | Tirana, Albania |  To one side of Sheshi Skënderbej, the 1789–1823 Et'hem Bey Mosque was spared destruction during the atheism campaign of the late 1960s because of its status as a cultural monument. Small and elegant, it's one of the oldest buildings left in the city. At the time of research the mosque was closed to the public for major renovations.
