Ethnological Museum | Saranda, Albania |  Housed in Saranda's old customs house overlooking the town wharf, this interesting museum contains many fascinating photographs from the communist era, alongside a rather motley collection of ethnographic relics. Particularly worth seeing are the early-20th-century photos, which illustrate how much the town has changed in a relatively short time.
