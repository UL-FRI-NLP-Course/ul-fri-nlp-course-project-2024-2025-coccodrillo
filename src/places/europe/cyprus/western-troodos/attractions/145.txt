Childhood House of Makarios | Cyprus, Europe |  The childhood house of Archbishop Makarios III, Cyprus' first president, contains photos and memorabilia from his younger years. It's a considerable sized building, considering his familyâ€™s peasant status (then again, the livestock would have lived in one of the rooms!). If the house is locked, you can obtain the key from the nearby cultural centre.
