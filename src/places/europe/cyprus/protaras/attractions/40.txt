Fig Tree Bay | Cyprus, Europe |  The most popular, and best, of Protaras' sandy strips, Fig Tree Bay lies at the southern end of the Protaras seaside promenade. It has a small sand island just off the coast, which is great for snorkelling, with lots of fish to be seen, and the promenade behind it is shoulder-to-shoulder bars, cafes and restaurants.
