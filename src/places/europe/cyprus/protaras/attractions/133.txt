Magic Dancing Waters | Cyprus, Europe |  If a bit of jazz-hands dazzle helps get your young kids to bed easier, this one-hour show where water seems to dance and spin, followed by a dramatic erupting volcano experience, should wear them out. It's all accompanied by music with laser lights, holograms and various other special effects. Keep your expectations in check, though; despite the price tag, this isn't Las Vegas.
