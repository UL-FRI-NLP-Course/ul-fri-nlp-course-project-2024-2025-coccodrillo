Akrotiri Environment Centre | Cyprus, Europe |  Just south of Akrotiri village, this centre has exhibits on the areaâ€™s flora and fauna, a wildlife observation kiosk and a short 2km cultural trail that leads to the village. It's great for kids, with plenty of hands-on activities, microscopes and touch-screen exhibits. Look for the somewhat incongruous carving of a leprechaun near the front door of the building.
