Timiou Stavrou Church | Cyprus, Europe |  Although the building you see today was greatly remodelled in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Timiou Stavrou (Holy Cross) Church dates back to the 14th century. The iconostasis holds some lovely 18th-century icons, and the wooden cross kept in the crypt is said to contain a piece of the true cross.
