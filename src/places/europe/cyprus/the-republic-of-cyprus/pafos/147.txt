Archaeological Museum | Pafos, Cyprus |  Essentially for admirers of archaeological minutiae, this small museum houses a varied and extensive collection of artefacts from the neolithic period to the 18th century. Displayed in four rooms, exhibits include jars, pottery and glassware, tools and coins. Note that at time of writing the museum was closed for refurbishment until November 2017.
