Agios Lambrianos Rock-Cut Tomb | Pafos, Cyprus |  North of the centre, on the side of Fabrica Hill, are a couple of enormous underground caverns dating from the early Hellenistic period. These are burial chambers associated with the saints Lambrianos and Misitikos. The interiors of the tombs bear frescos that indicate they were used as a Christian place of worship.
