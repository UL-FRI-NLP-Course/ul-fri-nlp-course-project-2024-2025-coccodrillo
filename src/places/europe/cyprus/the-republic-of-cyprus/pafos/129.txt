Tala Monastery Cat Park | Pafos, Cyprus |  Cat lovers won't want to miss this cat park, where, at the latest count, some 700 kitties were being lovingly looked after by founder Dawn (who knows all their names!) and her team of volunteers. Donations (or cat food) gratefully received and it is not unheard of for tourists to volunteer here for a day (or more). It's that kind of place.
Tala is located between Pafos and Coral Bay.
