Chrysaliniotissa Quarter | Nicosia (Lefkosia), Cyprus |  Centred around the Panagia Chrysaliniotissa church, this residential neighbourhood on the edge of the Old City rubs right up against the Green Line, and so was left for years to decay. Today its narrow streets have been revitalised with some lovely restored facades of early 20th-century town houses and alleyways of cottage terrace rows, fringed by pot plants. Its lanes are a charming and peaceful place for a stroll.
