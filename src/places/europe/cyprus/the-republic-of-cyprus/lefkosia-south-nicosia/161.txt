Archbishopâ€™s Palace | Nicosia (Lefkosia), Cyprus |  This rather grand building is the residence of the current archbishop and also houses the offices and administration of the archdiocese. It was built in the late 1950s, in neo-Byzantine style, to replace the old palace, which now houses the Folk Art Museum. No public access.
