Loukia & Michael Zampelas Art Museum | Nicosia (Lefkosia), Cyprus |  This small private gallery, dedicated to promoting contemporary Cypriot art, houses the Zampelas family's permanent art collection. A range of Cypriot and Greek modern artists are represented, but also on show are etchings by Picasso and Dal√≠, and two stand-out paintings by Welsh artist Glyn Hughes, who spent much of his life in Cyprus.
