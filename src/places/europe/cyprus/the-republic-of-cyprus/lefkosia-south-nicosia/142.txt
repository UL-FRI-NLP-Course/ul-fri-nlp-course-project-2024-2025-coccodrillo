Famagusta Gate | Nicosia (Lefkosia), Cyprus |  Easternmost city gate Famagusta is the most photographed and best-preserved of the three original gates that led into the Old City of Nicosia. Its impressive wooden door and sloping facade open out into a tunnel that leads through the rampart wall. Beyond the tunnel to the right is a small open-air arena, where concerts are held during the summer months.
