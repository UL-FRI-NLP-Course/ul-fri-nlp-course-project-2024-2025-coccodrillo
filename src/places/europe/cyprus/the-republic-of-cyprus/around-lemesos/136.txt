Governor’s Beach | Cyprus, Europe |  Lemesos’ tourist appeal starts 30km east of the city at Governor’s Beach, which features several coves of dark sand contrasting with white, chalky rocks. On the downside, the Vasilikos power station looms 3km to the east, blighting the otherwise seamless sea views. The restaurant here, Panayiotis, is popular for its fish meze.
