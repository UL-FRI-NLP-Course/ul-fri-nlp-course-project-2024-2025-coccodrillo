Cyprus Theatre Museum | Lemesos (Limassol), Cyprus |  This former private collection belonging to an enthusiastic amateur actor offers a fascinating glimpse into the history of theatre in Cyprus through photographs, scale models, costumes, posters and audiovisual exhibits. The collection stretches back to the ancient theatres of the Hellenistic and Roman periods and ends with the current theatre culture in Cyprus, which is happily thriving.
