Archaeological Museum | Lemesos (Limassol), Cyprus |  This museum includes an extensive collection of pottery, and a selection of items dating from neolithic and Chalcolithic times through to Mycenaean pottery. A multitude of terracotta figures on show are thought to be the remains of votive offerings. There is a display of classical pottery, jewellery and oil lamps, as well as curiously modern-looking glass bottles and vials, and a touchingly mundane pair of tweezers. At the other extreme are the Greek and Roman statues from Ancient Amatheus.
Although it pales in comparison to Nicosiaâ€™s Cyprus Museum, this museum is well worth a browse for anyone interested in the region's fascinating history.
