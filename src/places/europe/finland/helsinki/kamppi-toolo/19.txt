Amos Rex | Helsinki, Finland |  Set beneath the iconic 1936 Lasipalatsi building, art museum Amos Rex opened in 2018. Sweeping staircases take you below ground to the exhibition halls where often experimental works bring the traditional, the new and the future together in an intriguing space. Skylights in the polka-dot ceiling jut out above ground in the square behind and give spectators an opportunity to glimpse exhibitions from the outside in.
