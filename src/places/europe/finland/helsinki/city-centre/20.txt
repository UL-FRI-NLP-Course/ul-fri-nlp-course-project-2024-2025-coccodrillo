Kajsaniemi | Helsinki, Finland |  Rambling over 4 hectares in the city centre alongside the north harbour, Töölönlahti, Helsinki's botanic gardens are filled with plants from Finland and other countries on the same latitude, with some 3600 species all up. The gardens' 10 interconnected greenhouses shelter 800 species from all latitudes, and are a wonderfully warm refuge for visitors in the chillier months.
