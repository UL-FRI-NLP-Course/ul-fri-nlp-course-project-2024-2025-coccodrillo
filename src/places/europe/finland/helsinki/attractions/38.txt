Suomenlinna-Museo | Helsinki, Finland |  By the bridge at Suomenlinna that connects Iso Mustasaari and the main island, Susisaari, is Suomenlinna-Museo, a two-level museum covering the history of the fortress. Itâ€™s very information heavy, but provides good background. Displays (with interpretative signs in English) include maps and scale models of ships and the fortress itself. A helpful 25-minute audiovisual display plays every 30 minutes (with multilingual headphones, including an English option). Tickets include entry to the Vesikko submarine.
