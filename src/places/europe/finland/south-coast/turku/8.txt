Taidekappeli | Turku, Finland |  Like the bow of a ship tipped on its end, this unusual structure is perched on a rock and surrounded by forest on Hirvensalo island, 7km south of Turku centre. Looking at its oddly shaped, copper-clad exterior, you wouldn't know it's a chapel â€“ St Henry's Ecumenical Art Chapel, to be precise. But the timber interior feels holy indeed, with its high walls curving up to form a Reuleaux triangle, framing an altar of light. It's spectacular.
