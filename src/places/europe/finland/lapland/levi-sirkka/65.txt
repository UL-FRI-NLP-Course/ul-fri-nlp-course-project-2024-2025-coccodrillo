Samiland | Lapland, Finland |  Attached to the Levi Panorama hotel at the top of the main ski lift, this museum is a Unesco project. The illuminating exhibition gives plenty of good multilingual information on the SÃ¡mi, including details about their traditional beliefs and reindeer herding, accompanied by past and present photographs. Outdoors on the hillside is a collection of traditional kota huts and storage platforms.
