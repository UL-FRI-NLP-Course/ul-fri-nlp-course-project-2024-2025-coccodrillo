Falls of Lora | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  At Connel Bridge, 5 miles north of Oban, the loch joins the sea via a narrow channel partly blocked by an underwater rock ledge. When the tide flows in and out, water pours through this bottleneck, creating spectacular white-water rapids known as the Falls of Lora. Park near the north end of the bridge and walk back into the middle to have a look.
