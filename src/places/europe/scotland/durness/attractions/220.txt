Smoo Cave | North & West Coast, Scotland |  A mile east of the centre of Durness is a path down to Smoo Cave. From the vast main chamber, you can head through to a smaller flooded cavern where a waterfall sometimes cascades from the roof. Thereâ€™s evidence the cave was inhabited about 6000 years ago. You can take a tour to explore a little further into the interior.
