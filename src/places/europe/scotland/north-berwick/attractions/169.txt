Tantallon Castle | Scotland, Europe |  Perched on a cliff 3 miles east of North Berwick is the spectacular ruin of Tantallon Castle. Built around 1350, the red-sandstone fortress was the residence of the Douglas earls of Angus (the Red Douglases), defended on one side by a series of ditches and on the other by an almost sheer drop into the sea. Often attacked, it finally succumbed to an English bombardment in the 17th century â€“ but its battlement views remain as mighty as ever.
