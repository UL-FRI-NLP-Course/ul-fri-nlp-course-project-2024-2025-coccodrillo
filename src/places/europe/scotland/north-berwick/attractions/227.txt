Gullane Bents | Scotland, Europe |  Backing onto genteel Gullane and its manicured golf courses 5 miles east of North Berwick, the long, golden crescent of Gullane Bents has epic views over the Firth of Forth â€“ soak up the best from the (wheelchair-accessible) viewing platform. Its shaggy fringe of dunes and sea buckthorn also shelters a wealth of wildlife, including seabirds and roe deer.
