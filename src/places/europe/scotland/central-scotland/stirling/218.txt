Stirling Old Bridge | Stirling, Scotland |  Dating from the 15th century, this graceful arched stone bridge is one of the oldest in Scotland, now reserved for pedestrians and cyclists only. An earlier wooden bridge, which once lay a short distance upstream, was the site of the Battle of Stirling Bridge (1297), at which William Wallace defeated England's Edward I and laid the ground for Scottish independence.
