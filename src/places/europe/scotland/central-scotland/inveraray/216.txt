Fyne Ales | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  The friendly folk here do a great range of craft beers in this attractive modern brewery off the A83 9 miles northeast of Inveraray. There's a lovely bar-cafe (with outdoor seating) where you can taste them all: the light, citrussy Jarl is a standout. Call ahead to book tours, which run for about 45 minutes. A range of walks tackle the pretty glen from a car park nearby.
