Dean Village | Edinburgh, Scotland |  Set in the valley that runs beneath the Dean Bridge ('dene' is a Scots word for valley), Dean Village was founded as a milling community by the canons of Holyrood Abbey in the 12th century, and by 1700 there were 11 water mills here, grinding grain for flour. One of the old mill buildings has been converted into flats, and the village is now an attractive residential area, with walkways along the river.
