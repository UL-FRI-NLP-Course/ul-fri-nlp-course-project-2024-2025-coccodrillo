Newhaven Harbour | Edinburgh, Scotland |  Newhaven was once a distinctive fishing community whose fishwives tramped the streets of Edinburghâ€™s New Town selling caller herrin (fresh herring) from wicker creels on their backs. Modern development has dispelled the fishing-village atmosphere, but the little harbour still boasts its picturesque lighthouse.
