Gilmerton Cove | Edinburgh, Scotland |  While ghost tours of Edinburgh's underground vaults and haunted graveyards have become a mainstream attraction, Gilmerton Cove remains an off-the-beaten-track gem. Hidden in the southern suburbs, the mysterious 'cove' is a series of subterranean caverns hacked out of the rock, their origin and function unknown. Advance bookings essential through Rosslyn Tours.
