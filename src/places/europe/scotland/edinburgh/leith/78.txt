Biscuit Factory | Leith, Edinburgh |  This recent addition to Leith’s hipster scene is a creative arts hub housed in an old biscuit factory, also home to Edinburgh Gin’s second distillery. Events range from food markets to random club nights. It’s still early days, but other plans include creating 20 studios over two floors, a cafe and bar, and a community garden on the roof.
