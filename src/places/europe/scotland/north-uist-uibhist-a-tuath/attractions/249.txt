Bharpa Langass & Pobull Fhinn | Outer Hebrides, Scotland |  A waymarked path from a car park off the A867, 6 miles southwest of Lochmaddy, leads to the chambered Neolithic burial tomb of Bharpa Langass and the stone circle of Pobull Fhinn (Finnâ€™s People); both are reckoned to be around 5000 years old. There are lovely views over the loch, where you may be able to spot seals and otters.
