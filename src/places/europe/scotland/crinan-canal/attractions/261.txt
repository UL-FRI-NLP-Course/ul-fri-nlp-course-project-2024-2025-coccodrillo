Heart of Argyll Wildlife Organisation | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  This nature centre near the Knapdale beaver project has regular wildlife walks and events; check the website. Drop by the centre for advice on wildlife-spotting; the Knapdale Woods here are great for strolling. One local trail leads around Loch Barnluasgan and up to a viewpoint with perspectives over the Crinan Canal.
