Achamore Gardens | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  Subtropical plants thrive in Gigha's Achamore Gardens, the island's principal sight. Rhododendrons, camellias and azaleas take advantage of the microclimate and set the stage for an enjoyable stroll of an hour or so around the paths. A trust is working hard at the difficult task of maintenance. You'll find the gardens just under a mile south of Ardminish.
