Papa Stronsay | Orkney, Scotland |  Just across the harbour from Whitehall is the small island of Papa Stronsay, where Earl Rognvald Brusason was murdered in 1046. The island is owned by a monastic order, the Transalpine Redemptorists; the monks will provide boat trips across to visit the island by prior arrangement.
