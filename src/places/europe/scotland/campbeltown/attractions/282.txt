Campbeltown Museum & Memorial Garden | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  This museum in the noble library building has a few interesting archaeological artefacts from various periods of history, and canvases by William McTaggart among others. The Memorial Garden in the inner courtyard commemorates Linda McCartney, who is represented by a somewhat spooky statue.
