Bullough Mausoleum | Central Highlands, Scotland |  The only part of the island that still belongs to the Bullough family is this mausoleum in Glen Harris. It's a miniature Greek temple that wouldnâ€™t look out of place on the Acropolis. Lady Bullough was laid to rest here, alongside her husband and father-in-law, in 1967, having died at the age of 98.
