Orkney Brewery | Orkney, Scotland |  The folk here have been producing their brilliant Orcadian beers – Dark Island is a standout, while Skullsplitter lives up to its name – for years now, and this brewery's visitor centre is a great place to come and try them. Tours run regularly from noon to 3pm and explain the brewing process, while, fashionably decked out in local stone, the cafe-bar is atmospheric.
