Unstan Chambered Cairn | Orkney, Scotland |  This atmospheric neolithic tomb, on a smaller scale than nearby Maeshowe, is a site that you may well get to yourself. It's a very tight squeeze down the entrance passage; once inside you can appreciate several different burial compartments divided by vertical stone slabs. The modern roof protects the structure.
