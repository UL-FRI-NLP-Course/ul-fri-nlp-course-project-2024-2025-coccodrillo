Noup Head | Orkney, Scotland |  This bird reserve at Westray's northwestern tip is a dramatic area of sea cliffs, with vast numbers of breeding seabirds from April to July. You can walk here along the clifftops from a car park, passing the impressive chasm of Ramni Geo, and return via the lighthouse access road (4 miles).
