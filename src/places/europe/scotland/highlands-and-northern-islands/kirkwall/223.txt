Kirkjuvagr Orkney Gin | Kirkwall, Scotland |  Opened in 2018, this distillery and visitor centre on the waterfront is a new showcase for this tasty Orkney spirit. Tours run for an hour and include an audiovisual display and a tasting; it's wise to prebook online. There's also a cafe-bar here. At the time of research, it was about to roll out an in-depth day-long tour that would let you create your own gin.
