Longhope Lifeboat Museum | Orkney, Scotland |  At the southern end of Hoy, Longhopeâ€™s former lifeboat launching station holds a small lifeboat museum, centred around one of the old boats itself, the Thomas McCunn, in service from the '30s until 1962. The museum opens on request: call the caretaker to have a look. Donations are much appreciated.
