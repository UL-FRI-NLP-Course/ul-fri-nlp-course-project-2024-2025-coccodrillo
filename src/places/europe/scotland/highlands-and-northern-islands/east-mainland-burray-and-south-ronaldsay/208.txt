Mine Howe | Orkney, Scotland |  On a farm at Tankerness, the mysterious Iron Age site of Mine Howe is an eerie underground chamber, about 1.5m in diameter and 4m high. Its function is unknown; archaeologists from the TV series Time Team carried out a dig here and concluded that it may have had some ritual significance, perhaps as an oracle or shrine. At the time of research it was closed to the public.
