Craigellachie Nature Reserve | The Cairngorms, Scotland |  This reserve is a great place for short hikes across steep hillsides covered in natural birch forest where you can spot wildlife such as the peregrine falcons that nest on the crags from April to July. A trail leads west from Aviemore SYHA and passes under the A9 into the reserve.
