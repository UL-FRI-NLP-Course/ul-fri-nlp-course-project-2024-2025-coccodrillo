Castle Stalker | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  One of Scotland's most spectacularly sited castles, Castle Stalker perches on a tiny offshore island â€“ Monty Python buffs will recognise it as the castle that appears in the final scenes of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Visits are by two-hour guided tour by a family member (book by email or phone), and leave from a boat dock just off the A828. There's a maximum of one a day, so arrange your visit in advance.
