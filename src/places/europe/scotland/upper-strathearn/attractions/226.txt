Earthquake House | Lowland Perthshire & Kinross, Scotland |  This tiny stone building, set on a hillside less than a mile west of Comrie, was the world's first seismic observatory. It was built in 1874 to monitor earth tremors in the vicinity of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs nearby. It's not open to the public, but you can look through the window to see the modern seismometer that now occupies the building.
