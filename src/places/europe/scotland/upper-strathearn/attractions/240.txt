Deil's Cauldron | Lowland Perthshire & Kinross, Scotland |  A mile north of Comrie, the River Lednock cascades out of a deep, wooded gorge and into a circular, rock-girt pool known as the Deil's Cauldron (the Devil's cooking pot). A footpath (signposted Glen Lednock Circular) leads from the car park at the western end of the village to the falls, where wooden steps and walkways lead down to a viewpoint.
