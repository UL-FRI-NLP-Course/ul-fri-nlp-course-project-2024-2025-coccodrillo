Blackness Castle | Scotland, Europe |  Built in the 1440s by the Lord High Admiral of Scotland, this imposing castle juts like the prow of a ship into the Firth of Forth at Blackness, 4 miles northeast of Linlithgow. Its mighty curtain walls have panoramic Forth Bridge views, while the dank pit prison – which flooded twice a day at high tide – offers a less pleasant perspective on fortress life.
