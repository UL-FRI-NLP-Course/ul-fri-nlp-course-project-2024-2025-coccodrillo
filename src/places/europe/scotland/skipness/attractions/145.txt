Skipness Castle | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  Beyond Skipness village rise the substantial remains of 13th-century Skipness Castle, a former possession of the Lords of the Isles. It’s a striking building, composed of dark-green local stone trimmed with contrasting red-brown sandstone from Arran. The tower house was added in the 16th century and was occupied until the 19th century. From the top you can see the roofless, 13th-century St Brendan’s Chapel down by the shore. The kirkyard contains some excellent carved grave slabs.
