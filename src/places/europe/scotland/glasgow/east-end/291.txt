Glasgow Green | Glasgow, Scotland |  Established by the Bishop of Glasgow in the mid-15th century, this likeable flat green space draped along the Clyde is Glasgow's oldest park. It's a venue for strollers, dog walkers and summer festivals. The obelisk in the middle commemorates Nelson and the victory at Trafalgar.
