Glasgow Cross | Glasgow, Scotland |  This junction of five roads is a major Glasgow landmark and indicates the end of Merchant City and beginning of the East End. Standing tall is the Tolbooth Steeple, a clocktower that is all that remains of the 17th-century town hall. Near it is the Mercat Cross, which traditionally marked the place that a market could be held by royal decree, represented here by a unicorn.
