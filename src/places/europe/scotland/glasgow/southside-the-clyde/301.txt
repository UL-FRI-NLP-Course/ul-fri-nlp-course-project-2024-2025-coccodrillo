Queens Park | Glasgow, Scotland |  This Southside landmark was laid out in Victorian times as the city expanded; it's still a major community focus. Kids attempt to feed the ducks, who try to hold their own against the bullying gulls. Elsewhere, there's a glasshouse and pleasant views atop the hill.
