Tall Ship | Glasgow, Scotland |  The magnificent Tall Ship Glenlee, a beautiful three-master launched in 1896, is berthed alongside the Riverside Museum. On board are family-friendly displays about the ship's history, restoration and shipboard life during its heyday. Upkeep costs are high, so donate something, buy the guidebook or have a coffee below decks.
