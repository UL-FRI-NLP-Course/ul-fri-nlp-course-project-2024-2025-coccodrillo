Benmore Botanic Garden | Southern Highlands & Islands, Scotland |  This garden, 7 miles north of Dunoon, contains Scotland's finest collection of flowering trees and shrubs, including impressive displays of rhododendrons and azaleas, and is entered along a spectacular avenue of giant redwoods. A highlight is the Victorian fernery, nestled in an unlikely fold in the crags. The cafe here (which also opens through some of the winter) appeals for lunch or coffee. Buses run between here and Dunoon.
