Minotaur Mural | Agios Nikolaos, Greece |  Walking along the waterfront on Akti Koundourou, keep an eye out for a superb perspective mural depicting the Minotaur on a zigzagging staircase (next to Manolis bike hire). It's a 2018 work by Athens-born artist Manolis Anastasakos, whose fascination with mythology often finds expression in his work.
