Byzantine & Post-Byzantine Collection | Hania, Greece |  In the impressively restored Venetian Church of San Salvatore, this small but fascinating collection of artefacts, icons, jewellery and coins spans the period from AD 62 to 1913. Highlights include a segment of a mosaic floor from an early-Christian basilica, an icon of St George slaying the dragon, and a panel recently attributed to El Greco.
The building has a mixed bag of interesting architectural features from its various occupiers. A combined ticket (â‚¬6) also gives you entry to the archaeological museums of Hania and Kissamos.
