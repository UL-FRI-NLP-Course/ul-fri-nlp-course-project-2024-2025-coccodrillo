Mosque of Kioutsouk Hasan | Hania, Greece |  One of the prettiest and most dominant vestiges of the Turkish era is this dusky-pink multidomed former mosque on the eastern side of the Venetian Harbour. It was built in 1645, making it the oldest Ottoman building in town. It's sometimes open for temporary art exhibits.
