Natural History Museum | Iraklio, Greece |  In an imaginatively recycled power station, a 10-minute walk west from 25 Avgoustou along the waterfront, this museum uses huge dioramas and a terrarium wing to introduce you to the flora and fauna of Crete and the Mediterranean.
Stars of the show include the life-size (5m by 7m) representation of the elephant-like Deinotherium gigantum, the worldâ€™s third-largest land mammal, and the shivering and shaking classroom earthquake simulator.
