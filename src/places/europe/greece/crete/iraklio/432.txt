Venetian Loggia | Iraklio, Greece |  The attractively reconstructed 17th-century loggia by Francesco Morosini was the Venetian version of a gentlemenâ€™s club, where the male aristocracy gathered for drinks and gossip.
On the north side of the building, note the partly preserved relief that once adorned the town's Sagredo Fountain and was incorporated into the loggia during its 1962 reconstruction.
