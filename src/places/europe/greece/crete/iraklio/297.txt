Museum of Christian Art | Iraklio, Greece |  Housed in a 13th-century monastery that was later a mosque, this tiny but fascinating museum features well-displayed historic religious artworks from monasteries around Crete. Paintings, woodcraft, manuscripts and stone carvings are presented in a clear manner with English descriptions. Star exhibits include works by 15th-century icon hagiographer Angelos Akotantos and post-Byzantine painter Michael Damaskinos.
Itâ€™s opposite Agios Minas Cathedral.
