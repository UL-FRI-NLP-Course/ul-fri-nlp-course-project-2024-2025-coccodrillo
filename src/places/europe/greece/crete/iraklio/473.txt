Bembo Fountain | Iraklio, Greece |  Iraklio's first fountain was cobbled together in the 1550s from antique materials, including Venetian coats of arms and a statue of a Roman official found near Ierapetra, and it channelled fresh water into town via an aqueduct running 13km south to Mt Yiouhtas.
The adjacent hexagonal building was originally a pump house added by the Turks.
