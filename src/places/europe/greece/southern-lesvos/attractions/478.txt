Vrana Olive-Press Museum | Lesvos, Greece |  Modestly tucked away in the village of Papados, between Mytilini and south-coast Plomari, this little museum showcases 19th-century steam-powered presses and vintage paintings of a bygone era. It also occupies a bit of Greek literary history – it was built by Nicholas Vranas, grandfather of Greek Nobel Prize–winning poet Odysseus Elytis.
