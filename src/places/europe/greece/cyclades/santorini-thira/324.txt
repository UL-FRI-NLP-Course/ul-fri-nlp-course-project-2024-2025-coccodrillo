Ancient Akrotiri | Santorini, Greece |  In 1967, excavations in the southwest of Santorini uncovered an ancient Minoan city buried deep beneath volcanic ash from the catastrophic eruption of 1613 BC. Housed within a cool, protective structure, wooden walkways allow you to pass through the city. Peek inside three-storey buildings that survived, and see roads, drainage systems and stashes of pottery.
It's best to visit with a guide and to stop by the Museum of Prehistoric Thera before coming here.
