Tomato Industrial Museum | Santorini, Greece |  Tomato processing was a major industry on the island before the earthquake of 1952, and this is a unique look inside an old tomato factory in Vlihada. The video interviews of elderly former factory workers are interesting and the museum is part of the cool Santorini Arts Factory (www.santoriniartsfactory.gr), which hosts exhibitions, concerts and theatre shows; check its programme online.
