Moni Episkopis | Cyclades, Greece |  From the saddle between Kastro and Horio, a surfaced road leads southwest for 5km to Moni Episkopis, under renovation during research time. The remains here are believed to be those of a 3rd-century AD Roman mausoleum that was transformed into a church in the 7th century and a monastery 10 centuries later. A couple of excellent hiking trails start here and one bus per day runs here on summer evenings.
