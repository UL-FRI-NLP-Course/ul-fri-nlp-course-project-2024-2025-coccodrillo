Super Paradise | Mykonos, Greece |  Flashy, trashy and great for people-watching â€“ Super Paradise is Mykonos' most popular gay-friendly beach. The action is split between the glitzy JackieO' Beach Club on the southern headland and the Super Paradise beach bar on the sands.
During the season, a private bus service connects the beach to Hora's Fabrika bus station.
