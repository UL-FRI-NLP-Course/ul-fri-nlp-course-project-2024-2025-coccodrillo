Paradise | Mykonos, Greece |  Clear waters and golden sands make this one of the island's most famous beaches. It's completely lined with noisy beach bars and rows of umbrellas, but the service (particularly at Tropicana) is friendly and attentive. There's a camping resort here, a dive centre, an excellent Indian restaurant and the island's most highly rated club.
Regular buses head here from Hora's Fabrika station.
