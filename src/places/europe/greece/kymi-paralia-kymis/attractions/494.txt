Folklore Museum | Evia, Greece |  Immediately downhill from Kymi's main square, this well-presented museum includes a display honouring Kymi-born Dr George Papanikolaou, inventor of the Pap smear test and pioneer in the early diagnosis of cancer. There are also exhibits on traditional homes, embroidery, ceramics and clothing, including a 19th-century wedding dress.
