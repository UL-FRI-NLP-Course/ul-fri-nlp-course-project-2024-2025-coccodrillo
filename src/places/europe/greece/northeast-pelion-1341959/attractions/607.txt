Church of Agia Marina | Pelion Peninsula, Greece |  The flower-festooned village of Kissos spreads across steep terraces to all sides of this 18th-century church, where the frescoes are considered the finest in the Pelion. Sunday service is from 7am to 11am; at other times, knock on the door to request a look.
