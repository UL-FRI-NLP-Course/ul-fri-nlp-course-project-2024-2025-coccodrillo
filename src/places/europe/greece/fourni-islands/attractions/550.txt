Kampi | Northeastern Aegean Islands, Greece |  A short trek from the main village, this charming little bay with turquoise water has a tiny fishing port and a nice pebbly beach. A beach bar and a taverna come to life in summer. Follow a stone-paved path above the church in Fourni Korseon until you reach the windmills, then descend to the sea.
