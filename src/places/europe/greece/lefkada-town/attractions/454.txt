Moni Faneromenis | Lefkada, Greece |  Set in beautiful hilltop gardens 3km west of town towards Agios Nikitas, Moni Faneromenis was founded in 1634 and rebuilt following a fire in 1886. The ascent is rewarded with magnificent views over town and lagoon.
The complex contains an interesting little museum and – one for the kids – a small zoo with parrots, deer and a few other animals.
