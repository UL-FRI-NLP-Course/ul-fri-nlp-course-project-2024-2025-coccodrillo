Archaeological Museum | Lefkada, Greece |  This excellent museum, west along the waterfront in the modern cultural centre, illuminates island history from the Palaeolithic era to the Romans. Prize exhibits include terracotta ensembles from the 6th century BC depicting a flute player surrounded by dancing nymphs, seen as evidence that a Pan cult once flourished on Lefkada.
