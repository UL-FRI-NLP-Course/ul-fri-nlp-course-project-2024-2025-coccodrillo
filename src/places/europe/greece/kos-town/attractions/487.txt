Archaeological Museum | Kos Town, Greece |  Housed in a superb example of an Italian-era building, located in the central square, the small, but excellent archaeological museum possesses a wealth of sculptures from the Hellenistic to late Roman eras, with a statue of Hippocrates and a 3rd-century-AD mosaic as the star attractions. There are information panels for many of the rooms.
