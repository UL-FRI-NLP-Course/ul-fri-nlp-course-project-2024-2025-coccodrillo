Kypseli Municipal Market | Athens, Greece |  This modernist 1935 market building has been reinvigorated by the city by a range of social projects including the first physical store for the non-profit business Wise Greece (www.en.wisegreece.com), which sells some 2500 local food products. For every item sold, a percentage of the profit goes into a fund to buy food for people in need.
