The Tholos virtual-reality theatre takes you on an interactive tour of the Ancient Agora, Acropolis or Hagia Sophia in Ä°stanbul. There are also temporary exhibitions on different aspects of the ancient world. It's not a tourist spot, but more a place schoolkids go on field trips; call ahead to arrange English narration.
