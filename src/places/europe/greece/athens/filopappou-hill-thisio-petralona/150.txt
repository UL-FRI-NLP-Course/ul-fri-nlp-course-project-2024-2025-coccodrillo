Socrates' Prison | Athens, Greece |  On the slopes of Filopappou Hill, follow the path to this warren of rooms carved into bedrock. It's said to have been the place Socrates was imprisoned in before his trial in 399 BC.
More recently, artefacts from the Acropolis and National Archaeological Museum were hidden here to protect them from Nazi looting during WWII.
