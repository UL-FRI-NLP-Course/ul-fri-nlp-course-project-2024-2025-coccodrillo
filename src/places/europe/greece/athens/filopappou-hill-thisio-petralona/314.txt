Melina Merkouri Cultural Centre | Athens, Greece |  For anyone who loves the Greek tradition of karagiozi (shadow puppets), this free museum is a treat, packed with the creations of master puppeteer Haridimos (Sotiris Haritos). There's very little English signage, but the displays tell their own stories. Upstairs is a mock street scene of 'old Athens', with shop windows of the typesetter, the photo studio, the barber and more.
Call ahead to see if they have a puppet show â€“ there's often one at 11am on Sunday.
