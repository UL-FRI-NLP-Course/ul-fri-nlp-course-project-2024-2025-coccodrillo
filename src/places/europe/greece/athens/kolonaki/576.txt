Hellenic Childrenâ€™s Museum | Athens, Greece |  At this centre, activities encourage children's development and engage the imagination. Exhibits are in Greek only; some activities are suitable for non-Greek speakers and most staff speak English. Children must be supervised. It's in the blocky old Athens Conservatoire building.
