War Museum | Athens, Greece |  This relic of the junta years is a stark architectural statement of the times. But its displays of weapons, maps, armour and models from the Mycenaean civilisation to the present day make an interesting break from the classics and there are some impressive pieces of kit parked around it, including fighter jets and an exact copy of the 1912 Daedalus, Greece's first military aircraft.
