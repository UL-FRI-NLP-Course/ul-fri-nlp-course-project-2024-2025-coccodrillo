Athens Cathedral | Athens, Greece |  This ornate 1862 cathedral is the seat of the archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church of Athens. Far more significant, both historically and architecturally, is the small 12th-century cruciform-style marble Church of Agios Eleftherios next to the cathedral, built of bits and pieces of ancient temples and earlier Christian monuments.
Mass is held at 6.30am on Sundays.
