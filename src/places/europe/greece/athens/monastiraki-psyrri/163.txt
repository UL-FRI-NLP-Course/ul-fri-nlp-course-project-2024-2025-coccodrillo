Mosque of Tzistarakis | Athens, Greece |  Built in 1759, this building on the south side of Monastiraki is one of few surviving examples of a tzami (mosque) in Athens. It has not functioned as a mosque since Independence, except to cater to King Saud of Saudi Arabia when he visited in 1966. Maintained by the Museum of Greek Folk Art, it opens intermittently for temporary exhibitions
