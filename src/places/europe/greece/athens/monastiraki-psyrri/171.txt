Church of Kapnikarea | Athens, Greece |  This small 11th-century church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, stands smack in the middle of the Ermou shopping strip. It was saved from the bulldozers and restored by Athens University. Its dome is supported by four large Roman columns.
Most of the interior frescoes were painted by famous artist Fotis Kontoglou in 1955.
