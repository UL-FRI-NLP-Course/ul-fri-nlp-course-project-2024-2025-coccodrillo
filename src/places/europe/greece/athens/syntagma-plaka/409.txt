Oldest House in Athens | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  Opened after renovations in 2017, the 17th-century Benizelos home is a typical domestic structure from that period, with dirt-floor downstairs rooms with wine and olive presses, and wood-panelled living rooms upstairs. Look for the repurposed classical columns in the gate leading to the backyard, formerly an olive grove. It's a nice free diversion, but note the limited opening hours.
