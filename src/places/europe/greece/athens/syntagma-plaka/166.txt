Bath House of the Winds | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  One of the few remnants of Athens' Ottoman period, this 17th-century hammam (Turkish bath) is also the only intact public bath building in the city â€“ though it unfortunately no longer functions as such. As a museum, though, it's quite attractive and atmospheric, with music, sound and a few projections conjuring its glory days as you stroll through the various rooms.
