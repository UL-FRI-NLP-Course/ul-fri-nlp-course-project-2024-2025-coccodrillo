Kora√Ø 4 | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  When the German military occupied Athens in 1941, it requisitioned the Ethniki Insurance offices and for three years used the two-level basement as holding cells for prisoners, hidden away right in the centre of bustling downtown. The preserved walls of the rooms are scratched and sketched with poignant messages, especially the recurring plea 'I want water'.
