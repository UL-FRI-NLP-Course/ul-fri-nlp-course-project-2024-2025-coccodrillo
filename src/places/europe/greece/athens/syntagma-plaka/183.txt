Church of Agii Theodori | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  This 11th-century church is worth a detour just to see it still existing amid all the modern office buildings. Inside, you'll see a tiled dome and, under years of candle smoke, walls decorated with a pretty terracotta frieze of animals and plants.
