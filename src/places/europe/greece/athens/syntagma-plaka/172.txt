Roman Baths | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  Excavation work to create a ventilation shaft for the metro uncovered the well-preserved ruins of a large Roman bath complex, built in the 3rd century AD where the Ilissos River once ran. A portion is exposed at the edge of the Zappeion, and you can peer down from above.
