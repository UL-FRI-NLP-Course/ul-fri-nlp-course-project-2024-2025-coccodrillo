Museum of Greek Folk Art at 22 Panos | Syntagma & Plaka, Athens |  While the main Museum of Greek Folk Art is being rebuilt (it's scheduled to reopen in 2020), this annexe houses the permanent collection Men & Tools, which is not quite as dry as it sounds. The small display, enhanced by music, is a loving tribute to Greeks' hard labour and refined skills in the pre-industrial era.
Entry is free on Sundays from November to March.
