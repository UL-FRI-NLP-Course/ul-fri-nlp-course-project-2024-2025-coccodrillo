No Land For the Poor Mural | Athens, Greece |  Exarhia is so plastered with graffiti that spotting the better pieces of street art can be a challenge. However there is no missing this gigantic and splendidly executed painting of a sleeping poor and homeless man, by Indonesian-born and Athens-based artist Wild Drawing. See the map on his website for the locations of more of his works around the city.
