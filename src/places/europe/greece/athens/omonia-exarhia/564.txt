Navarino Park | Athens, Greece |  Lest you think anarchism is all about riots and squats: this is a reclaimed parking lot, which locals occupied and planted with greenery in 2009. It's still maintained by the neighbourhood, and flourishes with a creative playground, steadily growing fruit trees and, of course, street art.
