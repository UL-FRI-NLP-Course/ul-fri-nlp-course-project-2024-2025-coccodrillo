Praying Hands Mural | Athens, Greece |  Μanolis Anastasakos and Pavlos Tsakonas, along with students from the Athens School of Fine Arts (ASKT), are responsible for this provocative piece of monumental street art. Inspired by Albrecht Dürer’s Praying Hands, the image has been inverted so that it appears that it is the Lord praying for the people rather than the other way around.
