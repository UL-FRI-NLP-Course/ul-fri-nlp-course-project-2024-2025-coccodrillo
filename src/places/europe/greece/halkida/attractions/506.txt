Old Bridge | Evia, Greece |  Spanning the narrowest point of the Evripos Channel, this sliding drawbridge is the perfect point from which to ponder why the waters here reverse direction every few hours, an event whose full explanation has eluded observers since Aristotle, and was dreaded by ancient mariners. The bridge's original span dates from 410 BC.
