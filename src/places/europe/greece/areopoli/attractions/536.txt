Church of Taxiarches | The Mani, Greece |  On the southern side of Plateia 17 Martiou is this 18th-century church. Its picturesque five-storey bell tower marks it as the most important of Areopoli's many churches. The square is named after the day in 1821 when Mani leaders began the revolution against the Ottoman occupation at this very church.
