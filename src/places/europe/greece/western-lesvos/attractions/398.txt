Moni Ypsilou | Lesvos, Greece |  About 9km west of Andissa, the Byzantine Moni Ypsilou stands atop a solitary peak surrounded by volcanic plains. Founded in the 8th century, this storied place includes a flowering arched courtyard and a small but spectacular museum with antique icons and Byzantine manuscripts. From the top of the monastery walls, you can gaze out over the desolate ochre plains stretched out against the sea.
