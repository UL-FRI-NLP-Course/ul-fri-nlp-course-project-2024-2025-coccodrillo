Myrtos Beach | Kefallonia, Greece |  From the road that zigzags down to it, you'll understand why Myrtos is touted as one of the most breathtaking beaches in all of Greece. From afar it's certainly a stunning sight, with electric-blue waters offset by what appears to be searing-white 'sand' (in reality it's white pebbles). Unfortunately, a scrappy car park rather spoils the idyll. Even so, it's a beautiful spot and once you're in the sea itâ€™s heavenly.
The closest village is Divarata, which has a couple of tavernas, including Alexandros.
