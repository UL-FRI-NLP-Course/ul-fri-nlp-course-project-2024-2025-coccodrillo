Stegna Beach | Rhodes, Greece |  A 3km detour off the main road from the busy town of Archangelos will bring you winding down the coastal hillside to the low-key little resort of Stegna. Sandy, idyllic Stegna Beach stretches for around 1km along the seafront, facing the open sea but still generally tranquil for swimming.
