Grotta Beach | Hora (Naxos), Greece |  This pebbly, stony beach to the north of town is pounded by waves when a northerly is blowing, but is relatively calm in a southerly. This is where the Mycenaean city of Naxos, one of the Aegean regionâ€™s most significant, stood in ancient times. There are ancient remains underwater off the beach.
