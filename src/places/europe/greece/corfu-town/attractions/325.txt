Archaeological Museum | Corfu Town, Greece |  Built in the 1960s, Corfu Town’s Archaeological Museum has finally reopened after nearly a decade of renovations. The result of this work is a modern and well-lit museum (although some of the English labelling is a bit hit and miss) housing some 16,000 pieces found around Corfu. The highlight of the fine collection is a massive gorgon pediment (590–580 BC) from the Temple of Artemis on the nearby Kanoni Peninsula.
