Byzantine Collection of Corfu | Corfu Town, Greece |  This gallery occupies one room of a former gatehouse within the Palaio Frourio. While itâ€™s not to be confused with the superior Antivouniotissa Museum, it does display some attractive frescoes and simple mosaics, while panels describe the early history of Christianity on Corfu.
