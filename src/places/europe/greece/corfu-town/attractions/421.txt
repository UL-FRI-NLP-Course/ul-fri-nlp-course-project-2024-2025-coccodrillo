Serbian Museum of Corfu | Corfu Town, Greece |  Housed in the Serbian Consulate, this small museum tells of how Serbia’s army and government, retreating from the Bulgarians during WWI, were invited by the French occupiers of Corfu to come to the island. Maps, battle plans and photos explain the whole thing, and how they fared during their three-year stay; it’s all oddly intriguing, if rather impenetrable to outsiders.
