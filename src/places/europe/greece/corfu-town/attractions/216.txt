Mon Repos Estate | Corfu Town, Greece |  This park-like wooded estate 2km around the bay south of the Old Town was the site of Corfu’s most important ancient settlement, Palaeopolis. More recently, in 1921, the secluded neoclassical villa that now holds the Museum of Palaeopolis was the birthplace of Prince Philip of Greece, who went on to marry Britain's Princess Elizabeth (now the current Queen). Footpaths lead through the woods to ancient ruins, including those of a Doric temple atop a small coastal cliff.
It takes half an hour to walk to Mon Repos from town, or you can catch bus 2a from the Spianada (€1.20, every 20 minutes). Bring a picnic and plenty of water; there are no shops nearby.
