Durrell Memorial Gardens | Corfu Town, Greece |  A pretty park and flower garden dedicated to writer brothers Lawrence and Gerald Durrell (Gerald also became a world-renowned naturalist and conservationist), who, through their books describing their idyllic life in Corfu in the years leading up to WWII, each, unwittingly, did so much to put this island on the tourist radar.
