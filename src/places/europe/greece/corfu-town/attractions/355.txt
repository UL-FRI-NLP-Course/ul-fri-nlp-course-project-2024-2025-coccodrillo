Menekrates Funeral Monument | Corfu Town, Greece |  A small circular tomb, constructed using stone slabs during the 6th century BC, stands not far south of the Old Town. While not open to visitors, itâ€™s clearly visible from the street. A 10-verse inscription identifies it as a monument to Menekrates, an ambassador from Corfu who died at sea, while the splendid Lion of Menekrates, which was found nearby, is now in the Archaeological Museum.
