Corfu Reading Society | Corfu Town, Greece |  Although thereâ€™s no obvious sign on this grand cream-and-white villa, anyone is welcome to climb its external staircase and settle down with a book in the library of the Corfu Reading Society. Founded in 1836, the oldest cultural institution in modern Greece holds 30,000 volumes in several languages, mostly devoted to the Ionian Islands.
It also displays paintings, prints and maps, and hosts concerts and lectures.
