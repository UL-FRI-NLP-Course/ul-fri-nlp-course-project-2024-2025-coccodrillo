Turkish Bath | Chios, Greece |  With its bubble-like cupolas pierced to let in gentle shafts of light, this classic early-18th-century hammam (Turkish bath) was built as a charitable institution by the Ottomans for the Turkish population of the kastro (castle). After the Turks were expelled in 1922, the building fell into disrepair, but was restored as a museum in 2011. Sadly, it no longer performs its original function.
