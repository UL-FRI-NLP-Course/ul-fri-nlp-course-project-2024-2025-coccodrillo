Gerakas Beach | Zakynthos, Greece |  The best beach in the south, Gerakas is a strand of fine sand that faces the Bay of Laganas. It's also a crucial turtle-nesting site, so visitor numbers are restricted, and all access is forbidden between dusk and dawn from May to October; conservation advice is displayed near the access path.
