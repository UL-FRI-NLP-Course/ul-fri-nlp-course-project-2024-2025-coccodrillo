Mausoleum of Inousses | Chios, Greece |  In the leafy courtyard of the Church of Agia Paraskevi stands the Mausoleum of Inousses, where the island’s ship-owning dynasties have endowed the tombs of their greats with huge chambers, marble sculptures and miniature churches. It’s a melancholy, moving place and speaks volumes about the worldly achievements and self-perception of the extraordinary natives of these tiny islands.
