Porto Katsiki | Lefkada, Greece |  The once-spectacular beach at Porto Katsiki, near the island's southwestern corner, sustained major earthquake damage in 2015. As the debris washes away, it has begun to heal, but the precarious walkway that formerly crossed to the adjoining headland lies in ruins. The beach remains accessible by road.
