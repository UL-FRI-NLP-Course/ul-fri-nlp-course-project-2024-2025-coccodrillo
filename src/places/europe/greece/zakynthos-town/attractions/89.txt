Byzantine Museum | Zakynthos, Greece |  This magnificent museum of ecclesiastical art is housed in a beautifully restored building on the central waterfront plaza. Almost everything here was rescued – by volunteer sailors! – in the immediate aftermath of the 1953 earthquake, with displays including entire church interiors, and frescoes arranged in a replica of the 16th-century monastery of St Andreas.
