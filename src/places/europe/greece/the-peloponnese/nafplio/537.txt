Arvanitia Beach | Nafplio, Greece |  This small pebble beach is just five minutesâ€™ walk south of town, tucked beside the Akronafplia fortress, past the Land Gate. It's a nice place for a sunset bathe, with great views. For a scenic stroll, take the blustery, cactus-adorned path that skirts the headland from the bottom of the promenade.
