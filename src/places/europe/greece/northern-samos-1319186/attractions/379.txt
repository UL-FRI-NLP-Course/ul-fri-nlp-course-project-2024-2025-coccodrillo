Art in the Port | Samos, Greece |  Previously devoid of any special charms, the island's second capital has reinvented itself by inviting a group of internationally acclaimed street artists to use its many derelict storehouses and industrial facilities as canvasses, thus filling the dull landscape with large surreal images and a even couple of installations. Most of these can be seen in the port area while you are waiting for the next ferry.
