Castello Rosso | Evia, Greece |  The ruins of this 11th-century Byzantine fortress – later occupied by the Franks, Venetians and Ottomans – lie a 1km walk uphill from riverside Myli, 4km north of Karystos. The aqueduct behind the castle once carried water from the mountain springs to the Bourtzi in Karystos.
