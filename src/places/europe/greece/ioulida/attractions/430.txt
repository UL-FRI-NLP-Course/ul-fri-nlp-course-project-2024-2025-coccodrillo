Archaeological Museum of Kea | Cyclades, Greece |  The most intriguing artefacts displayed at this well-presented museum were ancient even before Kea's four archaic city-states were formed. The 13 terracotta figurines of bare-breasted women are the best preserved of 50 recovered from a temple at Agia Irini (Vourkari Bay), dating from between 3300 and 1100 BC. Were they goddesses, priestesses or devotees? Nobody knows.
