Museum of Folk Art | Pelion Peninsula, Greece |  To find out what the Pelion’s historical mansions looked like in their prime – before being transformed into luxurious guesthouses – follow a circuitous 100m footpath down from the main square to reach this fascinating museum. Each of the three floors focuses on their original uses – the topmost as summer quarters, the middle for winter, and the lowest for the grandparents – while photos and artefacts recall village life and local history.
