Kania Beach | Dodecanese, Greece |  A gorgeous little slip of a beach with the island's best beach taverna. Sunbeds are free if you consume cuisine and drinks. The waters here seem even clearer than the rest of the island. If that's possible. It's a hilly and unshaded 2.5km hike north from the village, or the local bus does a couple of trips.
