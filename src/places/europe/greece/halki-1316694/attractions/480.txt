Pondamos Beach | Dodecanese, Greece |  Pretty little Pondamos Beach is lapped by the turquoise waters of a crescent bay 15 minutes' walk up and over the hill west of Emborios. The only way to get a comfortable shaded spot is to rent a sunbed alongside Nickâ€™s Taverna, where separate sections serve good seafood meals, and drinks and snacks.
