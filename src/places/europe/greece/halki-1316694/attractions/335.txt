Horio | Dodecanese, Greece |  A stiff switchback climb along the road from Pondamos Beach leads up through Halki’s fertile central valley to Horio. This picturesque ruin was originally the island’s main village, hidden away to escape the eyes of roving pirates. A freshly cobbled footpath heads up to the battlements of the Knights of St John Castle that once protected it. Pass through its forbidding gateway to see a restored chapel and amazing long-range views.
