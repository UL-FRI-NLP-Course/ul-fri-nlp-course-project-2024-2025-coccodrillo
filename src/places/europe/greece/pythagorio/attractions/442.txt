Castle of Lykourgos Logothetis | Samos, Greece |  Samians took the lead locally in the 1821 War of Independence, and this castle, built in 1824 by resistance leader Logothetis, is the major relic of that turbulent time. Itâ€™s situated on a hill at the southern end of Metamorfosis Sotiros, near the car park. The city walls once extended from here to the Evpalinos Tunnel.
