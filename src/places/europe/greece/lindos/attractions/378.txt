St Paul's Bay | Lindos, Greece |  A short walk from the southern end of Lindos village, St Paulâ€™s Bay is an all-but-circular inlet that's only open to the Aegean via a slender gap in the rocks. Its tiny sheltered beach, caressed by turquoise waters, is a supremely tranquil place to swim, but does get very crowded in peak season.
Local tradition has it that St Paul sought refuge here in 57AD, when his ship was fleeing a storm at sea.
