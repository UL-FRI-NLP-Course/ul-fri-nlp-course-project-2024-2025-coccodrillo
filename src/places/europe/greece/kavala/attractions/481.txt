Castle | Macedonia, Greece |  Surmounting Kavala's historic peninsula of Panagia, this picturesque fortress was built on the foundations of a Byzantine acropolis destroyed in 1391. Dating mostly to the early 15th century, it offers great views of the city and houses an open-air theatre and a small cafe selling ice cream and other rewards for the steep climb to get here.
