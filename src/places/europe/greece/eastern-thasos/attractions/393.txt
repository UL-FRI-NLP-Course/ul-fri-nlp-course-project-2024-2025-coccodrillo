Panagia | Thasos, Greece |  This inland village just south of Limenas is nothing if not photogenic. Its characteristic architecture includes stone-and-slate rooftops and the elegant blue-and-white domed and icon-rich Church of the Kimisis tou Theotokou (Church of the Dormition of the Virgin). To reach this peaceful quarter, follow the sound of rushing spring water upwards along a stone path heading inland.
