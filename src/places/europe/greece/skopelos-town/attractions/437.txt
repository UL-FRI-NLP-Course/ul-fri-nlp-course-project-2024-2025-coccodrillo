Vakratsa Mansion | Skopelos, Greece |  Housed in a doctor's 18th-century mansion, Vakratsa displays medical instruments, books, clothes and furniture of the era and is well worth seeing for the window it offers on to middle-class Greek life in the 19th century. It's near the middle of the waterfront, 100m inland from the Ploumisti shop, behind a tall white wall.
