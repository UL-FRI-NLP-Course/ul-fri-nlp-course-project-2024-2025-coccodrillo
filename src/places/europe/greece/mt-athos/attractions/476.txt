Moni Iviron | Macedonia, Greece |  Founded by Georgian monks in the 10th century, this monastery enjoyed 16th-century prosperity, which accounts for its collection of more than 2000 manuscripts, including 100 rare Georgian-language parchments. Impressive frescoes are a further legacy of these fat times, while a revered icon of the Virgin Portaitissa is thought to work miracles.
