Theopetra Cave | Meteora, Greece |  Theopetra Cave, 7km southeast of Kalambaka, has been closed to visitors since 2016 due to the fear of landslides. Its first human occupation has been dated to 130,000 years ago; it used to be possible to explore its archaeological story along specially constructed walkways. The site is not expected to reopen, but ask locally just in case.
