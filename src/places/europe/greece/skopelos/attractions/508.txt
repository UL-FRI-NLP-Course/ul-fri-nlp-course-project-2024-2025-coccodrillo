Agios Ioannis | Skopelos, Greece |  The small, impossibly scenic cragtop chapel of Agios Ioannis, surrounded by the shimmering Aegean 5.5km east of Glossa, is famous for having played the wedding venue in the 2008 Skopelos-starring movie Mamma Mia! Around 200 steps climb up the cliffs.
There's a small grey-pebble beach below.
