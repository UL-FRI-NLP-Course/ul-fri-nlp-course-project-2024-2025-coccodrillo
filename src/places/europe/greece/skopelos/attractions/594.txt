Moni Evangelistrias | Skopelos, Greece |  Built in 1712 on the site of a Byzantine predecessor, Evangelistrias basks in superb views across the coast, but its main prize is a gilded iconostasis containing an 11th-century icon of the Virgin Mary. It's 3.5km east of Skopelos Town and looked after by just one nun.
