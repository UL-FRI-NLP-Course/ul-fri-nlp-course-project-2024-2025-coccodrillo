Temple of St Barbara | Epiros, Greece |  This little chapel is really an excuse for a pleasant short walk, about 30 minutes along a level path. Konitsa's local religious hero, St Paisios of Athos, used to pray here as a teenager. The path starts off the sharp turn above Gerakofolia guesthouse. From the chapel, a less-well-marked trail heads downhill to the landmark Konitsa Bridge.
