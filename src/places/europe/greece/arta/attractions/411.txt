Archaeological Museum | Epiros, Greece |  This museum is a gem: a fine collection, clearly presented, in a manageable space that's seldom busy. It focuses primarily on the ancient city of Ambracia, from its foundation in the 7th century BC to 29 BC, when Nikopolis became the new capital of Epiros. Displays cover the ancient city's musical traditions and burial practices, including elaborately carved marble slabs from graves.
