Kohilari Beach | Kos, Greece |  This beach is for those who want a nature-based experience on a remote strip and small dunes behind. It is also for people who don't mind wind. This is the spot for wind-surfing and kite-surfing. Waves make an appearance here, too, depending on the tides. In high season, gear equipment may be available.
