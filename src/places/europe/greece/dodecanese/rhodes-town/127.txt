Palace of the Grand Master | Rhodes Town, Greece |  From the outside, this magnificent castle-like palace looks much as it did when erected by the 14th-century Knights Hospitaller. During the 19th century, however, it was devastated by an explosion, so the interior is now an Italian reconstruction, completed in the '18th year of the Fascist Era' (1940). Dreary chambers upstairs hold haphazard looted artworks, so the most interesting sections are the twin historical museums downstairs, one devoted to ancient Rhodes and the other to the islandâ€™s medieval history.
The ancient section holds some lovely pottery from the 6th century BC, along with all sorts of everyday domestic objects and even glassware.
