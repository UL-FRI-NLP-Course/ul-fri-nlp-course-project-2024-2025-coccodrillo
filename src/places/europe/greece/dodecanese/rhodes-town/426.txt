Kahal Shalom Synagogue | Rhodes Town, Greece |  Built in 1577, and featuring a fine black-and-white pebble-mosaic floor, Kahal Shalom Synagogue is the oldest synagogue in Greece. A commemorative plaque honours the many local Jews who perished under the Nazis. It’s still a place of worship and pilgrimage, while its former women’s gallery now houses the Jewish Museum of Rhodes.
