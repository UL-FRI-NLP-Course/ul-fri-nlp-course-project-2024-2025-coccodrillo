Modern Greek Art Museum â€“ Old Almshouse | Rhodes Town, Greece |  In a prime location at the upper end of the Old Town, this small adjunct to the four-part Modern Greek Art Museum is easily mistaken for the entrance to the Sissitio restaurant with which it shares a courtyard. Actually, though, the gallery occupies the disused 14th-century church to the left, and is used for temporary exhibitions.
