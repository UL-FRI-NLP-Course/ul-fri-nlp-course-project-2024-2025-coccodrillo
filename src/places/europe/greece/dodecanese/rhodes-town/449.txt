House of Djem | Rhodes Town, Greece |  Glass panels set in the floor of this thoroughly excavated medieval structure expose columns that once lined one of Rhodes’ main Roman streets. Local lore has it that later occupants included Djem, the rebel brother of the Ottoman sultan, in the late 15th century.
Sadly, the finds are too poorly explained to hold most visitors’ interest for long.
