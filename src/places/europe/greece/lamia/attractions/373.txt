Gorgopotamos Railway Bridge | Central Greece, Greece |  On 25 November 1942, in one of the greatest acts of sabotage of WWII, a combined Greek and British guerrilla force blew up the Gorgopotamos Railway Bridge, 10km southwest of Lamia. Designed to delay the German advance, the spectacular attack brought the Greek Underground to world attention, and forced the Germans to divert resources away from the Russian front. A reconstructed bridge now spans the deep ravine.
