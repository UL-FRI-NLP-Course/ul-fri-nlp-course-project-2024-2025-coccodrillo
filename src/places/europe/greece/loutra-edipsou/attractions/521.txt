Loutron Beach | Evia, Greece |  The town beach, opposite the opulent Thermae Sylla spa hotel at the south end of town, heats up year-round thanks to the toasty thermal waters that spill into the bay, surfacing nearby at up to 80Â°C and cascading down to the sea. There are a few natural pools to laze in.
