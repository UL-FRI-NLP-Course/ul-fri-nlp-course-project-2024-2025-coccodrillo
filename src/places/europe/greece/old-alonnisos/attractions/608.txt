Megalos Mourtias Beach | Alonnisos, Greece |  From just east of Old Alonnisos, a steep road leads 2km downhill to popular Megalos Mourtias, a beautiful enclosed curve of pebbles with a couple of restaurants and apartments, a few sun loungers and umbrellas, and great views of Evia looming in the distance.
