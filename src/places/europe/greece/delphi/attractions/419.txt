Sikelianos Museum | Delphi, Greece |  Fans of Greek drama should head to this intimate 1920s mansion-turned-museum, which overlooks Delphi both ancient and modern. It's dedicated to Greek poet Angelos Sikelianos and his American-born wife Eva Palmer, who jointly reinvented Delphi as a modern Greek centre for drama and the arts. The museum displays intriguing photos of their attempts to recreate ancient festivals.
