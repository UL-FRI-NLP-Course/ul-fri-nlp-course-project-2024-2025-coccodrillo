Moni Panagia Spiliotissa | Zagorohoria, Greece |  This now-unused monastery was erected against a massive rock in 1665. The building is usually closed (unless it's the Friday after Easter), but there is a striking external fresco, and it's a lovely 10-minute walk through a fairy-tale forest of moss-covered trees. Look for the parking area downhill from Aristi, on the west side of the road, south of the river crossing.
