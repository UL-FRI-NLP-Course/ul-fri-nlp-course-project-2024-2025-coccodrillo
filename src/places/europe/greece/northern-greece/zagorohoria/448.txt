Kokkori Bridge | Zagorohoria, Greece |  Set between two sheer cliffs below the village of Koukouli, this is one of the most picturesque of the Zagorohoria's stone bridges. It was first built in 1750, and has been kept in excellent repair ever since. The small arch cut into one side of the bridge is for water overflow if the river runs high; otherwise the water pressure would weaken the structure.
