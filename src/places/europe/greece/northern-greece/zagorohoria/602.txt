Plakida Bridge | Zagorohoria, Greece |  A stone-paved trail leads down from the roadside parking area to this stone bridge, one of the prettiest in the Zagori region and a rarity in its triple-arched design, which makes it look a bit like a caterpillar inching over the Vo√Ødomatis. It was built in 1814.
