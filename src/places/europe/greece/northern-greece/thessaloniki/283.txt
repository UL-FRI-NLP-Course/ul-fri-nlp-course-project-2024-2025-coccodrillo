Church of the Panagia Achiropiitos | Thessaloniki, Greece |  This basilica-style 5th-century Byzantine church, built over Roman baths and one of the oldest in Greece, has notable mosaics and frescoes. The name, meaning ‘made without hands’, refers to a miraculous 12th-century appearance of an icon of the Virgin. The first of Thessaloniki's churches to be transformed into a mosque under Ottoman rule, its transition is marked by a marble column on the western side bearing the inscription 'Sultan Murad Conquered Thessaloniki in 833', recounting Murad II's victory in 1430.
