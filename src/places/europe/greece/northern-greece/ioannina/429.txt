Municipal Ethnographic Museum | Ioannina, Greece |  Set inside the Aslan Pasha Mosque (1619), the museum exhibits local costumes and period photographs, along with tapestries and prayer shawls from Ioannina's Jewish community, which numbered some 7000 people at its peak in the 19th century. The grounds of the mosque (free to enter during museum hours) include a ruined madrasa and idyllic lake views from this high point.
