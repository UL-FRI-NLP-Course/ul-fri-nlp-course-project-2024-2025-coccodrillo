Byzantine Museum | Ioannina, Greece |  This museum presents early Christian and Byzantine art, pottery, coins and silverware, plus post-Byzantine icons and manuscripts, early Venetian-produced Greek books and ornate silver jewellery boxes with cloisonné enamel. Textual accompaniments detail Ioannina’s history from the 4th to the 17th century. A plaque at the corner of the building memorialises Ioannina's Jews, deported and killed by the Nazis in 1944.
