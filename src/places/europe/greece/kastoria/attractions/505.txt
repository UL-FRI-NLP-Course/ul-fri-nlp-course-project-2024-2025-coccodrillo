Church of Agioi Anargyroi | Macedonia, Greece |  Best guesses date this three-aisle Byzantine basilica, perhaps Kastoria's most beautiful, to the late-10th or early-11th centuries. The external walls are composed of bricks decorated with diamonds, suns and other patterns, while the interior is adorned with fine frescoes of the Passion of Christ and the martyrdom of saints.
