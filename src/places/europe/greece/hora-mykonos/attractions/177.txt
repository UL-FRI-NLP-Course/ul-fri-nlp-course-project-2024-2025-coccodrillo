Panagia Paraportiani | Hora (Mykonos), Greece |  Built between the 15th and 17th centuries, Mykonos’ most famous church comprises four small chapels – plus another on an upper storey reached by an exterior staircase. It’s usually locked, but the fabulously photogenic whitewashed, rock-like exterior is the drawcard.
