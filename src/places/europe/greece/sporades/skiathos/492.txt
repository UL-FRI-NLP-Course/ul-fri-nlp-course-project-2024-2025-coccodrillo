Kehria Beach | Skiathos, Greece |  Secluded little creamy-white Kehria lies hidden along the north coast down a steep dirt track (4WD recommended), 7km northwest of Skiathos Town. The sparkling turquoise cove is hemmed in by low rocky cliffs and swirls of pines and olive trees, and there's a fab beachfront taverna with sunbeds.
