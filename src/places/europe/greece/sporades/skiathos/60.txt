Koukounaries Beach | Skiathos, Greece |  Framed by electric-green pine trees, two forested headlands and a small salt-water wetland, Koukounaries' silky 1200m-long sweep of bleach-blonde sand is the island's (and one of the country's) most sparklingly beautiful, with beach bars, sunbeds (€8) and water sports creating a buzzy vibe. The beach gets completely packed in summer – but that's half the fun. The whole area is a protected nature reserve.
