Lynn Museum | Norfolk, England |  High points here include a large hoard of Iceni gold coins and the Seahenge Gallery, which tells the story behind the construction and preservation of the early Bronze Age timber circle, which survived for 4000 years, despite being submerged on the Norfolk shoreline â€“ it was only discovered in 1998. The exhibits include a life-size replica of the monument, which you can stand inside.
