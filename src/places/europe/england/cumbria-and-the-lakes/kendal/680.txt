Abbot Hall Art Gallery | The Lake District, England |  After a three-year closure, Kendal's fine-art gallery will reopen to the public on May 20, 2023. It houses one of the northwest's best collections of 18th- and 19th-century art. It's especially strong on portraiture and Lakeland landscapes: look out for works by David Hockney, John Ruskin and local boy George Romney, who was born in Dalton-in-Furness in 1734 and became a sought-after portraitist, as well as a key figure in the 'Kendal School'.
Look out for signposts as you head south along Kirkland Rd.
