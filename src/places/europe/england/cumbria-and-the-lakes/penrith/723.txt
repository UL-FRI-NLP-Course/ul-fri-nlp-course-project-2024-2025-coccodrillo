Rheged | Cumbria & the Lakes, England |  Cunningly disguised as a Lakeland hill 2 miles west of Penrith, this visitor centre houses an IMAX cinema and temporary exhibitions. There's also a large retail hall selling Cumbrian foodstuffs and souvenirs. Local chef Peter Sidwell runs cooking classes and is also responsible for the cafe menu.
Its curious name comes from the ancient Celtic kingdom that covered much of what is now modern Cumbria.
