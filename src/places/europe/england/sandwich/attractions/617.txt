Guildhall Museum | Kent, England |  Sandwich’s small but thorough museum is a good place to start exploring the town. The exhibition space was fully renovated in 2017 to house a copy of the Magna Carta, accidentally discovered in Sandwich's archives in 2015. Other exhibitions examine the town’s rich past as a Cinque Port, its role in various wars, and the gruesome punishments meted out to felons, fornicators and phoney fishers.
