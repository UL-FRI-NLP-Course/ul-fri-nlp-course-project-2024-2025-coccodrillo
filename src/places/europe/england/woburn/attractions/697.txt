Woburn Safari Park | Oxford & the Cotswolds, England |  Sprawling across 150 hectares, the country's largest drive-through animal reserve can only be visited in your own car (so long as it’s not a convertible!). Animals such as rhinos, tigers, lions, elephants and giraffes – grouped into separate enclosures, for obvious reasons – will approach your car, or, if they’re monkeys, climb on top of it. The 'foot safari' area holds sea lions, penguins, meerkats and lemurs.
