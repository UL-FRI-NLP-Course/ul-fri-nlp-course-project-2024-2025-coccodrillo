Church of St Peter & St Paul | The Cotswolds, England |  The grandeur and complexity of this masterpiece of the Cotswold Perpendicular style testifies to its wool-era wealth. Although the chancel and 30m tower date from the 14th century, it was extensively reworked during the 15th-century wool boom. A modern highlight is the 1964 stained-glass window depicting Christ in Glory, behind the altar, while earlier treasures include an unusual 14th-century font.
