Broadway Museum & Art Gallery | The Cotswolds, England |  Set in a magnificent 17th-century coaching inn, Broadway’s town museum has close links with Oxford’s prestigious Ashmolean Museum. Its fascinating displays of local crafts, art and antiques, and its stimulating temporary exhibitions, draw exclusively on the Ashmolean collection, so the quality is consistently high. Paintings in the sumptuous upstairs galleries include 18th-century works by Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough.
