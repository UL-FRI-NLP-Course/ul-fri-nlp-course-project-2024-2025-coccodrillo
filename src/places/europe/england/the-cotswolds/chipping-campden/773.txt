St Jamesâ€™ Church | The Cotswolds, England |  Built in Perpendicular Gothic style in the late 15th century using wool-trade profits, this imposing church boasts a splendid tower and some graceful 17th-century monuments. One of the earliest priest vestments on record, dating back to around 1400, is screened behind a curtain inside. The remarkable row of almshouses along Church St a short walk south was constructed in 1612.
