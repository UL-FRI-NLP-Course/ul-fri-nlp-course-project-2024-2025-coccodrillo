Christ Church Meadow | Oxford, England |  Christ Church Meadow, a lush expanse bordered by the Cherwell and Thames (or Isis) rivers, stretches away south and east of Christ Church. It's ideal for taking a leisurely half-hour walk around the perimeters, though its central swathe is fenced off to hold the collegeâ€™s resident herd of longhorn cattle. The Broad Walk, leading east from the college to the Cherwell, dates from the 17th century.
