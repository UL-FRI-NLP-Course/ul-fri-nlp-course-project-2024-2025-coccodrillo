St Edmund Hall | Oxford, England |  Founded at some point before 1317, St Edmund Hall is the sole survivor of Oxford’s original medieval halls, the teaching institutions that preceded the colleges. ‘Teddy Hall’ to residents, it became a college itself in 1957, and holds a chapel decorated by William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. Mohawk chief Oronhyatekha studied here in 1862.
