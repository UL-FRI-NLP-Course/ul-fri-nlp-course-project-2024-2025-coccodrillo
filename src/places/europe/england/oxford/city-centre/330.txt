Queen's College | Oxford, England |  Known for its musical excellence, this college is steeped in esteem and heritage. Although founded in 1341, its main claims to architectural fame are the wonderful examples of neoclassical architecture from the 17th and 18th centuries. Enter from High St, and you're met by the large green quad surrounded by uniform stone arches. If you get a chance, watch the college choir perform on site.
