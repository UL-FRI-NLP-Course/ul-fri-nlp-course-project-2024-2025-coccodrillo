Uley Bury | The Cotswolds, England |  Englandâ€™s largest Iron Age hill fort, dating from around 300 BC, sprawls across 13 (overgrown) hectares above Uley. A 1.1-mile perimeter track leads around its ramparts, with fabulous views over Uley and the Severn Vale. A steep footpath climbs up to the bury from the village church, while drivers can walk 100m here along an unsigned 100m track from a small car park on the B4066, 1 mile north of Uley.
From the car park, you can also follow the Cotswold Way a short distance north to Uley Long Barrow, a 3500 BC burial mound.
