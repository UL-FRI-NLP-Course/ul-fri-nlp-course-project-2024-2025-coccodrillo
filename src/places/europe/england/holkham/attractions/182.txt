Holkham National Nature Reserve | Norfolk, England |  Beach, dunes, salt marsh, grazing marsh, pinewoods and scrub – a high number of habitats pack into 37-sq-km Holkham Reserve. It's easily accessed from the car park at Lady Anne’s Dr in Holkham village. From there, ribboning pathways lead through forests via bird hides and on to an expansive, pristine shore.
