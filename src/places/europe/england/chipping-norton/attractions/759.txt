Rollright Stones | The Cotswolds, England |  Linked by a footpath through open fields, the ancient Rollright Stones stand to either side of an unnamed road 4 miles north of Chipping Norton. The most remarkable, the Kingâ€™s Men, consist of the weathered remnants of a stone circle that surrounded a Neolithic ceremonial centre in around 2500 BC, while the taller King Stone probably marked a Bronze Age cemetery, a millennium later.
