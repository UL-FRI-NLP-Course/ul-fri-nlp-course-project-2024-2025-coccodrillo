St Mary & All Saints Church | The Midlands & the Marches, England |  Chesterfield is worth a visit to see the astonishing crooked spire that rises atop St Mary and All Saints Church. Dating from 1360, the 68m-high spire is twisted in a right-handed corkscrew that leans several metres southwest. It's the result of the lead casing on the south-facing side having buckled in the sun. Spire tours lasting 45 minutes take you up into the tower. Tour times are posted inside the front door from Monday to Saturday, or phone ahead to check.
