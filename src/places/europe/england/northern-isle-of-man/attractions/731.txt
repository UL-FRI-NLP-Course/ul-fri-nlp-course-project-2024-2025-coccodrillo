Grove Museum of Victorian Life | Isle of Man, England |  This imposing house was built in the mid-19th century by Liverpool shipping merchant Duncan Gibb as a summer retreat for himself and his family. It has been maintained pretty much as it was in its Victorian heyday, and you can wander through its period rooms â€“ and even learn what it was like to be a scullery maid! The house was occupied by the Gibb family until the 1970s. It's on the edge of Ramsey.
