Plymouth Hoe | Plymouth, England |  Francis Drake supposedly spied the Spanish fleet from this grassy headland overlooking Plymouth Sound (the city's wide bay); the bowling green on which he continued to finish his game after the sighting was probably where his statue now stands. The wide villa-backed promenade features scores of war memorials.
