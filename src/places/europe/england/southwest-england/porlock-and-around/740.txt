Holnicote Estate | Exmoor National Park, England |  The 50-sq-km Holnicote Estate sweeps southeast out of Porlock, taking in a string of impossibly pretty villages. Picturesque Bossington leads to charming Allerford and its 15th-century packhorse bridge. The biggest village, Selworthy, offers eye-catching Exmoor views, a cafe, a shop, and cob-and-thatch cottages clustering around the village green.
