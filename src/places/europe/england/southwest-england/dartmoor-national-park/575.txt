Grimspound | Dartmoor National Park, England |  The remains of 24 Bronze Age houses (often called huts) dot a sprawling 1.45-hectare site that is encircled by an arching 1.5m-high and 7m-wide perimeter wall. It's thought prehistoric peoples enclosed the land for a summer encampment. You can stroll around and into the huts, where knee-high walls give a sense of the structure. Also look out for the stone paving beside the southeast entrance.Grimspound is 6 miles southwest of Moretonhampstead, beside a minor road leading off the B3212.
