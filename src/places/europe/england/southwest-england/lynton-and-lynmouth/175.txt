Cliff Railway | Exmoor National Park, England |  This extraordinary piece of Victorian engineering sees two cars, linked by a steel cable, descend and ascend the steeply sloping cliff face according to the weight of water in the cars’ tanks. All burnished wood and polished brass, it’s been running since 1890 and makes for an unmissable ride.
A history display at the Lynmouth station details the story of the railway's ingenious creators.
