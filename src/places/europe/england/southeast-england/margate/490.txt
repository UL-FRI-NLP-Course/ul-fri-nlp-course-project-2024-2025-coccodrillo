Dreamland | Kent, England |  Given the kiss of life using lottery and council funds, Margateâ€™s famous amusement park has come back to life after many years of lying derelict and stop-start renovation. The main attraction here is the so-called Scenic Railway, a 1920s heritage-listed wooden roller coaster that was rebuilt after an arson attack in 2008. But there are plenty of other period rides and attractions to keep adults and kiddies thrilled, some shipped in from other defunct, 20th-century amusement parks across the country.
On top of funfare rides, Dreamland is now an event venue attracting acts big and small.
