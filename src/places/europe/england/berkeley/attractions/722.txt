Dr Jenner’s House | Oxford & the Cotswolds, England |  This beautiful Queen Anne–style house, alongside Berkeley Castle, honours the life and work of Edward Jenner (1749–1823), the country doctor who discovered the principle of vaccination and fundamentally changed the lives of everyone on earth. Jenner performed the first smallpox vaccination here in 1796, on his gardener’s eight-year-old son; the disease has now been eradicated from the entire planet.
