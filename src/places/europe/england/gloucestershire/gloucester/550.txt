Tailor of Gloucester Museum & Shop | Oxford & the Cotswolds, England |  Tucked into a narrow lane opposite the cathedral, this cutesy museum pays homage to Beatrix Potter and her magical Tailor of Gloucester storybook. Potter found inspiration while visiting a nearby cousin in 1894, and her tale of waistcoat-sewing mice unfolded in this very house, then home to a real-life tailor. The tiny upstairs room is cluttered with displays, plush bunnies, ducks and mice, and masses of memorabilia, while downstairs is largely given over to a shop selling Potter-related paraphernalia.
