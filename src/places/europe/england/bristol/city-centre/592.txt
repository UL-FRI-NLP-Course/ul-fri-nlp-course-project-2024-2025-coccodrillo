Georgian House | Bristol, England |  Once the home of the wealthy slave plantation owner and sugar merchant John Pinney, this 18th-century house provides an insight into aristocratic life in Bristol during the Georgian era. It's decorated in period style, with a huge kitchen (complete with cast-iron roasting spit), book-lined library, grand drawing room, and cold-water plunge-pool in the basement.
There's also a small display on Pinney's involvement in the sugar trade and the life of his enslaved valet, Pedro Jones.
