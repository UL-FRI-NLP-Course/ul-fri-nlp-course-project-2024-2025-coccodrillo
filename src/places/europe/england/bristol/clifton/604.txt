The Downs | Bristol, England |  The grassy parks of Clifton Down and Durdham Down (often referred to as just the Downs) fan out from the Clifton Suspension Bridge and make a fine spot for a picnic. Nearby, the Clifton Observatory houses a camera obscura and a tunnel leading down to the Giant's Cave, a natural cavern that emerges halfway down the cliff with dizzying views across the Avon Gorge.
