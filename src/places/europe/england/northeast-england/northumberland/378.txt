Farne Islands | Northumberland Coast, England |  During breeding season (roughly May to July), you can see feeding chicks of 20 seabird species (including puffin, kittiwake, Arctic tern, eider duck, cormorant and gull), and some 6000 grey seals, on this rocky archipelago 3 miles offshore from the fishing village of Seahouses. Boat operators, contactable through Seahouses' tourist office, depart from Seahouses' dock, including Billy Shiel.Crossings can be rough (impossible in bad weather); wear warm, waterproof clothing and an old hat to guard against the birds!
