RNLI Grace Darling Museum | Northumberland Coast, England |  Born in Bamburgh, Grace Darling was the lighthouse keeper's daughter on Outer Farne who rowed out to the grounded, flailing SS Forfarshire in 1838 and saved its crew in the middle of a dreadful storm. This refurbished museum even has her actual coble (row boat) as well as a film on the events of that stormy night. Grace was born just three houses down from the museum and is buried in the churchyard opposite.
Her ornate wrought-iron and sandstone tomb was built tall so as to be visible to passing ships.
