Leeds Art Gallery | Leeds, England |  This major gallery is packed with 19th- and 20th-century British heavyweights – Turner, Constable, Stanley Spencer, Wyndham Lewis et al – along with contemporary pieces by more recent arrivals such as Antony Gormley, sculptor of the Angel of the North. It reopened in October 2017 after a major restoration program that uncovered a lost Victorian barrel-vaulted glass ceiling in one of its rooms.
