Helmsley Walled Garden | North York Moors National Park, England |  Helmsley Walled Garden would be just another plant-and-produce centre were it not for its dramatic setting next to Helmsley Castle and its fabulous selection of flowers, fruits and vegetables (some of them rare), not to mention the herbs, which include 40 varieties of mint. If you're into horticulture with a historical twist, this is Eden. It's a short, signposted walk from Helmsley's long-stay car park.
