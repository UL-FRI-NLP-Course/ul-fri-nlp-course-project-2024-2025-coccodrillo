Ryedale Folk Museum | North York Moors National Park, England |  The largely open-air Ryedale Folk Museum is a constantly expanding collection of North York Moors buildings from different eras, including a medieval manor house, Iron Age roundhouse, a blacksmith's forge and a row of 1930s village shops. Demonstrations and displays give a fascinating insight into local life as it was in the past. There's also a small wetland area with local birdlife.
