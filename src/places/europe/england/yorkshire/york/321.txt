Church of the Holy Trinity | York, England |  Tucked away behind an inconspicuous gate and seemingly cut off from the rest of the town, the Church of the Holy Trinity is a fantastically atmospheric old building, having survived almost unchanged for the past 200 years (it has no electricity or running water). Inside are rare 17th- to 18th-century box pews, 14th- and 15th-century stained glass, and walls that seem to have been built without plumb line or spirit level.
