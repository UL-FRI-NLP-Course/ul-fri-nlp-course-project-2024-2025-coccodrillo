St Mary's Church | Whitby, England |  The 199 steps of Church Stairs lead steeply up from the end of Church St, passing the spooky graveyard of St Mary's Church, a favourite haunt of Goth courting couples. The atmospheric interior of the church is full of skewed and tilting galleries and box pews; the oldest parts date to the 12th century.
So many Dracula fans come here looking for the vampire's grave that the church has had to put a sign on the door informing the public that, alas, it's not thereâ€¦because he's not real.
