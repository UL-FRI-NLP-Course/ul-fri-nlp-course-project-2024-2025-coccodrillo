Haddon Hall | Peak District, England |  With stone turrets, time-worn timbers and walled gardens, Haddon Hall, 2 miles south of Bakewell on the A6, looks exactly like a medieval manor house should. Founded in the 12th century, it was expanded and remodelled throughout medieval times but lay dormant from 1700 until its restoration in the 1920s. Take the High Peak bus from Bakewell (Â£2.50, 10 minutes, hourly) or walk along the footpath through the fields, mostly on the east side of the river.
Spared from the more florid excesses of the Victorian period, Haddon Hall has been used as the location for numerous period blockbusters (such as 2005's Pride and Prejudice and 1998's Elizabeth).
