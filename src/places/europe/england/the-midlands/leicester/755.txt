New Walk Museum & Art Gallery | The Midlands & the Marches, England |  Highlights of this grand Victorian museum include the dinosaur galleries, the painting collection (with works by Turner and Degas), ceramics by Picasso, and the Egyptian gallery, where real mummies rub shoulders with displays about Boris Karloff's 1932 film The Mummy.
Littlies under five years can let loose in the interactive Den; older kids can follow a children's trail.
