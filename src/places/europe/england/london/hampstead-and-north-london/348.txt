Camley Street Natural Park | North London, London |  A tiny nature reserve sounds like an unlikely find in such an urban part of London, and yet Camley Street truly is wild, cramming three different habitats (woodland, grassland and wetland) for birds, butterflies, amphibians and plant life into its tiny space. There is an informative visitor centre and well-maintained paths to explore.
