Wimbledon Common | Richmond, Kew & Hampton Court, London |  Surging on into Putney Heath, Wimbledon Common blankets a staggering 460 hectares of southwest London. An astonishing expanse of open, wild and wooded space for walking (the best mode of exploration), nature trailing and picnicking, the common has its own windmill, dating from 1817. On the southern side of the common, the misnamed Caesar’s Camp is what’s left of a roughly circular earthen fort built in the 5th century BC. Take bus 93 from Wimbledon tube, train or tram station.
