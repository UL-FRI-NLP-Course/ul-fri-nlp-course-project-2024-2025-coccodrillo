Kew Palace | Richmond, Kew & Hampton Court, London |  The smallest of the royal palaces, red-brick Kew Palace in Kew Gardens is a former royal residence once known as Dutch House, built in 1631. It was the favourite home of George III and his family; his wife, Queen Charlotte, died here in 1818. Next to the palace, the Royal Kitchens have been reopened after lying dormant for two centuries.
