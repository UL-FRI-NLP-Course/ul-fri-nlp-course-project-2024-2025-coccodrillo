Museum of Brands | Notting Hill & West London, London |  This ambitious shrine to nostalgia is the brainchild of consumer historian and enthusiast Robert Opie, who has amassed advertising memorabilia and packaging since his teenage years. Arranged as a winding time tunnel leading from Victorian times up to the here and now, you'll pass by Monopoly sets, the first appearances of Mickey Mouse and Disney, a primitive version of Cluedo, Teazie-Weazie powder shampoo, radios and TVs, plus ephemera celebrating pop-culture sensations such as the Fab Four, Mork and Mindy, Star Wars, Star Trek, Buzz Lightyear, Pokemon, the Simpsons et al.
An annual adult ticket is Â£17. The museum also has a cafe at the rear and an excellent shop. See the website for details on exhibitions, talks and masterclasses at the museum.
