Institute of Contemporary Arts | The West End, London |  Housed in a Regency building designed by John Nash along the Mall, the untraditional ICA is where Picasso and Henry Moore had their first UK shows. Since then the ICA has been on the cutting (and controversial) edge of the British arts world, with an excellent range of experimental and progressive films, music nights, photography, art, lectures, multimedia works and book readings.
Thereâ€™s also the licensed ICA Cafe Bar and a small bookshop.
