St Nicholas Cole Abbey | London, England |  The first of Sir Christopher Wren's churches to be rebuilt after the Great Fire, St Nicolas was bombed down to its skeleton in the Blitz. The interior is relatively unadorned, with brass chandeliers, half-height wood panelling and a few stained-glass windows, but the brilliant Wren Coffee that's taken over the church floor makes it a lively spot for a midday mocha.
