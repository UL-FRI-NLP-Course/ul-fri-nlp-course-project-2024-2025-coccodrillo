City Wall | London, England |  Discovered after a WWII bomb razed a 19th-century warehouse, this crumbling collection of brickwork is the remains of a Roman city wall and bastion with medieval masonry piled on top. Access is via the Bastion Highwalk of the Barbican: follow the signs to 140 London Wall and take the stairs to its ground floor reception, where a footpath leads to the ruins.
