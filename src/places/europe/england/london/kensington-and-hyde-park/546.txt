Serpentine Gallery | Kensington & Hyde Park, London |  This gallery is one of London’s most important contemporary-art galleries. Damien Hirst, Andreas Gursky, Louise Bourgeois, Gabriel Orozco, Tomoko Takahashi and Jeff Koons have all exhibited here. A leading architect (who has never built in the UK) is annually commissioned to build a new ‘Summer Pavilion’ nearby, open from June to October. The galleries run a full program of readings, talks and workshops. Sister space the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, designed by Zaha Hadid, is a few minutes away over the bridge.
