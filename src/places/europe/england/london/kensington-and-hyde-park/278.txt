Saatchi Gallery | Kensington & Hyde Park, London |  This grandly housed gallery In the Duke of York's Headquarters hosts temporary exhibitions of experimental and thought-provoking work across a variety of media, much of it international in nature. The white and sanded bare-floorboard galleries are magnificently presented, while a cool shop chips in on the 1st floor. Check the (weirdly dated) website for details of current and forthcoming exhibitions. Exhibitions have also included non-contemporary and historic material, such as 2020's Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh.
