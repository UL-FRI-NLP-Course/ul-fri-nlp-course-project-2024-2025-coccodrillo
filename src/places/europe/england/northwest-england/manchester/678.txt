Elizabeth Gaskell's House | Manchester, England |  The author of Mary Barton and Cranford lived in this elegant Regency style villa from 1850 until her death in 1865. Now a fine museum devoted to Gaskell and her significant contribution to both 19th-century English literature and the fight against social inequality, you can explore the study used by Elizabeth's husband William, the beautiful dining room and a parlour full of memorabilia, including her wedding dress.
