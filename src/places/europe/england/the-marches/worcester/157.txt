Worcester Cathedral | The Midlands & the Marches, England |  Rising above the River Severn, Worcester's majestic cathedral is the final resting place of Magna Carta signatory King John. The strong-legged can scale 235 steps to the top of the tower (confirm times ahead), from where Charles II surveyed his troops during the disastrous Battle of Worcester. Hour-long tours run from the gift shop. Several works by local composer Edward Elgar had their first public outings here â€“ to appreciate the acoustics, come for evensong (5.30pm Monday to Saturday, 4pm Sunday).
