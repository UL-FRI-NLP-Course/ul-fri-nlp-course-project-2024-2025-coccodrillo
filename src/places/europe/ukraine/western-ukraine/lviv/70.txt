St Nicholas Church | Lviv, Ukraine |  Darkly mysterious and wonderfully aromatic, this is possibly Lviv's finest church away from the tourist action. It dates back to at least 1292 and is now a Ukrainian Orthodox place of worship. Under a high dome you'll find some precious icon art, lots of embroidered towels and every wall adorned in some way.
