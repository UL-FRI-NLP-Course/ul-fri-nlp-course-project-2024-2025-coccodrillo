Museum of Ethnography, Arts & Crafts | Lviv, Ukraine |  This underfunded, chaotically curated museum has a few interesting pieces of furniture, Czech glass, art nouveau posters (Mucha, Lautrec) and various 19th- and 20th-century decorative items from across Europe, the whole caboodle scattered throughout an interestingly run-down former bank. There's a large display of period clocks and the occasional well-conceived temporary exhibition.
