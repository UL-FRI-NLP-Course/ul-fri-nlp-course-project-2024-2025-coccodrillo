Transfiguration Church | Lviv, Ukraine |  The tall copper-domed church just west of the Armenian Cathedral is the late-17th-century, newly renovated Transfiguration Church, the first church in the city to revert to Greek Catholicism after Ukrainian independence in 1991. The bright, colourful interior is topped with a high dome lined with what look like Roman emperors. Particularly impressive during services.
