Assumption Church | Lviv, Ukraine |  This Ukrainian Orthodox church is easily distinguished by the 65m-high, triple-tiered Kornyakt bell tower rising beside it. The tower was named after its Greek benefactor, a merchant who was also the original owner of Kornyakt House on pl Rynok. Sadly it cannot be climbed. Itâ€™s well worth going inside the church to see the beautifully gilt interior. Normally access is through the delightful Three Saints Chapel with its three, highly ornate minicupolas.
