Church of Mykola Prytysk | Kyiv, Ukraine |  The Church of Mykola Prytysk survived the 1811 fire that destroyed much of Podil. This Ukrainian Orthodox church is the oldest structure in the district (1631) and is surrounded by several pastel-coloured brick buildings exhibiting the eclectic style in vogue in Kyiv at the end of the 19th century.
