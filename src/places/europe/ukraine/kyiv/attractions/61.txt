Mystetsky Arsenal | Kyiv, Ukraine |  Once a storage for gunpowder and harnesses, these days it is a playground for visionary curators – each exhibition becomes an event of national importance. Eclecticism rules – exhibitions feature both new and old art. Unfortunately, the place often closes for months on end in the interim periods between exhibitions. Check its website to see what's on during your visit.
