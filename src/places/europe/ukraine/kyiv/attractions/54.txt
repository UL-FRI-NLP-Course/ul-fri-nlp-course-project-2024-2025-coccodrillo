Vydubytsky Monastery | Kyiv, Ukraine |  Few churches appear more frozen in time than those of the Vydubytsky Monastery, nestled into a hill beneath the Hryshko Botanical Gardens. If you found the crowds at the Lavra a little too much to bear, you should not hesitate to come here, although noise from the adjacent highway spoils the atmosphere somewhat near the entrance and the main St Michael's Church, which dates to the 11th century.
