Fomin Botanical Gardens | Kyiv, Ukraine |  Lying behind the Universytet metro station building, the landscaped gardens are best visited in spring when just about everything there is blooming.
A short walk to the left from the entrance, you'll find a leaning apron-clad bronze figure wielding something that looks like a bow. This strange-looking monument is dedicated to the professors and students who died defending Kyiv in WWII. Students cynically call it 'monument to the deceased botanist' â€“ 'botanist' being the Russian slang word for nerd.
