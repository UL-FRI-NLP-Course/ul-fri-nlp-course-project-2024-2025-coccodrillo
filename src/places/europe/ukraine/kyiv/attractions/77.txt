Ministry of Foreign Affairs | Kyiv, Ukraine |  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was built by the Soviets on the site of the Tryokhsvyatytelska Church, one of Kyiv's holiest edifices, destroyed by Stalin in 1934. The sheer size of the building was undoubtedly meant as an additional slap in the face to the church.
