St Volodymyr's Cathedral | Kyiv, Ukraine |  Although not one of Kyiv's most important churches, St Volodymyr's Cathedral arguably has the prettiest interior. Built in the late 19th century to mark 900 years of Orthodox Christianity in the city, its yellow exterior and seven blue domes conform to standard Byzantine style. However, inside it breaks new ground with art nouveau influences.
Huge murals, flecked with golden accents, include a painting of Volodymyr the Great's baptism into Orthodox Christianity in Chersonesus (now Khersones) and of Kyiv's citizens being herded into the Dnipro River for a mass baptism soon afterwards.
