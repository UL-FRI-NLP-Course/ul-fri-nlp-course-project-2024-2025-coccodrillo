Drottningskärs kastell | Southern Sweden, Sweden |  Bristling with cannons, this fortified tower on the island of Aspö was described by Admiral Nelson of the British Royal Navy as ‘impregnable’. You can visit it on an Äspoleden, a free car ferry that runs up to twice hourly in July and August from Handelshamnen, north of the Marinmuseum.
