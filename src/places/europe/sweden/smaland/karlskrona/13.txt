Marinmuseum | Southern Sweden, Sweden |  The striking Marinmuseum is the national naval museum. Dive in for reconstructions of a battle deck in wartime, a hall full of fantastic figureheads, piles of model boats, and even some of the real thing – such as a minesweeper, the HMS Västervik and Sweden’s royal sloop. There is also a pleasant restaurant (mains from 100kr).
