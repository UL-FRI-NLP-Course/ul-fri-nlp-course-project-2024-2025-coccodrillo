Kungsholms Fort | Southern Sweden, Sweden |  Karlskrona’s star is the extraordinary offshore Kungsholms Fort, with its curious circular harbour, established in 1680 to defend the town. The fort can only be visited on two-hour guided boat tours that must be booked through Karlskrona Turistbyrå or at the Marinmuseum. Highly recommended.
