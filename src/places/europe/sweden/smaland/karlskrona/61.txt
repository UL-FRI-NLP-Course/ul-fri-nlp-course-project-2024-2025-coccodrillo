Stortorget | Southern Sweden, Sweden |  Karlskrona’s monumental square, Stortorget, was planned to rival Europe’s best. Alas, the funds ran out, resulting in a somewhat odd mix of grand architectural gestures and humble stand-ins. Dominating the square are the courthouse, along with the baroque churches Fredrikskyrkan and Trefaldighetskyrkan, the latter inspired by Rome’s Pantheon.
