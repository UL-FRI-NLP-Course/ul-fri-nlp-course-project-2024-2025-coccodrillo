Stensele Kyrka | Lappland, Sweden |  Built in 1885, with seating for 2000 over two floors, Stensele Church is Sweden's biggest wooden church. A seat was provided for every man, woman and child in the parish. Enter this massive structure, push the right buttons, and an English explanation will boom over speakers loud enough to keep even the most sleepy sermon-listener awake. Located 5km east of Storuman.
