Öresund Bridge | Malmö, Skåne |  This bridge is the longest cable-tied road and rail bridge in Europe, measuring 7.8km from Lernacken (on the Swedish side, near Malmö) to the artificial island of Peberholm (Pepper Island), south of Saltholm (Salt Island).Local commuters pay via an electronic transmitter, while tolls for everyone else are payable by credit card, debit card or in euros, Danish or Swedish currency at the Lernacken toll booths or online. Tolls paid online (at least 30 minutes before crossing) are cheaper than paying at the toll booths; see the website for exact fares.
