Moderna Museet Malmö | Malmö, Skåne |  Architects Tham & Videgård chose to make the most of the distinct 1901 Rooseum, once a power-generating turbine hall, by adding a contemporary annexe, complete with a bright, perforated orange-red facade. Venue aside, the museum's galleries are well worth visiting, with regularly updated exhibitions that often include works from the museum's own collection, which includes works by Dalí and Picasso.
