Nordiska Akvarellmuseet | Bohuslän, Sweden |  Skärhamn is home to the superb Nordiska Akvarellmuseet, a sleek waterside building housing exhibits by the likes of Arne Isacsson, whose watercolors defined the form for a generation of artists in Bohuslän, and Lars Lerin's compelling cityscapes, seemingly illuminated from within.The museum's cafe serves a damn fine cup of coffee, and the attached restaurant is a draw in its own right.
If you're inspired to linger longer, the museum rents out five modern, cube-like guest studios that sit right above the water (artists/general public 500/1000kr).
