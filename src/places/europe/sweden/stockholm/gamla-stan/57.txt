Riksdagshuset | Gamla Stan, Stockholm |  Technically situated on Helgeandsholmen, the little island in the middle of Norrstr√∂m, rather than on Gamla Stan, the Swedish Parliament building is an unexpected pleasure to visit. The building consists of two parts: the older front section (facing downstream) dates from the early 20th century, but the other more-modern part contains the current debating chamber. Tours of the building offer a compelling glimpse into the Swedish system of consensus-building government.
