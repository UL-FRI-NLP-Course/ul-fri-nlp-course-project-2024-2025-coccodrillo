Ulriksdals Slott | Stockholm, Sweden |  The 17th-century royal pad Ulriksdals Slott was home to King Gustaf VI Adolf and his family until 1973. Several of their exquisite apartments, including the Carl Malmsten–designed drawing room from 1923, are open to the public by guided tour (in Swedish). The stables house Queen Kristina’s magnificent 17th-century coronation carriage, while the Orangery contains Swedish sculpture and Mediterranean flora.
