Kyrkstaden | Lappland, Sweden |  The main attraction of Vilhelmina is its colourful restored church town. Its 30-plus cottages were built when the church was consecrated in 1792 and parishioners from distant villages were required to attend services from afar. These days you'll find Kyrkstaden buildings being used for a Sami handicraft shop, an old-style general store, an art gallery and a hostel.
