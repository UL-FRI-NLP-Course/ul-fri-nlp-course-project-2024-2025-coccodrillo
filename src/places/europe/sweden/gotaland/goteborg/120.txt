Världskulturmuseet | Gothenburg, Sweden |  In a striking building by London-based architects Cécile Brisac and Edgar Gonzalez, the Världskulturmuseet sees ethnography, art and global politics collide in immersive multimedia exhibitions. Recent ones have included a study of significant textile patterns in various cultures, enchantingly displayed with multicolored lights; and a collection of photos from various historic expeditions.
