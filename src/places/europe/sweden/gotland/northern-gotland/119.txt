Bungenäs | Gotland, Sweden |  Formerly a military base (and part of the adjoining land still is used by the military), this bizarre and wonderful collection of unexpected buildings by the water has been turned into a cafe, event space and accommodation. Bring your swimmers if the weather is fine – there's a jetty and a nice spot to jump in for a dip.
It's about a 1.5km walk from the car park to where the action is.
