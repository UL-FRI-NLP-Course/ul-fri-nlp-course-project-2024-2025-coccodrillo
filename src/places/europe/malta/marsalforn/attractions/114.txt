Żebbuġ | Gozo, Malta |  Żebbuġ is a quiet Gozitan village in the hills west of Marsalforn. It is mainly residential as accommodation and services for travellers are largely gathered around Marsalforn Bay. Żebbuġ is renowned for excellent lace-making, however, and onyx found locally has been used to decorate the village's Parish Church.
