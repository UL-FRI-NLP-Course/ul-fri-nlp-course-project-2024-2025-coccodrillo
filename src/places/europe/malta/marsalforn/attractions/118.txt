Xwieni Bay | Gozo, Malta |  Around 1.5km from Marsalforn, Xwieni Bay is separated from neighbouring Qbajjar Bay by a headland with a small fort. Xwieni combines a sandy beach for good swimming with a few simple food and drink kiosks. Slightly further west, Gozo's fascinating coastal strip of salt pans begins.
