Salt Pans | Gozo, Malta |  Walk or drive west along the promenade, past the tiny sand beaches at Qbajjar Bay and the more scenic Xwieni Bay, until you reach a rocky shore. This wild and extraordinary landscape has been carved into a patchwork of salt pans. There's usually a small stall selling salt from the pans, which are owned by three families and still worked in summer.
