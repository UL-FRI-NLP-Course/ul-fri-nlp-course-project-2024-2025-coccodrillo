Ta'Kola Windmill | Gozo, Malta |  Built in 1725 at the instigation of the Knights, who built many such windmills to encourage the production of flour (this is one of the few left standing), Ta'Kola now houses a cute museum of country life, with displays of tools and living quarters. Best, though, is the climb up the narrow stairs to see the original milling gear, complete with huge millstones.
