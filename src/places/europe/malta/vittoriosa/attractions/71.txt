Maritime Museum | Vittoriosa, Malta |  The old naval bakery, built in the 1840s and operating until the 1950s, now houses a wealth of material on Maltaâ€™s maritime past. The collection includes huge Roman anchors, traditional Maltese fishing boats and models of the Knights' galleys. The small details of naval life are among the most fascinating: bone-dye and hashish pipes used for whiling away hours at sea, plus local prostitutes' licences indicating the lifestyle back on land.
