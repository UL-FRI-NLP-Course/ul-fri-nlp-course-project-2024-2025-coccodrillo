Vedette (Watchtower) | Malta, Europe |  The vedette is decorated with carvings of eyes and ears, symbolising watchfulness, and commands a view to the west over the length of the Grand Harbour and southern flanks of Valletta. At noon and 4pm, the surrounding Gardjola Gardens are a wonderful location to watch the cannon firing at the Saluting Battery across the harbour.
