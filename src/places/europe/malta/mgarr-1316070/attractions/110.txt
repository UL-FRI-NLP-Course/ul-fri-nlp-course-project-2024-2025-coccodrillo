Mġarr Shelter | Northern Malta, Malta |  The Mġarr Shelter was used by locals during the WWII bombings of Malta (enter through Il-Barri restaurant). You can only imagine the long uncomfortable hours spent down here in the humidity, 12m underground, but to show that life went on under such tough conditions there are rooms on display that served as classrooms and hospitals.
