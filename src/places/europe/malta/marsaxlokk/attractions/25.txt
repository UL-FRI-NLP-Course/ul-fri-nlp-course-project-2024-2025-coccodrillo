Sunday Fish Market | Southern Malta, Malta |  At Marsaxlokk's colourful, packed-to-the-gills Sunday Fish Market, you can admire the riches of the Med before they're whisked off to Malta's top hotels and restaurants. The market starts early in the morning and the best stuff is long gone by afternoon. Note that parking is at an absolute premium, so consider catching the bus. Expect it also to be very full.
