MUŻA | Valletta, Malta |  MUŻA is a 2018 incarnation of Malta's Museum of Fine Arts, which closed in a previous location in 2016. Sited in the Auberge d'Italie, a 16th-century building once housing Italian members of the Knights of St John, MUŻA combines highlights from the former museum, including historic maps and paintings, with an interactive 21st-century approach to community art and storytelling.
