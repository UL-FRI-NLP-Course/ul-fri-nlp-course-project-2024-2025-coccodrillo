Upper Barrakka Gardens | Valletta, Malta |  These colonnaded gardens perched high above Grand Harbour were created in the late 16th century as a relaxing haven for the Knights from the nearby Auberge d'Italie. They provide a shady retreat from the bustle of the city, and the balcony has one of the best views in Malta.The terrace below is occupied by the Saluting Battery, where a cannon once fired salutes to visiting naval vessels.
