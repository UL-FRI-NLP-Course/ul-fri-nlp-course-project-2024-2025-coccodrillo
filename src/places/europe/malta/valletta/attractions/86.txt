Valletta Contemporary | Valletta, Malta |  Emblematic of Valletta's cultural development during the city's 2018 stint as a European Capital of Culture is this modern gallery with an ever-changing roster of exhibitions and installations from local and international artists. As the first opening on largely abandoned Triq il-Levant ('East St'), it promises to be a catalyst for the area's regeneration. Check the website for opening hours.
