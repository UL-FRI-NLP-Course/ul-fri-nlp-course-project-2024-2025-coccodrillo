Palazzo Castellania | Valletta, Malta |  Restored for Valletta's stint as the European Capital of Culture in 2018, Palazzo Castellania originally housed Valletta's law courts and prison. The figures above the 1st-floor balcony represent Justice and Truth, and the building was constructed in the baroque style by the Order of St John from 1757 to 1760. The building's contemporary tenant is Malta's Ministry of Health.
