GÄ§arb Folklore Museum | Gozo, Malta |  This 18th-century house, once the home of Frenc Mercieca, a local wise man who apparently was able to cure ailments, has 28 rooms crammed with a fascinating, lovely jumble of folk artefacts. The exhibits, assembled by the owner over the past 25 years, include a child's hearse, farming implements, fishing gear and jam-making equipment. Opening hours can be haphazard, so phone ahead.
