Wignacourt Tower | Northern Malta, Malta |  Built in 1609, the Wignacourt Tower was the first of the towers built by Grand Master Wignacourt. It guards the point to the west of the church, and houses a tiny museum with exhibits on local fortress history, including a small selection of guns and armour. There are stupendous views from here. It's volunteer-run, so opening hours can be flexible.
