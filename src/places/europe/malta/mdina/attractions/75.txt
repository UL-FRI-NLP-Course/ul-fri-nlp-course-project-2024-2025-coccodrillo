Cathedral Museum | Mdina, Malta |  The Cathedral Museum's outstanding highlight is a series of woodcut and copperplate prints and lithographs by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht DÃ¼rer. However, there are other items of interest, including Egyptian amulets dating from the 5th-century BC and a remarkable coin collection, which includes Carthaginian and Romana-Maltese examples. The museum is housed in a baroque 18th-century palace originally used as a seminary.
