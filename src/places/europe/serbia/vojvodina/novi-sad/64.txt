Synagogue | Novi Sad, Serbia |  The 1909 Synagogue of Novi Sad, designed by Hungarian architect Lipót Baumhorn, was built as the fifth one on the same location to serve the city’s once large Jewish community, and is nowadays used as a concert hall due to its fine acoustics. Its art nouveau facade, yellowed bricks, stained-glass windows and sheer size make it a desirable photo and film location.
