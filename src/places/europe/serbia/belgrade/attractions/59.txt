Museum of Science and Technology | Belgrade, Serbia |  The name may sound dry, but this is a marvellous place for visitors – especially families – to spend a couple of hours. This wonderful museum showcases Serbia's contributions to science, medicine and technology, with excellent displays and interactive exhibits (all in English) suitable for both adults and kids; the latter will particularly enjoy the mesmerising collection of old-school toys.
