Museum of the Yugoslav Film Archive | Belgrade, Serbia |  This small but fascinating museum houses almost 80,000 films from the former Yugoslavia, as well as important works from across the world and tons of cinematic paraphernalia, including the first Serbian film (dating from 1904) and Charlie Chaplin's stick. It has regular screenings of important, obscure (and everything in between) movies; check the website for dates, times and prices.
