Tverskaya Ploshchad | Moscow, Russia |  A statue of the founder of Moscow, Yury Dolgoruky, presides over this prominent square near the bottom of Tverskaya ul. So does Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, as the buffed-up five-storey building opposite is the Moscow mayorâ€™s office.
Many ancient churches are hidden in the surrounding backstreets, including the 17th-century Church of Sts Kosma and Damian.
