Moscow Cathedral Mosque | Moscow, Russia |  The original building of Moscowâ€™s main mosque dates back to 1904, but it was demolished in 2011 and rebuilt from scratch. Unlike many religious institutions, the Cathedral Mosque never closed during Soviet times, and for years it was the only active mosque in the city. The six-storey Byzantine-style building has a lavish gold-leaf-covered dome, while the interior walls are adorned with calligraphic verses from the Quran.
