Moscow Design Museum | Moscow, Russia |  Insightful exhibits examine the history, present and future of design, eg Soviet Design 1950–1980 and New Olds: Classics & Innovation in Design. Exhibits are held at museums and venues around town and around the world. And sometimes they are held in the 'mobile exhibit hall' – a big, boldly decorated bus that brings design to the people wherever they are.
