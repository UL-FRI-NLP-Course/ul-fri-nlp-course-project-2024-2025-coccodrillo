Museum of Wooden Architecture | Moscow, Russia |  Just outside the New Jerusalem Monastery’s west wall, the Moscow region’s outdoor architectural museum is a collection of picturesque peasant cottages and windmills set along the river. The museum keeps sporadic hours but the views of the river and meadows are lovely.
