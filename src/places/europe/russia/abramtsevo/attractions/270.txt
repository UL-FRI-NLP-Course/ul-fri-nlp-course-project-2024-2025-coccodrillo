Bathhouse | Moscow, Russia |  Completed in 1878, this is a good example of old Russian architecture, with a wood-carved exterior and chequer-painted roof. When the Mamontovs lived on the estate, the building was used primarily as a guesthouse, and now houses an exhibit of carpentry and woodwork, including work by Yelena Polenova, who organised a wood-carving studio here back in the day.
