State Russian Museum and Exhibition Centre ROSPHOTO | St Petersburg, Russia |  This gallery showcases rotating exhibitions of photography, videography and other mixed media drawn from across Russia and around the world. Itâ€™s definitely one of the best spaces for seeing contemporary photographic work in St Petersburg. Note the beautiful stained-glass windows on the stairwell of the handsome building the gallery is located in, which housed an insurance company before the revolution.
The gallery's well-stocked art bookshop and pleasant cafe are also worth a look.
