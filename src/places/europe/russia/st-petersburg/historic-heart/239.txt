Brodsky House-Museum | St Petersburg, Russia |  This is the former home of Isaak Brodsky, Repinâ€™s favourite student and one of the favoured artists of the revolution (not to be confused with Joseph Brodsky, one of the least-favourite poets of the same regime). Besides being a painter himself, Brodsky was also an avid collector, and his house-museum contains his collection of thousands of works, including lesser-known paintings by top 19th-century artists such as Repin, Levitan and Kramskoy.
