Park Pobedy | St Petersburg, Russia |  This large green space gathers a cross-section of Petersburgers, including young families, teens and canoodling couples who stroll the leafy paths and enjoy the views over the ponds and flower gardens. Built to celebrate Russiaâ€™s victory in WWII, the park is full of statues of Soviet war heroes and has a beneficent depiction of Lenin interacting with small children. To get to the Park, walk 1.7km north up Moskovsky pr, or hop on a bus or tram heading north.
