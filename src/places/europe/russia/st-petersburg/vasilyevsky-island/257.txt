Mendeleev Museum | St Petersburg, Russia |  Call ahead to arrange a tour of this small but interesting museum inside St Petersburg University and dedicated to Dmitry Mendeleev, creator of the periodic table of elements in 1869. His study has been lovingly preserved and you can see his desk (where he always stood rather than sat) and early drafts of the periodic table.
Entry is via the main gate on Mendeleevskaya liniya.
