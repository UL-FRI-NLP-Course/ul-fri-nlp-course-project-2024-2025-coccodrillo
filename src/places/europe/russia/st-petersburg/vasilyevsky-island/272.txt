Novy Museum | St Petersburg, Russia |  This compact contemporary art museum, with galleries on the 3rd and 4th floors, is worth visiting to see all kinds of visual art forms created by a group of 'non-conformist' artists working in the Soviet Union in the latter part of the 20th century. The private collection of over 500 pieces is displayed in exhibitions that change every three months or so.
