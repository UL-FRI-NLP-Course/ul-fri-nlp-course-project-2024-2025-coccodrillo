SS Peter & Paul Cathedral | St Petersburg, Russia |  All of Russia's prerevolutionary rulers from Peter the Great onwards (except Peter II and Ivan VI) are buried inside this cathedral. The magnificent baroque interior is quite different from other Orthodox churches, and from May to October you can climb the landmark needle-thin spire of the bell tower (adult/child R250/150).
