Peter & Paul Fortress | St Petersburg, Russia |  Housing a cathedral where the Romanovs are buried, a former prison and various exhibitions, this large defensive fortress on Zayachy Island is the kernel from which St Petersburg grew into the city it is today. History buffs will love it and everyone will swoon at the panoramic views from atop the fortress walls, at the foot of which lies a sandy riverside beach, a prime spot for sunbathing.
Individual tickets are needed for each of the fortress’s attractions – though a combined entrance ticket gives access to Peter & Paul Cathedral, the Trubetskoy Bastion and three other sites. The main entrance is across the Ioannovsky Bridge at the island's northeast end; there's also access via the Kronwerk Bridge, which is within walking distance of Sportivnaya metro station.
