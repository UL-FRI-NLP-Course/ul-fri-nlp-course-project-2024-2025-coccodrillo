Sigmund Freud Museum of Dreams | St Petersburg, Russia |  This odd conceptual exhibition, based on abstractions and ideas, not artefacts, is an outgrowth of the Psychoanalytic Institute that houses it. The two-room exhibition aims to stimulate your subconscious as you struggle to read the display symbolising what Freud himself would have dreamt. Illustrations of Freud’s patients’ dreams and quotations line the dimly lit, incense-scented hall. English is spoken.
