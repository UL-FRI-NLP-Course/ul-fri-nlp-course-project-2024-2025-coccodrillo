Peter's Tree | St Petersburg, Russia |  According to legend Kamenny Island was the site where Peter the Great planted an oak tree, which stood proudly over many years. The old oak, however, died and has since been replaced with a young, healthy tree; nevertheless, it is still known as Peterâ€™s Tree.
