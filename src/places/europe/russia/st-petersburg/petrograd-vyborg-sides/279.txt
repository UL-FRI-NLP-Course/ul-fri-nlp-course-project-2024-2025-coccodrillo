Chaliapin House Museum | St Petersburg, Russia |  Opera buffs will want to visit this house–museum where the great singer Fyodor Chaliapin (1873–1938) lived before fleeing the Soviet Union in 1922. The kindly babushkas (clearly music lovers) will happily play some of the singer’s recordings for you as you peruse his personal effects. Check online for details of concerts held here.
