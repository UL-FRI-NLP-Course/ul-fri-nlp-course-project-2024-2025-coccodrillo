Fine Arts Museum | Western Siberia, Russia |  The Fine Arts Museum has several rotating and permanent exhibits ranging from ornate window frames saved from the cityâ€™s old wooden houses to tiny, intricately carved bone figures produced by Siberian artists. While it's certainly one of the better galleries in Siberia, it gets expensive if you want to see all of the exhibits.
