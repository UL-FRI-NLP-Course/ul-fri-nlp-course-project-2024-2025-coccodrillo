Minsalim Folk Art | Western Siberia, Russia |  Minsalim is a master bone-carver who turns mammoth tusks and antler fragments into detailed figurines related to myths and legends of the local brand of shamanism. With a long mustache and flowing mane, eccentric Minsalim is something of a shaman himself and will gladly lead you on a tour of his workshop behind the gallery (phone in advance). His son and some members of staff speak English.
