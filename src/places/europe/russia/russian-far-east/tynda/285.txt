BAM Builders Monument | Russian Far East, Russia |  This iconic and rather aggressive looking statue is Tynda's most obvious sight. It's dedicated to the massive human effort (both voluntary and not) needed to build the extraordinary Baikal-Amur Magistral (BAM) railway line. Locals know the statue colloquially as muzhchina s molotkom â€“ the guy with the hammer.
