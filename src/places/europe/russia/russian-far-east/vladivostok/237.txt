Funicular | Vladivostok, Russia |  Vladivostok’s well-oiled funicular railway makes a fun 60-second ride up a 100m hill every few minutes (unless the old girl is experiencing one of her frequent 'technical breaks'). At the top, cross ul Sukhanova via the underpass to a great lookout over the bay. It’s next to a statue of Sts Cyril and Methodius (inventors of the Cyrillic alphabet) on the campus of DVGTU.
The base of the funicular is about a 15-minute walk from the centre.
