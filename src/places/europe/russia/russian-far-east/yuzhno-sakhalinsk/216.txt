Museum of Sakhalin Island: A Book by AP Chekhov | Sakhalin Island, Russia |  Based on Chekhovâ€™s seminal account of his few months working as a doctor on Sakhalin in the 1890s, this museum provides insight not only into life on Sakhalin in tsarist Russia but also into the life of the great playwright. More interesting than the untranslated Chekhov works are multimedia exhibits and lifesize models that give an idea of life on the island; there's even a recreated sleeping quarters for convicts (though you'll have to imagine the roaches and bedbugs).
A small gallery of temporary artwork is upstairs. The surrounding park has a few sculptures of Chekhov personages.
