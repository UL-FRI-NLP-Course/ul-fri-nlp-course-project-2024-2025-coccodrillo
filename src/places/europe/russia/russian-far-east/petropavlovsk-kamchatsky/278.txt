Vulkanarium | Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia |  This new museum was just about to open during our last visit to Kamchatka, and a quick peek inside as they were putting up the display revealed an impressive series of rooms with panels in English about the local volcanic clusters and their extraordinary, awesome powers. Definitely a good place to go before climbing one of the nearby giants.
