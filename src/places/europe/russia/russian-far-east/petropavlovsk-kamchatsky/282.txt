Trinity Cathedral | Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia |  Petropavlovsk's largest and most impressive church is this golden-domed stunner, which sits on an outcrop from where it is visible from all over the city. Despite looking ancient, the church was built in the early 21st century, and still isn't complete as funds have dwindled. Still, from here there are great views of the bay.
