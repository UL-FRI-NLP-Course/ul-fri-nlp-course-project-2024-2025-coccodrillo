Mammoth Museum | Yakutsk, Russia |  Despite its rather exciting-sounding name, this one-room museum is rather a let-down due to its total lack of signage in English. On the plus side, there is an almost complete mammoth skeleton on display, as a well as a model of 'Dima', the mummified mammoth calf discovered in the region.
