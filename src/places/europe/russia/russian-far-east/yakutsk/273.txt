Khomus Museum | Yakutsk, Russia |  Khomus (Jew’s harps) play a big part in Sakha culture. Concerts occur year-round, when performers imitate natural sounds such as a horse neighing. The unexpected (and unfortunately soundtrack-free) Khomus Museum has a collection showcasing international Jew’s harp heroes from present and past. Ask the welcoming staff for a demonstration.
