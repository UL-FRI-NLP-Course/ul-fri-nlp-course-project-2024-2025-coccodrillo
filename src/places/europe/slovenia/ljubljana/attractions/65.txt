Slovenian Museum of Natural History | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  This museum shares the same building as the National Museum of Slovenia, and contains reassembled mammoth and whale skeletons, stuffed birds, reptiles and mammals. The mineral collections amassed by the philanthropic Baron Žiga Zois in the early 19th century and the display on Slovenia’s unique salamander Proteus anguinus are worth the visit. Note the entrance to both museums is on the eastern side of the building, facing the park.
