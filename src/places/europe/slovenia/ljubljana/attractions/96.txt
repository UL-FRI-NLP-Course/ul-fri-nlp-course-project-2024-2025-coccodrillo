Trg Republike | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  Center’s main plaza is dominated by a pair of glowering, grey tower blocks – TR3, housing offices and embassies, and the headquarters of Nova Ljubljanska Banka – and a couple of garish revolutionary monuments. But the car park that once created such an eyesore is gone and the square has been cobbled in lovely blue Slovenian granite.
