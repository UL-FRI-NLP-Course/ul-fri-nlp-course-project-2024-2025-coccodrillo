Slovenian Ethnographic Museum | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  Housed in the 1886 Belgian Barracks on the southern edge of Metelkova, this museum has a permanent collection on the 2nd and 3rd floors. There’s traditional Slovenian trades and handicrafts – everything from beekeeping and blacksmithing to glass-painting and pottery making – and some excellent exhibits directed at children.
