Funicular Lower Station | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  The easiest (and for kids, the most fun) way to access Ljubljana Castle is to take the 70m-long funicular that leaves from the Old Town not far from Vodnikov trg. Cable cars leave at regular intervals throughout the day. Buy tickets on-site; ticket options include castle entry or funicular only.
