Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  This gallery, housed in a sleekly redesigned block building, picks up the thread from its sister institution, the Museum of Modern Art, with Eastern European (mostly ex-Yugoslav) works from the 1960s till today. Plenty of obscure material here, but just as much of it is challenging and thought-provoking.
