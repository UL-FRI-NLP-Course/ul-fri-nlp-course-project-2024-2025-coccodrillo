Railway Museum | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  A trainspotter's dreamland, there's a boiler room here with 10 locomotives (one going back to 1861 and one you can climb all over) and carriages. In the old ticket office opposite you'll find maps, uniforms, lanterns and signalling equipment. It's just north of Center.
