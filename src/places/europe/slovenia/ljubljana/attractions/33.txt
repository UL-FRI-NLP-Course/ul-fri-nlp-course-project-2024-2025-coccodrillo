Museum of Contemporary History of Slovenia | Ljubljana, Slovenia |  This museum, housed in the 18th-century Cekin Mansion (Grad Cekinov), traces the history of Slovenia in the 20th century through multimedia and artefacts. Note the contrast between the sober earnestness of the communist-era rooms and the exuberant, logo-mad commercialism of the industrial exhibits. The sections focusing on Ljubljana under occupation during WWII are very effective. The gloriously baroque Ceremonial Hall (Vite≈°ka Dvorana) on the 1st floor is how the whole mansion once looked. Cutting-edge special exhibits too.
