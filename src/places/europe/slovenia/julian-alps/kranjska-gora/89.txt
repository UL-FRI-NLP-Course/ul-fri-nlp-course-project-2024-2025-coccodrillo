Slovenian Alpine Museum | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  This modern, interactive museum dedicated to mountain exploration is a great rainy-day activity, especially for kids. There are movies showing off the beauty of the peaks, lots of climbing gear and even an escape room. The museum is located in Mojstrana, about 15km south of Kranjska Gora. It's the traditional starting point for the northern approaches to Mt Triglav.
