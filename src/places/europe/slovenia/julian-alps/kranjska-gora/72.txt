Jasna Lake | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  Jasna Lake lies just south of Kranjska Gora, and if you're heading over the Vršič Pass it's the first spot of interest. It's a small, blue glacial lake with white sand around its rim and the little Pišnica River flowing alongside. Standing guard is a bronze statue of Zlatorog. The lake is a popular recreation area; there's a pocket of accommodation on the hill above.
