Church of the Assumption of Virgin Mary | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  Kranjska Gora's late-Gothic church, at the centre of town, lends a dignified element to what is, in effect, a ski resort. The church's design dates from 1510 and the Gothic influence can be seen clearly in the ribbed vaulting. The doors are normally open daily from 9am to 6pm, though you can only enter the interior during Mass (times posted by the door).
