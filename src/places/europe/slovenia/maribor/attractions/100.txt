Synagogue | Maribor, Slovenia |  Just north of the pentagonal 16th-century Water Tower on the waterfront, a set of steps leads up to Å½idovska ulica (Jewish St), the centre of the Jewish district in the Middle Ages, and home to this 15th-century synagogue. It contains Gothic key stones and tomb fragments; the special exhibitions and 15-minute video are enlightening.
