Prešeren Memorial Museum | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  The restored Prešeren House now contains the Prešeren Memorial Museum in five rooms, two of them with original furnishings. Unfortunately, most of the explanatory notes next to the poet's letters, diaries and manuscripts are in Slovene only. Prešeren is buried in the parish cemetery, now called Prešeren Grove (Prešernov Gaj), about 500m to the north.
