Linhartov Trg | The Julian Alps, Slovenia |  Radovljica's colourful main square is the town’s leading attraction, lined with houses from the 16th and 17th centuries. Look especially for Thurn Manor, a baroque palace that is home to museums and a school of music, and Koman House, identified by a baroque painting of St Florian on its facade. Mali House has a barely visible picture of St George slaying the dragon. Vidič House has a corner projection and is painted in red, yellow, green and blue.
At the southern end of the square, take the small street beside house number 28 to find a lovely viewpoint over the Lipnica Valley, with information boards detailing walking tracks in the area.
