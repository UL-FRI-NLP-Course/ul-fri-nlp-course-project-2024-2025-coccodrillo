Church of St Clement | Piran, Slovenia |  Just behind Punta lighthouse, the round, serrated tower of the Church of St Clement (originally built in the 13th century but altered 500 years later) evokes the ancient beacon from which Piran got its name. The door is usually left open and you can see inside through a grille.
