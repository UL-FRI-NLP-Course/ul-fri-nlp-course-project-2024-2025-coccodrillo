Fredenskirche | Greenland, Europe |  Fredenskirche, Paamiut's colourful 1909 church, has a Norwegian-style Hansel-and-Gretel fa√ßade. Incredibly the church was 'stretched' by 6m in the 1980s: try to spot the added two-window section. To visit the interior, enquire at the priest's office, which is a relatively grand red mansion across the footbridge.
