Lund Cottage | Greenland, Europe |  Henrik Lund (1875-1948) was a priest, painter and poet whose song 'Nunarput' has since become Greenland's national anthem. Outside the red-and-green Lund Cottage, amid wildflowers, his bust sports a Lutheran priest's ruff, and his bronze lips have turned blue - from graffiti, not Arctic cold.
