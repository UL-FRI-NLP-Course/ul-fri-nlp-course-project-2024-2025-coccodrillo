Omerbašića Mosque | Adriatic Coast, Montenegro |   Just outside Stari Bar's main gate, this simple construction (dating from 1662) has a square stone base and an elegant minaret enclosed by a stone wall. The domed structure near the entrance is the tomb of Dervish Hasan. Many of the Roma people who make a significant proportion of Stari Bar’s remaining population practise Islam.
