Beach | Podgorica, Montenegro |  The rocky Morača riverbank off Stara Varoš serves as Podgorica's main beach, complete with a summertime bar, deckchairs and sun umbrellas. It's a far cry from the sea beaches Montenegro is famous for – and litter can be a problem – but in the middle of a Podgorica heatwave, it's heavenly.
