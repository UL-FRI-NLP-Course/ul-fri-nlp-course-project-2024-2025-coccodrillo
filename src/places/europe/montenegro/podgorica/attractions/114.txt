Ribnica Fortress | Podgorica, Montenegro |  The ruin of this 15th-century Ottoman-built fortress guards the confluence of Podgorica's two rivers. Its best-preserved element is a little arched bridge crossing the Ribnica. It's not very well taken care of (there's often rubbish strewn about), but it's still worth a stroll.
