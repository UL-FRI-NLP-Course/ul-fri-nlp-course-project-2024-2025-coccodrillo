Presjek | Adriatic Coast, Montenegro |  This quiet, boulder-strewn beach is great for snorkelling (bring your own gear) or simply slipping off and finding your own secluded swimming spot. Get here by following the footpath that starts at the car park below the village church and onwards through the woods.
