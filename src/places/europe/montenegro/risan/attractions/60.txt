Mosaics | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |  In 1930, the foundations of a grand villa were discovered in Risan, complete with wonderfully preserved Roman mosaics from the 2nd century AD. The building’s not much to look at from the outside, but within, you’ll find a dining-room floor decorated with flowers, herbs, grapevines and squid, while other rooms have intricate geometric patterns. Best of all is the bedroom, with its glorious depiction of Hypnos, the Greek god of sleep, reclining on a pillow.
English-speaking staff are at hand to explain the building’s layout.
