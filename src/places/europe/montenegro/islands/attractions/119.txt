Grmožur | Lake Skadar National Park, Montenegro |  Grmožur, the closest island to Virpazar, is topped by a Turkish-built fortress (1843). It served as a prison until the early 20th century; apparently, only one person ever escaped from the island, earning it the nickname ‘the Montenegrin Alcatraz’.
