St Mary's Collegiate Church | Kotor, Montenegro |  Built in 1221 on the site of a 6th-century basilica, this Catholic church is distinguished by impressive 20th-century bronze doors covered in bas-reliefs, the remains of frescoes, a particularly gruesome larger-than-life crucifix, and a glass coffin containing the body of Blessed Osanna of Cattaro (1493â€“1565). She was what is known as an anchoress, choosing to be walled into a small cell attached to a church so as to devote her life to prayer.
