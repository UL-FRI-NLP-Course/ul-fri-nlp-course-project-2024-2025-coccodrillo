Church of the Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |  Even the name of this whopping church is outsized. It’s said to be the biggest religious building on the Adriatic coast and it certainly dominates this little town in a God-is-watching-you kind of way. It was begun in 1789 but not completed until 1908, when Catholics were in the majority in Prčanj.
A grand stairway leads up to a terrace offering commanding views of the bay, enjoyed by the slightly bug-eyed statues of St Peter and St Paul on the church’s baroque facade. Inside is an interesting array of sculpture and a skeleton displayed in a glass coffin.
