Mirišta | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |  This beach may be smaller than neighbouring Žanjic, but it's every bit as popular. The Austro-Hungarian Arza fortress lies abandoned (for how long remains to be seen along this development-crazed coastline) at the tip of Mirišta; it's not in the best condition and safety isn't guaranteed, but if you simply can't help yourself, it's there for the exploring.
