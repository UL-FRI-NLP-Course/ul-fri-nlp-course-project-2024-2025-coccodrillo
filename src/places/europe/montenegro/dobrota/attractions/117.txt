St Eustace's Church | Bay of Kotor, Montenegro |  Cavernous St Eustaceâ€™s dates from 1773 but has a 19th-century steeple and a little walled graveyard. It houses a valuable collection of paintings, including by Bellini and baroque master Carlo Dolci. Opening hours are iffy: you may be able to get in on Sundays.
