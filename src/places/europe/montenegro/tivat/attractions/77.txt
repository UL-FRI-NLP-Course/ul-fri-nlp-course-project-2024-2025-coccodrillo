Maritime Heritage Collection | Tivat, Montenegro |  Porto Montenegro doffs its hat to its past with this well-curated display (in Montenegrin and English) devoted to the history of the Arsenal shipyard and naval base, housed in one of the site's beautiful old boat sheds. The star exhibits are too big for the museum: the two Yugoslav navy submarines are dry docked outside.
Parents can let the kids off the leash at an aptly nautical-themed playground right next to the museum.
