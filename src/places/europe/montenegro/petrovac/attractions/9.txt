Kastio | Petrovac, Montenegro |  Clamber up the steps of this small Venetian fortress for photogenic views of the beach and the dramatic diagonal stratification of the limestone cliffs melting into the turquoise water below. An interesting socialist-realist bas-relief remembering the ‘socialist revolution’ is partly obscured in the foliage. The entrance is by the small Petrovac harbour.
