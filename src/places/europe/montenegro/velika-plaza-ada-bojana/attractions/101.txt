Milena Canal | Adriatic Coast, Montenegro |  On the drive out to Velika Plaža, keep your eyes out for the murky Milena canal, where local fishermen use nets suspended from long willow rods attached to wooden stilt houses. The effect is remarkably redolent of Southeast Asia. There are more of these contraptions on the banks of the Bojana River at the other end of Velika Plaža.
