Käsmu Sea Museum | Lahemaa National Park, Estonia |  The former Soviet border-guard barracks at Käsmu now shelters this eclectic museum, displaying artefacts relating to sailing, fishing, smuggling and other marine activities. On the grounds you'll find one of only two wooden lighthouses in the country and a 15m observation tower, manned throughout the Soviet era to prevent defectors from Estonia. The owners of this private museum live on-site, so there are no formal opening hours.
