Market Square | Estonia, Europe |  For a Soviet-era plaza, Tartu's expansive main square is actually pretty cool. Big yellow steel lamps arch over pebble circles and fountains, and there's a whimsical statue of composer Arvo PÃ¤rt pictured as a young boy holding his bicycle. Around its perimeter you'll find cafes and the tourist office.
