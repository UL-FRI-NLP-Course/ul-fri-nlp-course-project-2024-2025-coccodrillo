Livonian People's House | Latvia, Europe |  Opened with great pride in 1939, this art deco-ish cultural centre hosts gatherings of Liv descendants (the Liv Festival on the first Saturday in August draws crowds from the Livonian diaspora worldwide) and has exhibitions on their culture. In summer there's usually a small cafe.
