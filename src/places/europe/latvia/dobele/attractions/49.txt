Castle Ruins | Southern Latvia, Latvia |  These impressive Livonian Order castle ruins, which date back to the 1300s, are well worth a stop. This brick bastion was built over the original site of an earlier Semigallian stronghold. In 1289 the Semigallians incinerated their own castle and fled to Lithuania rather than surrender the structure to the invading crusaders. A monument commemorates their departure. The site today is surrounded by a nice park.
