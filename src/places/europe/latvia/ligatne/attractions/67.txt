Vienkoču Parks | Latvia, Europe |  Rihards, a local wood carver, has filled a 10-hectare park with his unique creations. Short trails snake past modern art installations, a classical garden, model houses and displays about wooden shipbuilding. Buy yourself a hand-crafted wooden bowl. The park is right off the A2, at the Līgatne turn.
