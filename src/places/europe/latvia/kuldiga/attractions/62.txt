St Katrīna’s Church | Latvia, Europe |  The most important church in town: Katrina (St Catherine) is Kuldīga’s patron saint and protector, and is featured on the town’s coat of arms. The church dates to 1252 and was rebuilt in the mid-1600s. Inside it's atmospherically musty; you can climb the tower for good views. The stroll from here to the Town Garden is a delight.
