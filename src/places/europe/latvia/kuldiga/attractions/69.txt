KuldÄ«ga Historic Museum | Latvia, Europe |  This engaging museum is housed in what a local legend 'claims' was a Russian pavilion from the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris. The 2nd floor recreates the apartment of a rich early-20th-century local family and features an international playing-cards collection in the 'master's room'.
