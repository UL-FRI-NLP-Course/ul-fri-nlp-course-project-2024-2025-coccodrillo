Zlēku Baznīca | Latvia, Europe |  On a little hill, the proud white 1645 church looks mundane outside but inside is a national treasure: the towering 17th-century altarpiece is a masterpiece of wood carving. Ornate decor throughout is befitting of what was once the private church of the baronial von Behr family.
