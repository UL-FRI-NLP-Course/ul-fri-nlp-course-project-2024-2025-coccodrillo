Rīga Ghetto & Latvian Holocaust Museum | Maskavas Forštate, Avotu Iela & Grīziņkalns, Rīga |  The centrepiece of this arresting and challenging museum is a wooden house with a reconstructed flat, like those that Jews had to move into when the Nazis established a ghetto in this area of Rīga in 1941. The central courtyard has a railway wagon similar to the kind that brought Jews from Germany to Rīga to be killed. Nearby, there is a photographic exhibition detailing the Holocaust in Latvia with the faces of those killed.
Elsewhere, well-curated exhibitions explore the Holocaust across Europe. A tiny on-site cafe offers kosher refreshments.
