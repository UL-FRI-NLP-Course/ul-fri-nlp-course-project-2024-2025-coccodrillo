Holocaust Memorial | Maskavas Forštate, Avotu Iela & Grīziņkalns, Rīga |  This moving Holocaust Memorial is on the site of a large 1871 synagogue that was burned to the ground on 4 July, 1941 during WWII, with the entire congregation locked inside. No one survived and all that remains today is the foundation. A concrete monument is dedicated to the Latvians who risked their lives to help hide Jews during the war.
