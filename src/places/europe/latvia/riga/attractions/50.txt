Rīga Motor Museum | Rīga, Latvia |  The stars of the collection at this surprisingly well-funded and engrossing museum are cars that once belonged to Soviet luminaries such as Gorky, Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev, complete with irreverent life-sized figures of the men themselves. Stalin's armoured limousine drank a litre of petrol every 2.5km. Also worthwhile is the hall on the lives of Soviet citizens and their cars. Takes buses 5 and 15.
