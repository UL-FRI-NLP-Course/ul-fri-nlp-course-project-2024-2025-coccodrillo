Jaunmoku Castle | Latvia, Europe |  Built as hunting palace by Latvia's most celebrated Englishman, RÄ«ga mayor George Armitstead, Jaunmoku Castle looks like a fantasy themed on his father's native Yorkshire. There is a interesting small museum, a nice park and a not-so-great hotel on the premises.
