Cape Kolka Point | Latvia, Europe |  Watching the Baltic swells crash into the blue swells of the Gulf of RÄ«ga is mesmerising. Find a spot away from the summertime crowds on the narrow beach; a 1km trail follows the beach southwest to the more serene environs of the Pine Trail, where there is uncrowded free parking. Local vendors sell crafts from small stalls.
