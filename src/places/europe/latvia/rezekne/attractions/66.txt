Green Synagogue | Latvia, Europe |  Close to Latgales iela and the old Jewish quarter, this 1845 synagogue is indeed green. Restored inside and out to past wooden glory, there are displays about local Jewish culture through the centuries and the stolid wooden architecture popular throughout Latgale. There's a good cafe across the street.
