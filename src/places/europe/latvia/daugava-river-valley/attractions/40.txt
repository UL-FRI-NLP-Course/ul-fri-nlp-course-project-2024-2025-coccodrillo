Garden of Destiny | Southern Latvia, Latvia |  Grandly named the Garden of Destiny, this sprawling project on an island in the river celebrates Latvia as a nation and opened for the centennial in 2018. Designed by acclaimed Japanese gardener-cum-philosopher Shunmyu Masuno, a 2.5km trail links areas with portentous names such as Alley of Destiny, House of Silence and Stream of Tears. Still a work in progress, there are vast new gardens and features that honour the country while recalling recent history.
