Sveta Petka Samardzhiiska Church | Sofia, Bulgaria |  This tiny church, located in the centre of the Serdika metro complex, was built during the early years of Ottoman rule (late 14th century), which explains its sunken profile and inconspicuous exterior. Inside are some 16th-century murals. Itâ€™s rumoured that the Bulgarian national hero Vasil Levski is buried here.
