Sveti Nikolai Russian Church | Sofia, Bulgaria |  This beautiful church with glittering mosaic exterior and golden domes was completed in 1914 for Sofia’s Russian community, and named in honour of St Nikolai, the ‘miracle worker’. Students believe that the saint brings them luck, so they go there to pray prior to important exams. The cramped interior features icons painted between the 11th and 14th centuries.
