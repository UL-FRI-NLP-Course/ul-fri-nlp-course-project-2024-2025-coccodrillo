Kulata Ethnological Complex | Bulgaria, Europe |  Just down from Tyulbe Park and the Thracian tomb, you’ll find the appealing Kulata (Tower) district, site of the Kulata Ethnological Complex. A replica of a 19th-century one-storey peasant’s home and wooden sheds with agricultural implements and carts are among the rustic exhibits.
A courtyard leads to the two-storey House of Hadzhi Eno, built by a wealthy rose merchant in Bulgarian National Revival–period style. Some explanation in German and English is available, and you may be invited by the caretaker to sample some rose tea, liquor or jam.
