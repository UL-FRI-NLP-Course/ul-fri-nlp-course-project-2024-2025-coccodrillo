Oslekov House | Bulgaria, Europe |  With its triple-arched entrance and interior restored in shades from scarlet to sapphire blue, Oslekov House is arguably the most beautifully restored example of Bulgarian National Revivalâ€“period architecture in Koprivshtitsa. It was built between 1853 and 1856 by a rich merchant who was executed after his arrest during the 1876 April Uprising. Now a house-museum, it features informative, multilingual displays (in Bulgarian, English and French) about 19th-century Bulgaria.
The museum includes some interesting background on the celep livestock merchant community, who were among the Bulgarian Revival's early influencers.
