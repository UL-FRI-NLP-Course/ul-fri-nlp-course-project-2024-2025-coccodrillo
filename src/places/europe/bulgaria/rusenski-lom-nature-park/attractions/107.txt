Orlova Chuka Cave | Bulgaria, Europe |  Lying 2km from Peplina village, the country's second-longest cave is accessible for around 3km of its length. Visitors pass through several chambers, the first called the 'Concert Hall' for its good acoustics. Entry is by guided tour only, taking place at even-numbered hours throughout the day. Guides rarely speak English, but anyway the real attraction here is the natural beauty of the cave.
