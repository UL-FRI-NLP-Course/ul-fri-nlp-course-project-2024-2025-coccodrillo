Primorski Park | Varna, Bulgaria |  Established in 1878, this large and attractive green space, overlooking the sea, stretches for about 8km and is said to be the largest of its kind in Europe. It’s full of promenading families and old women knitting lace in summer, and there’s always something going on. In addition to greenery and views, the park is home to the city's aquarium, zoo park and planetarium.
