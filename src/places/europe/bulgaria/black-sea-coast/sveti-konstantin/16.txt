Sveti Konstantin & Elena Monastery | Black Sea Coast, Bulgaria |  This tiny church and monastery was built in the early 18th century on the site of a holy healing spring, though it has been rebuilt and remodelled since then. The spring remains, under the communion table. The church houses relics of St Valentine, as well as its patron saints.
