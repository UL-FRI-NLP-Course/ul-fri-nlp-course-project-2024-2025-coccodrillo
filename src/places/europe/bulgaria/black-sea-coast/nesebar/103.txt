Sveta Bogoroditsa Church | Black Sea Coast, Bulgaria |  This relatively plain 19th-century church is the only functioning one in town and modestly dressed visitors are welcome. (Shawls are provided at the entrance for bare-armed women.) The typically colourful interior is splashed with saintly murals, and if you still haven’t seen enough icons, there’s a small church museum attached, with examples going back to the 13th century.
