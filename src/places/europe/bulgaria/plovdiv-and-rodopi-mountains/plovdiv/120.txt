Hindlian House | Plovdiv, Bulgaria |  Once owned by merchant Stepan Hindlian, this opulent house was built between 1835 and 1840. It’s full of exquisite period furniture and walls painted with real and imaginary landscapes of Venice, Alexandria and Constantinople. The magnificent panelled ceilings and ‘Oriental-style’ marble bathroom, with its domed ceiling and skylight, are high points.
