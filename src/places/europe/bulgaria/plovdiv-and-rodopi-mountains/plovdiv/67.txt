Ethnographical Museum | Plovdiv, Bulgaria |  Even if you don't have time to step inside, it would be criminal to leave Plovdiv's old town without glancing into the courtyard of this stunning National Revivalâ€“era building. Well-manicured flower gardens surround a navy-blue mansion ornamented with golden filigree and topped with a distinctive peaked roof. There is more to admire inside, especially the upper floor's sunshine-yellow walls and carved wooden ceiling hovering above displays of regional costumes.
The ground-floor displays of agrarian instruments are a shade less interesting.
