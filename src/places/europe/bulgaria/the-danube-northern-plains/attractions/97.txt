Lopushanski Monastery | Bulgaria, Europe |  Some 21km west of Montana, near the village of Georgi Damyanovo, this small monastery, completed in 1853, enjoys a serene setting and holds icons painted by brothers Stanislav and Nikolai Dospevski. During the periodic rebellions against Ottoman rule, Lopushanski (also known as St John the Precursor) provided a safe haven for revolutionaries. There's a small guesthouse and cafe.
