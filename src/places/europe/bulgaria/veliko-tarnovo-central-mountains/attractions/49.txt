Preobrazhenski Monastery | Bulgaria, Europe |  Outstanding clifftop views compete with murals by renowned painter Zahari Zograf at this serene monastery, 7km north of Veliko Târnovo. It was officially founded in 1360, though its origins extend 200 years earlier. Like many Bulgarian monasteries, it was destroyed under Ottoman rule. Rebuilt in 1825, its Zograf murals (painted 1849–51) include a wheel of life and menacing scenes between demons and sinners. It was spared annihilation by a 1991 landslide (note the boulders either side of the church).
