Historical Museum | Bulgaria, Europe |  The museum within Dryanovo Monastery is devoted mostly to the 1876 April uprising and the Russo-Turkish War, and the monastery's role in safeguarding the rebels. Sobering displays include the skulls of Bulgarian resistance fighters slaughtered by the Ottomans, and 19th-century weapons. Downstairs are artefacts from nearby caves, including Bacho Kiro, and some icons.
