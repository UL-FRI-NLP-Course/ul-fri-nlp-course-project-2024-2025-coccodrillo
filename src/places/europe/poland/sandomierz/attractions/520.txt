Opatów Gate | Małopolska, Poland |  The main entrance to the Old Town, and the only surviving gate of the four originally built, is 14th-century Opatów Gate. You can climb to the viewing platform at the top for a pleasant (though by no means bird’s-eye) view of surrounding terrain and adjoining fragments of defensive walls.
