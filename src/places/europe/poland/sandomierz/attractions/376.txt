Underground Tourist Route | Małopolska, Poland |  A 40-minute guided tour (in Polish) leads through a chain of 30-odd cellars tidily connected over 500m beneath the Old Town. The cellars – originally used for storage and sometimes for shelter during times of conflict – were built between the 13th and 17th centuries. The deepest point is about 12m below ground, but it feels like more, because of disorienting twists, turns and Escher-esque staircases.
