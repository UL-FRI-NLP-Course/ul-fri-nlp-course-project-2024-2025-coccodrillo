Franciscan Church of St Mary Magdalene | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  This beautifully evocative church, with its enormous pillars dwarfing the three baroque statues at the front, was built between 1754 and 1778 in late-baroque and classical style. The church has a beautiful rococo interior with a vaulted and frescoed nave.
