Museum of the History of the City of Przemyśl | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  Rynek 9, a dignified early 16th-century tenement house on Przemyśl's market square, is the venue for this intriguing and well-curated museum of the city's history. Exhibitions trace both the turbulent and settled periods of the city's past, extending into 16th-century cellars and rooms of the similarly venerable tenement behind, at Serbańska 7.
