New Synagogue | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  The more important of two synagogues that survived WWII (four existed previously), the New Synagogue was built in the early 20th century. It was used as a horse stable by the Germans during the war, later as a textile factory and a branch of the public library, and is now empty.
