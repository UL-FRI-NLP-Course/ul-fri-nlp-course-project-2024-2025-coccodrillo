Bia≈Çystok Cathedral | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  This grand neo-Gothic brick cathedral dates from 1905. It's attached to a late-Renaissance parish church (1627) with a fascinating interior and an 18th-century baroque presbytery. The story goes that the large church was attached to the older church to get around a Russian ban on building new Catholic churches.
