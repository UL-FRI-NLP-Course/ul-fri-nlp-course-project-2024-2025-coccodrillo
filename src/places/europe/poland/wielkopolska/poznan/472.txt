Museum of Musical Instruments | Pozna≈Ñ, Poland |  When we last visited, this museum was undergoing restoration and scheduled to reopen in August 2019. Based on past exhibits, you can expect hundreds of instruments, from whistles to concert pianos, including intriguing musical devices such as a typewriter for musician notation and a polyphon, the precursor of the record player.
