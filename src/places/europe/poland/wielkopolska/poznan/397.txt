Archaeological Museum | Poznań, Poland |  Located off the southeastern corner of the Rynek, inside the 16th-century Górka Palace. Before going in, stop and have a look at the fine Renaissance doorway on the building’s eastern facade. The museum presents the prehistory of the region, from the Stone Age to the early medieval period, as well as housing an extensive Egyptian collection.
