Poznań Army Museum | Poznań, Poland |  The focus of this museum is mainly on the history of the Polish army between WWI and WWII. Here you can find weapons, banners and uniforms, as well as lots of photographs, all inside an unusual bunker-like structure. Buses 176 and 603 are useful for reaching Citadel Park (Park Cytadela) and the museum as they run the length of Garbary.
