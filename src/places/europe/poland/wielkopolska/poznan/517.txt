Museum of Poznań June 1956 | Poznań, Poland |  Within the grand neo-Romanesque Kaiserhaus built from 1904 to 1910 for German Emperor Wilhelm II, this museum offers details of the massive 1956 workers' strike in Poznań. Entering this is like stepping back into 1956, but descriptions are only in Polish.
