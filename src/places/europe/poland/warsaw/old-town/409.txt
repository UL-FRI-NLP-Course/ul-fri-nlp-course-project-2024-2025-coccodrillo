Field Cathedral of the Polish Army | Warsaw, Poland |  One of Warsaw's most interesting churches is this traditional place of worship for soldiers. Thereâ€™s no homage to the glory of war here; instead some impressive memorials and numerous plaques to fallen Polish soldiers, including a chapel dedicated to the thousands murdered in the Katyn Massacre and other incidents through WWII. Head to the crypt to find the small museum.
