Mosaic House | Warsaw, Poland |  Covering much of the end of the tenement building, this striking ceramic-tile mosaic, designed in 1956 by Zofia Czarnocka-Kowalska, combines classical Greek poses with socialist realist art to depict heroic men and women at work and play.
Nearby, look for the more avant-garde 1950s mosaic design by Roman Artymowski on the building at ul Mostowa 2.
