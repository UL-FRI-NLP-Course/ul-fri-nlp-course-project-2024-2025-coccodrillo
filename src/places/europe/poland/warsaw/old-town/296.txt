Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature | Warsaw, Poland |  Occupying two historic tenement buildings in the Old Town Sq, this museum does a good job of covering the life and times of Poland's national poet Adam Mickiewicz (1798â€“1855). The exhibition spans several rooms, includes some original manuscripts and paintings of the romantic poet, and has good English captions.
The Lithuanian-born Mickiewicz, who spent very little time in modern-day Poland, is the author of the national epic poem Pan Tadeusz.
