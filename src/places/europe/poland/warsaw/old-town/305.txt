Barbican | Warsaw, Poland |  The red-brick Barbican, a semicircular defensive tower topped with a decorative Renaissance parapet, is part of the medieval fortifications surrounding the Old Town. It was partially dismantled in the 19th century but reconstructed after WWII â€“ something you can learn about in the exhibition inside the tower, which covers the history of the Old Town walls.
The path running through the Barbican is a popular spot for buskers and art and craft sellers.
