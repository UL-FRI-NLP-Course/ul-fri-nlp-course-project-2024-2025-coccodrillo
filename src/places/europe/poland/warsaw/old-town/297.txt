Marie Skłodowska-Curie Museum | Warsaw, Poland |  The first woman to win the Nobel Prize, Marie Curie was born in this building in 1867 and lived here for her first 19 years. It is now a small museum chronicling the life and work of the distinguished scientist and displaying items from Marie and her husband Pierre’s laboratory as well as other memorabilia. Unfortunately, there are sparse English captions.
A short walk away is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Monument.
