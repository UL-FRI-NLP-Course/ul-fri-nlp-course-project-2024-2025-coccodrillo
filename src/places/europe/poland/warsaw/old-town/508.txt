Little Insurgent Monument | Warsaw, Poland |  Commemorating the child soldiers who fought and died during the Warsaw Rising, this poignant statue is of a boy wearing an adult helmet and holding a submachine gun. Designed by Polish sculptor Jerzy Jarnuszkiewicz, it was modelled on the 13-year-old soldier code-named 'Antek' who died on 8 August 1944.
