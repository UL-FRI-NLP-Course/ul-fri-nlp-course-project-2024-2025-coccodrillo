St Anne's Church | Warsaw, Poland |  A church has stood on this spot since the 14th century, but the neo-rennaissance St Anne's you see today dates to 1870. The tombs of the Potocki and Branicki families, one-time owners of Wilan√≥w Palace, are here as well as a giant mammoth bone, discovered on the site when the foundations of the building were being laid.
