Park Żeromskiego | Warsaw, Poland |  This prettily landscaped park includes a good children's playground; Sokolnicki FORT Arts Center (https://fortevent.com), an events space based in a 19th-century brick fortress; and the Museum of Children's Art (www.muzeumsztukidziecka.pl).
Also here is the popular cafe-bar Prochownia Żoliborz.
