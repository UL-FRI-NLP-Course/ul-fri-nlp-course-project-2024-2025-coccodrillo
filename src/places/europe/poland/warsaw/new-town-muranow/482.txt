Keret House | Warsaw, Poland |  It's easy to completely miss what has to be Warsaw's narrowest building, measuring between 70cm and 122cm width. Dedicated to the Israeli writer Edgar Keret, the 2012 art installation, designed by Jakub Szczęsny, mainly acts as an artists' residency and is very occasionally open for tours – see the website for details.
