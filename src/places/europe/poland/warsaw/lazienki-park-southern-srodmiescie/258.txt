Ujazdów Castle Centre for Contemporary Art | Warsaw, Poland |  Interesting and creatively quirky arts events, including exhibitions, performance art and large-scale installations, are all staged within the Ujazdów Castle. The current building is a 1970s recreation of the castle as it was in its 18th-century guise, but there has been a fort on the bluff above the Vistula here since the 13th century.
Also in the castle are a couple of good cafes, the fine Art Bookstore and the art-house cinema Kino.Lab.
