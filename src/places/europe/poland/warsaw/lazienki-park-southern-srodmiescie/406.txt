Volleyball Player Neon | Warsaw, Poland |  Perhaps Warsaw's most iconic neon is this animation of a girl throwing a volleyball, designed by Jan Mucharski in 1960 and hanging off the corner of a building on Plac Konstytucji.
A relic of the golden age of ul Marsza≈Çkowska's 'neonisation', it was restored in 2006 thanks to a private initiative by the owners of the Neon Museum.
