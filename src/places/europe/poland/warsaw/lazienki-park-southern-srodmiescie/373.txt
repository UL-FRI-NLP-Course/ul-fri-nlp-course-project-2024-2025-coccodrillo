Museum of Life Under Communism | Warsaw, Poland |  This small, privately run museum, devoted to the communist period in Poland's history, has found its spiritual home situated over a KFC and overlooking socialist realist Plac Konstytucji. There's a year-by-year timeline and a focus on different aspects of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Poland (PRL) from politics to fashion. It's all attractively laid out and, by Warsaw standards, not too overwhelming to digest.
