Rusa≈Çka Beach | Warsaw, Poland |  There's a great view of the Old Town skyline from this popular beach on the east bank of the Vistula, close by the zoo. Several cafe-bars set up on the sand for the spring to autumn season. In the warmer months you can also catch a free ferry from here across to the Multimedia Fountain Park.
