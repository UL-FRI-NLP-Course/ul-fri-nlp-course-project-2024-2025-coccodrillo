Former Mikveh | Warsaw, Poland |  A mikveh is a bath used by religious Jewish women for monthly ritual cleansing – this red-brick building completed in 1913 used to contain one and stood next to the long-destroyed Round Synagogue that once occupied the small adjacent park.
The building is owned by the Jewish Religious Community of Warsaw and houses the Jacek Kuroń Multicultural Humanistic High School.
