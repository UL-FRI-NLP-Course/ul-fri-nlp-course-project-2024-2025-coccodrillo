St Mary Magdalene Cathedral | Warsaw, Poland |  It's impossible to miss the five onion-shaped domes of Warsaw's main Polish Orthodox cathedral. Built in 1869 to serve the growing number of Russians arriving to live in Praga, its interior dazzles with gilded frescoes and multiple icons. If the main church is not open, you will still be able to see the beautifully painted chapel in the basement.
