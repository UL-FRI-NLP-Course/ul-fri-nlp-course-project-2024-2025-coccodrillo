Warsaw University | Warsaw, Poland |  The central campus of Warsaw University was founded in 1816, although its oldest building, the Kazimierz Palace, dates from 1634. With its leafy avenues and smiling students, it appears a peaceful place, but like any good university it has been a breeding ground for independent thought and the site of many student protests.
