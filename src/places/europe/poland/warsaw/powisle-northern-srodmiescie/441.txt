Palm | Warsaw, Poland |  If this stout palm tree growing out of the centre of the De Gaulle roundabout seems like a horticultural anomaly, you'd be correct: it's an artwork with a trunk of steel and polyethylene fronds. Entitled Greetings from Jerusalem, the palm, created by Joanna Rajkowska, was unveiled in 2002 and has since become a beloved city landmark.
