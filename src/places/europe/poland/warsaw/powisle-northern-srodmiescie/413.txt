ZODIAK Warsaw Pavilion of Architecture | Warsaw, Poland |  Occupying a revamped 1960s building on which hangs a wonderful retro neon sign, this exhibition and information space promotes aspects of Warsaw's built environment past and present. Kosmos, the new mosaic designed by Magdalena Łapińska-Rozenbaum that covers the stairwell, is a homage to an old mosaic that originally covered the terrace wall of the pavilion.
