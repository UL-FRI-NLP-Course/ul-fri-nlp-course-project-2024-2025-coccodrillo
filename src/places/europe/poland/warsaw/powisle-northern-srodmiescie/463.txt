Kora Mural | Warsaw, Poland |  Bruno Althamer painted this walled mural of the rock star Kora, who died of ovarian cancer in 2018. The image's clever integration with a nearby tree will see Kora's hair 'grow' along with the tree's leaves.
Find it behind the Branicki Palace near the Pawilony complex of bars and cafes.
