Vodka Museum | Warsaw, Poland |  This small but attractive museum, hiding in a courtyard off the street, comprises mostly glass cases displaying a beautiful collection of old vodka bottles and glasses, as well as labels, advertising posters and the like. A self-guided tour (audio guide 7z≈Ç) provides a comprehensive history of Polish vodka, and can be followed by a tasting of three vodkas (you'll pay extra for premium and super-premium brand tastings).
