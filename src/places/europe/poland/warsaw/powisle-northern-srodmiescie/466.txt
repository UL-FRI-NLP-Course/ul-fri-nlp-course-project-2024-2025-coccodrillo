Tomb of the Unknown Soldier | Warsaw, Poland |  Dedicated to the unknown soldiers who have given their lives for Poland, this military memorial occupies the last remnant of the Saxon Palace that stood here until it was destroyed by the Germans in WWII. In a marching ceremony across the square, the pair of soldiers who guard the eternal flame are changed every hour on the hour.
