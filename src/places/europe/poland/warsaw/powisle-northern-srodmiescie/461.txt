Visitationist Church | Warsaw, Poland |  Childhood prodigy Frédéric Chopin regularly played the organ at this church, completed in 1761, which is a prime example of rococo architecture. The interior features a boat-shaped pulpit and plenty more artistic flourishes.
In front of the church is a statue of Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, Poland's primate from 1948 to 1981.
