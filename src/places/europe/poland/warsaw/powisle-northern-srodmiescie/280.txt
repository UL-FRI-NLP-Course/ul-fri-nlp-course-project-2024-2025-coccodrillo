Piłsudski Square | Warsaw, Poland |  Warsaw's largest public square once stood in front of the Saxon Palace, destroyed during WWII. The only part of the palace that remains is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
As well as the tomb, the square is punctuated by the Krzyż Papieski, a stone cross marking the spot where on 2 June 1979 Pope John Paul II celebrated the Holy Mass, and the Smoleńsk Air Disaster Monument.
