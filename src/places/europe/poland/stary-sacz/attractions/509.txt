Parish Church of St Elizabeth of Hungary | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  The Parish Church of St Elizabeth of Hungary is two blocks south of the Rynek and dates from the townâ€™s 13th-century beginnings. It's been altered considerably over the years, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, and is now a textbook example of unbridled baroque, with five big florid altars.
