Market Gate | Gda≈Ñsk & Pomerania, Poland |  The northern entrance to the Old Town was once through the Market Gate, the only surviving gate from the medieval fortifications. In front of it is a statue of a baker who legendarily saved the town in the 16th century when he spotted the approaching Teutonic Knights, bent on invasion, and cut the ropes that held the gates open. The tower houses a seasonal tourist office and is worth the climb to the top for views across the town.
