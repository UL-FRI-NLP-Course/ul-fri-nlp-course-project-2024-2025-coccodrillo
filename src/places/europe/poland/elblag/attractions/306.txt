Galeria El | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Some 200m to the north of Market Gate is Galeria El, formerly St Mary’s Church. A massive Gothic brick structure, the original church was gutted and now houses a gallery of contemporary art, with occasional concerts and events. It’s worth a visit just to see the imposing interior and the large modern-art objects dotting the grounds, including a monster supermarket trolley and some bashed cubes of XXL proportions.
