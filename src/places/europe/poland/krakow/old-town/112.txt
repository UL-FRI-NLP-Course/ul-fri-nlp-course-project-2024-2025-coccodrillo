Papal Window | Kraków, Poland |  When visiting Kraków, Pope John Paul II used to address his followers from this window of the Bishop's Palace, overlooking ul Franciszkańska. The area is filled with candles on important anniversaries, such as the former pope's birthday and anniversary of his death. These days, there's a photo of John Paul II in the window to keep his memory alive.
