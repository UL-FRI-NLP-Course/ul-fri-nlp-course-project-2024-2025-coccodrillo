Holy Trinity Basilica | Krak√≥w, Poland |  Originally built in the 13th century, this massive church was badly damaged by fire in 1850. Note the original 14th-century doorway at the main (western) entrance to the church. The monastery, just behind the northern wall of the church, is accessible from the street (enter an unmarked door at Stolarska 12). Closed to tourists during Sunday mass.
