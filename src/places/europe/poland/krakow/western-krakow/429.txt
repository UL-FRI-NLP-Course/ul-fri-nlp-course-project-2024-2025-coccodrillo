Europeum | Krak√≥w, Poland |  This oft-overlooked museum, housed in an old granary, holds the National Museum's most important collection of European paintings. Around 100 works are on display, covering seven centuries of European art. Important paintings include Lorenzo Lotto's Adoration of the Infant Jesus (early 16th century) and a work by Pieter Brueghel the Younger.
