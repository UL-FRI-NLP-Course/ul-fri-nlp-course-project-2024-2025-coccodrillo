Archaeological Museum | Kraków, Poland |  You can learn about the Małopolska region's history from the Palaeolithic period up until the early Middle Ages here, but you’ll be most enthralled by the collection of ancient Egyptian artefacts, including both human and animal mummies. There are also more than 4000 iron coins from the 9th century. The gardens are a lovely place for a stroll.
