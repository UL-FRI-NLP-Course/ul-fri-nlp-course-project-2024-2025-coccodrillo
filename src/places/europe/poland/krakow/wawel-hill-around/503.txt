Kraków Pinball Museum | Kraków, Poland |  All-you-can-eat pinball. A basement filled with retro pinball machines and video games from your youth (if you happened to grow up anywhere from the 1960s through the 1990s) that you can play as much as you like. This makes the relatively high entry fee worth it only if you're up for at least a few games.
