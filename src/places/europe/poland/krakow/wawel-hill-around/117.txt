Church of St Andrew | Kraków, Poland |  This church is almost a thousand years old. Built towards the end of the 11th century, much of its austere Romanesque stone exterior has been preserved. As soon as you enter, though, you’re in a totally different world; its small interior was subjected to a radical baroque overhaul in the 18th century.
