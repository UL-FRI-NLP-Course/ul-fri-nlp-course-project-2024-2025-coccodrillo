Bishop Erazm Ciołek Palace | Kraków, Poland |  Quaint Kanonicza is the perfect street to put a palace and fill it with age-old paintings and sculptures. This newish branch of the National Museum contains two exhibits of religious artwork. The Art of Old Poland (12th to 18th centuries) includes loads of Gothic paintings, altar pieces and a room devoted to sculptor Veit Stoss. A second exhibit focuses on Orthodox art.
