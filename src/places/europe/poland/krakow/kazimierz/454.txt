Temple Synagogue | Krak√≥w, Poland |  One of the quarter's most visually arresting synagogues, the Temple dates from the mid-19th century. It was built in Moorish style and then given a lavish makeover in the past 20 years after being partially destroyed by the occupying Germany army in WWII. It's inactive these days, but still holds occasional concerts and special events.
