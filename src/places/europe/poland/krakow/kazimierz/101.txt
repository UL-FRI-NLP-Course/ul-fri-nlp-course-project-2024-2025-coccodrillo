Isaac Synagogue | Kraków, Poland |  Near the southwestern edge of the Remuh Cemetery is Kraków’s largest synagogue, dated from 1638. Following partial destruction in WWII, it was returned to the Jewish community in 1989. Inside you can see the remains of the original stucco work and wall-painting. The synagogue has been restored and now houses a modest exhibition titled 'In Memory of Polish Jews'. There's also a small kosher food shop on the premises.
