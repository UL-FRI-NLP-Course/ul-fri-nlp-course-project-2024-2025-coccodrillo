Museum of the Factory | Łódź, Poland |  This industrial museum within the Manufaktura complex shows Łódź factories at their productive best, when they made goods to be sold rather than served as venues for goods for sale. There are old textile machines, fascinating maps and a short video of the textile king himself, Izrael Kalmanowicz Poznański. An observation deck allows you to survey Manufaktura, his factory empire.
