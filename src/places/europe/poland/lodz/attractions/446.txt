MS2 Museum of Art | Łódź, Poland |  This gallery in the Manufaktura complex houses the city's impressive collection of experimental and avant-garde works from the 20th and 21st centuries. The setting, a former textile mill on the edge of the Manufaktura mall, is a treat. There's a good in-house cafe. A combined ticket for MS1, MS2 and Herbst Palace costs adult/child 30/20zł.
