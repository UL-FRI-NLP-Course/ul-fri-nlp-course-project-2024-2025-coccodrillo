Experymentarium | Łódź, Poland |  Seemingly designed for kids and high-school science nerds, this interactive science museum in Manufaktura is a blast at any age. The exhibits are built around staid subjects such as chemistry and astronomy, but the displays encourage visitors to touch, play and learn. Explore the cosmic tunnel, laser games and optical illusions.
