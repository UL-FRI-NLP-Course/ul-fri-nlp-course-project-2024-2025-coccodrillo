Museum of Fishery | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Hel’s Gothic church dates from the 1420s, making it the oldest building in town. Pews and monstrances have given way to recently revamped exhibits on fishing and boat-building, a display of stuffed sea birds and a collection of old fishing boats, all part of the National Maritime Museum. The tower provides views of the peninsula and Gulf of Gdańsk.
