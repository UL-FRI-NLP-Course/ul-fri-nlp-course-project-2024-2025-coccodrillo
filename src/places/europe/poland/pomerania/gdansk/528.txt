Market Hall | Gda≈Ñsk, Poland |  Built on the site of a Dominican monastery, the late-19th-century Market Hall is more interesting for its wrought-iron railway-station architecture than for the procession of butchers, bakers and quick-buck makers inside. In the basement lurk the dusty remnants of the monastery.
