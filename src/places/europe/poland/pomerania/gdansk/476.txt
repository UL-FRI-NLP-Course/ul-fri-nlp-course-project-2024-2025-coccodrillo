Amber Museum | Gda≈Ñsk, Poland |  This museum is dedicated to all things amber and the craft of designing and creating amber jewellery. It's located in the Foregate, a former prison and torture chamber, so in addition to amber displays, there are also some startlingly realistic displays of torture chambers. Two for one!
