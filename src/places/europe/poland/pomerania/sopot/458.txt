Ulica Bohaterów Monte Cassino | Sopot, Poland |  Sopot’s unavoidable spine is 'Heroes of Monte Cassino' Street, an attractive and invariably crowded mall stretching from the railway line to the pier. Many of Sopot’s cafes and places of entertainment line its pedestrianised length, some of which can be found in the unmissable Crooked House.
