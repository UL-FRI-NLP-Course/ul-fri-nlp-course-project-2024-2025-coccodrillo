Tightrope Walker Statue | Sopot, Poland |  While ambling your way along ul Bohater√≥w Monte Cassino towards the sea, take a right into ul Bema to see one of the most unusual statues in the Tri-City. An African fisherman carrying a net is suspended above the street on a tightrope, the piece of public art seeming to defy gravity. It's the work of Polish sculptor Jerzy Kedziora who specialises in these odd balancing spectacles.
