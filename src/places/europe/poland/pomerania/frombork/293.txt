Nicolaus Copernicus Museum | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  The Cathedral Hill complex (Wzgórze Katedralne) is today the Nicolaus Copernicus Museum. It covers several sights within the fortified complex, each visited on a separate ticket; the cathedral and the Old Bishops' Palace are the main two sights. The entrance is from the southern side through the massive Main Gate (Brama Główna), where you’ll find the ticket office.
