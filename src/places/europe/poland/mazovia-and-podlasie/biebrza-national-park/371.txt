Red Marsh | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  One of Biebrza's most important areas, the Red Marsh (Czerwone Bagno) in the Middle Basin is a strictly protected area of bog forest. A 1km educational trail ends overlooking the marsh, from where you can fully appreciate the natural beauty and if you have great luck, spot one of 400 resident elk. The trail begins near GrzÄ™dy; ask at the visitor centre for directions.
