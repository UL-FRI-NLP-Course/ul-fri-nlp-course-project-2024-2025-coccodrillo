Talmudic House | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  Standing opposite the synagogue, this small structure dates to 1772. It houses an annex of the Tykocin Museum and is where you buy tickets. The permanent exhibition recreates the life and work of Zygmunt Bujnowski, a local painter who achieved some fame before his death in 1927. There is also a reconstructed one-room pharmacy and various special exhibitions. The audioguide is essential for bringing the exhibits to life.
