City Hall | Mazovia & Podlasie, Poland |  The old market square is dominated by this attractive building at its northwest end. From atop the town hall, a trumpeter plays at noon and 6pm each day. As an added spectacle for the noon event, a mechanical King Władysław Herman knights his son Bolesław Krzywousty.
