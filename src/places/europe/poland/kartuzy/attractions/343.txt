Kashubian Museum | Gda≈Ñsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Slavophiles should make a beeline for this surprisingly good and delightfully old-school three-storey museum, south of the train station near the tracks. Amid the inevitable wooden farm implements, kitchen utensils and fishing paraphernalia there are some beautiful toffee-brown and metallic-black pottery so typical of the region, wonderfully embroidered textiles, wood carvings, hefty rural furniture and folksy children's toys.
