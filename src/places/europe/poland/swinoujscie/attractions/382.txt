Lighthouse | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  The Baltic's highest lighthouse rises 64.8m into the northern sky on the opposite side of the channel to the main town. Dating from 1857, there are 308 exhausting steps to the top but the view up and down the coast is well worth the climb. There's also an exhibition on the maritime rescue service and lighthouses. The easiest way to reach the lighthouse is to stay on the train to Świnoujście Port.
