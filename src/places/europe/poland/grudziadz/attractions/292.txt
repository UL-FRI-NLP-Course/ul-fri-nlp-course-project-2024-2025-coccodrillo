Granaries | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  The extraordinary row of crumbling granaries was built along the length of the town’s waterfront to provide storage and protect the town from invaders. Begun in the 14th century, they were gradually rebuilt and extended until the 18th century, and some were later turned into housing blocks by knocking through windows in the walls. These massive buttressed brick buildings – most of them six storeys high – are an impressive sight rising high above the Vistula.
