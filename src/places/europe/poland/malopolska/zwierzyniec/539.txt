Zwierzyniec Brewery | Małopolska, Poland |  The local brewery is owned by national giant Perła. It makes popular Czech-style Zwierzyniec lager. Tours of the brewery, which is right on the lake, trace its history going back to the 1600s. There is a summer beer garden outside that shows movies on balmy nights.
