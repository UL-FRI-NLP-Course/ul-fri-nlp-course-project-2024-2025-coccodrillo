Museum Jacek Malczewski | Ma≈Çopolska, Poland |  Housed in a grand 18th-century collegiate building on the Rynek, this museum displays a collection of art by local painters, including its namesake Jacek Malczewski. Other exhibits cover local history, archaeology and, yes, even stamps. It's eclectic and oddly compelling. The facade features a mismatched jumble of plaques honoring local luminaries.
