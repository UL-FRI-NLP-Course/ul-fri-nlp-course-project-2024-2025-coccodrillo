Zamoyski Palace | Małopolska, Poland |  This former palace (closed to the public) was the main residence of Jan Zamoyski, and dates from 1586. It was built in accordance with Bernardo Morando’s design concept for the town, but it lost much of its character when it was converted into a military hospital in the 1830s. These days it houses the municipal court. Most notable is a large statue of Zamoyski astride a horse on the building's east side.
