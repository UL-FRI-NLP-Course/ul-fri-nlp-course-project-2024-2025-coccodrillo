Church of St Bartholomew | Kraków, Poland |  The small, shingled Church of St Bartholomew dates from the mid-15th century, which makes it Poland’s oldest surviving three-nave timber church. It was one of only two churches available to workers near Nowa Huta, until the Arka Pana church was finished in 1977.
