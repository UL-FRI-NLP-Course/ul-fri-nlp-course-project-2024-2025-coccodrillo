Teatr Ludowy | Krak√≥w, Poland |  Nowa Huta's socialist-realistic architectural aesthetic extends to the area's main theatre, which was built in 1955. Early shows may have been dedicated to extolling the virtues of the proletariat, but these days the theatre is especially known for its experimental, avant-garde productions.
