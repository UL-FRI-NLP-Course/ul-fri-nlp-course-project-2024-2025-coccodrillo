Plac Centralny | Krak√≥w, Poland |  This sprawling square and tram stop serves as the centrepoint of the Nowa Huta workers' housing estate. The square dates from 1949, and the buildings here are among the oldest and grandest of the entire communist-era building project. A statue of Russian communist leader Vladimir Lenin once stood here; Lenin must be rolling in his tomb these days. In 2004, officials decided to rename the square to honour the former US president, Ronald Reagan.
