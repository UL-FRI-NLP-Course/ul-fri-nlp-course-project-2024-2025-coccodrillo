Castle | Małopolska, Poland |  Above the parish church along ul Zamkowa is what's left of Kazimierz Dolny’s castle. Originally built in 1341 as a stronghold against the Tatar incursion, the castle was extended in the 16th century and embellished further during the Renaissance. The castle fell into ruin after its partial destruction by the Swedes; the remaining fragments offer a pleasant view over the town and the Vistula.
