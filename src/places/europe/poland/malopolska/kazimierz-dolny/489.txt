Houses of the Przybyła Brothers | Małopolska, Poland |  The massively restored two adjoining Houses of the Przybyła Brothers, built in 1615 by brothers Mikołaj and Krzysztof, feature rich Renaissance, mannerist facades. Decorations on the restored facade depict the brothers’ patron saints, St Nicholas (guardian of traders) and St Christopher (guardian of travellers).
