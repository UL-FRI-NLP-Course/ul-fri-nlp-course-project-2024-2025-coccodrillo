House of the Celej Family | Małopolska, Poland |  This 1635 townhouse built for the Celej family is a branch of the Vistula River Museum. The focus is on art and several rooms on the upper floor are dedicated to the considerable output of artists who have called Kazimierz Dolny home. Some of the works are fantastic, some merely interesting, but the collection amply demonstrates the town’s role in Poland’s artistic history. The exterior is under massive renovation through 2020.
