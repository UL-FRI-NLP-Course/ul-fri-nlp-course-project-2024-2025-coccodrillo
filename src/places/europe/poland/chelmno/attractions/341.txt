Church of the Assumption | Gda≈Ñsk & Pomerania, Poland |  Just off the Rynek, this massive, Gothic church was commissioned by the Teutonic Knights in the late 13th century. The magnificent interior is crammed with ornate baroque and rococo furnishings, and also holds some supposed relics of St Valentine, patron saint of lovers, locked within the right-hand pillar as you face the altar (this has inevitably spawned an entire miniature tourist industry and a raft of marketing campaigns).
