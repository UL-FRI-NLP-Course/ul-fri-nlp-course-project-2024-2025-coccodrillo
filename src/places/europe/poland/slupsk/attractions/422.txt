St Hyacinthus' Church | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  The 15th-century St Hyacinthus’ Church, aka St Jack’s as the tourist signposting would have it, is usually closed, though you can now peek in through a low glass window in the entrance to see the 20th-century stained glass and Gothic vaulting. Otherwise sneak in during a service or attend a summer organ concert, normally held midweek in July and August.
