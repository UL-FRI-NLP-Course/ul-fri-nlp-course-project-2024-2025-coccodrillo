Stutthof | Gdańsk & Pomerania, Poland |  At the very western end of the Mierzeja Wiślana is Sztutowo, known until 1945 as Stutthof. It's infamous as the location of the former extermination camp in which the Nazis disposed of Polish resisters from the beginning of WWII, and which later became part of their Final Solution against Jews. Nowadays it’s a sombre museum presenting exhibitions and documentaries about the German occupation of the region.
