The Anonymous Pedestrians | Wroc≈Çaw, Poland |  Also known as Passage, this arresting sculpture depicts seven bronze pedestrians literally being swallowed by the pavement, only to re-emerge on the other side of the street. It was created by Jerzy Kalina and unveiled in 2005 to mark the 24th anniversary of the declaration of martial law. Look for it 500m west of the train station.
