Arsenal | Wrocław, Poland |  Just outside the ring road encircling the Old Town, the squat brick Arsenal houses the Military Museum and the Archaeological Museum. With two towers and an enormous courtyard, the building – which originally served as a granary – is the most significant remnant of the city’s 15th-century fortifications.
