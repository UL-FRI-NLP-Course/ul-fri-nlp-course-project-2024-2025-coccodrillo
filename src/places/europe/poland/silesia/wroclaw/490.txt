White Stork Synagogue | Wrocław, Poland |  The restored White Stork Synagogue, built in exemplary classical style in 1829, is a reminder that this city was once home to more than 20,000 Jews. Restored by Wrocław's Jewish citizens from 1996, it now houses a permanent exhibition – History Reclaimed – on 800 years of Jewish life in Eastern Europe.
