National Museum | Wrocław, Poland |  Wrocław's National Museum is a treasure trove of fine art from across the ages. Medieval sculpture is displayed on the ground floor; exhibits include the Romanesque tympanum from the portal of the Church of St Mary Magdalene (which depicts the Assumption of the Virgin Mary), and 14th-century sarcophagi from the Church of SS Vincent & James. There are also collections of Silesian paintings, ceramics, silverware and furnishings from the 16th to 19th centuries.
The 2nd floor holds Polish art, mainly paintings, from the 17th century to the present. The collection covers most of Poland’s big names, including Jacek Malczewski, Stanisław Wyspiański, Witkacy (Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz) and Jan Matejko; be prepared for moody portraits and massive battle scenes. Among the modern painters, Władysław Hasior, Eugeniusz Stankiewicz-Get and Tadeusz Makowski are names to look out for, especially for their humorous takes on war and religion.
