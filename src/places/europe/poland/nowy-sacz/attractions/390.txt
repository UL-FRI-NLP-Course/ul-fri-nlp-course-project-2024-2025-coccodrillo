Synagogue | Carpathian Mountains, Poland |  For centuries Jews lived in the area north of the Rynek. This is also the area where the Germans built their wartime Jewish ghetto, before shipping 25,000 residents to extermination camps in 1942. Not much of the community or the ghetto remains, with the exception of this beautiful 18th-century synagogue, which miraculously survived the war and has now been restored as a place of worship.
