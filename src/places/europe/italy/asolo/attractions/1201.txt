Rocca | The Veneto, Italy |  Perched on the summit of Monte Ricco and looking down on central Asolo are the hulking ruins of a fortress dating back to the 12th to early 13th centuries. The still-visible cistern well was constructed between the 13th and 14th centuries, while the heavily restored buttresses offer a breathtaking panorama that takes in soft green hills, snow-capped mountains and the industrious Po Valley. At the time of writing, the fortress was closed for maintenance work.
