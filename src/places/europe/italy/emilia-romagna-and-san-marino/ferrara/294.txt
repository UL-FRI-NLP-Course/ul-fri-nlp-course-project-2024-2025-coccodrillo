Palazzo dei Diamanti | Ferrara, Italy |  Named after the spiky diamond-shaped ashlar stones on its facade, the late-15th-century 'diamond palace' was built for Sigismondo d'Este. It houses Ferrara's Pinacoteca Nazionale, where you can contemplate the genius of the 16th- to 17th-century â€˜Ferrara school'. High-profile special exhibits are held in the adjacent Spazio Espositivo.
