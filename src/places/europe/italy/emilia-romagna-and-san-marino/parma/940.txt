Palazzo della Pilotta | Parma, Italy |  Looming over the manicured lawns and modern fountains of Piazza della Pace, this monumental palace is hard to miss. Supposedly named after the Spanish ball game of pelota that was once played within its walls, it was originally built for the Farnese family between 1583 and 1622. Heavily bombed in WWII, it has since been largely rebuilt and today houses three museums: Galleria Nazionale, Museo Archeologico Nazionale and Teatro Farnese.
