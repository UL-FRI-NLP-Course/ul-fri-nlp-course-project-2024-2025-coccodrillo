Piazza Garibaldi | Parma, Italy |  On the site of the ancient Roman forum, Piazza Garibaldi is Parma's cobbled hub bisected by the city's main eastâ€“west artery, Via Mazzini, and its continuation, Strada della Repubblica. On the square's north side, the facade of the 17th-century Palazzo del Governatore, these days municipal offices, sports a giant sundial, added in 1829.
