Domus del Chirurgo | Rimini, Italy |  Occupying a large square in the centre of Rimini, these excavated remains of three Roman homes (the most prominent being the dwelling of a prosperous surgeon) hold a number of fine floor mosaics in various stages of decay. A wealth of surgical instruments recovered from the ruins are housed in the adjacent Museo della Citt√†.
