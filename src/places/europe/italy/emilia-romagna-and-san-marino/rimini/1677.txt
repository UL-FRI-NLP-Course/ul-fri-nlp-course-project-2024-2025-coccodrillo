Palazzo del Municipio | Rimini, Italy |  The city's finest palazzi hug the attractive Piazza Cavour. On its northern flank, Palazzo del Municipio, built in 1562 and reconstructed after being razed during WWII, abuts the imposing 14th-century Gothic Palazzo del Podest√†; neither are open to the public.
