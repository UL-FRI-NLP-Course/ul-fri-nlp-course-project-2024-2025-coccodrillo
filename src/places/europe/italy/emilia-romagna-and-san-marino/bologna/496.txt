Collezioni Comunali d'Arte | Bologna, Italy |  On the 2nd floor of Palazzo Comunale you'll find the art gallery Collezioni Comunali d'Arte with its interesting collection of 13th- to 19th-century paintings, sculpture and furniture. Don't miss the scale model of Medieval Bologna in Room 3, with hundreds of offensive/defensive towers, similar to today's Torre degli Asinelli, jutting above rooftops all over the city.
