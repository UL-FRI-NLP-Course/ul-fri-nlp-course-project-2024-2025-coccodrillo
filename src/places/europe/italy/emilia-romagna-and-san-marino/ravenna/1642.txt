Museo d'Arte della Citt√† di Ravenna | Ravenna, Italy |  Arranged in a converted 15th-century monastery abutting a public garden, Ravenna's permanent art collection is backed up by regular temporary expos. The ground floor features some rather fetching modern mosaics, first brought together in the 1950s, including one (Le Coq Bleu) based on a design by Marc Chagall.
