Domus dei Tappeti di Pietra | Ravenna, Italy |  Not nearly as impressive as the Unesco site mosaics, but still worth a look for serious aficionados, these 6th-century floor mosaics from a 14-room late-Roman palace were only unearthed in 1993. Restored but incomplete, they show considerable artistic merit, and are decorated with geometric and floral designs.
