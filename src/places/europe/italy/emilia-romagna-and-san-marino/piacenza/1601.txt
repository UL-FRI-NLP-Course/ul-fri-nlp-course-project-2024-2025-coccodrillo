Piazza dei Cavalli | Piacenza, Italy |  Dominated by Palazzo Gotico, the impressive 13th-century town hall, Piacenza's main square is named after its two baroque equestrian statues, cast by the Tuscan sculptor Francesco Mochi between 1612 and 1625. Depicted here are the Farnese dukes Alessandro and Ranuccio, gallantly seated astride martial bronze horses.
