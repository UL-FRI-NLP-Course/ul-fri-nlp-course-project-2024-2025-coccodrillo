Cathedral | Calabria, Italy |  Gerace has Calabria's largest Romanesque cathedral. Dating from 1045, its three aisles are divided by columns salvaged from classical villas and temples in the area; later alterations have not robbed it of its majesty. The interior is wonderfully austere and admission includes entry to the attached Cathedral Treasury museum with a glittering array of tapestries and ecclesiastical riches.
