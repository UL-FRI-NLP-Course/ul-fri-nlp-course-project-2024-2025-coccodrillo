Castello Ruffo | Calabria, Italy |  An imposing fortress surmounting the headland commanding Scilla, this castle has at times been a lighthouse and a monastery. It houses a luntre, the original boat used for swordfishing, and on which the modern-day passarelle (a special swordfish-hunting boat equipped with a 30m-high metal tower) is based.
