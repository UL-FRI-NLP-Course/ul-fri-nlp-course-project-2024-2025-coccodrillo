Piazza del Duomo | Trento, Trentino & South Tyrol |  Trento's heart is this busy yet intimate piazza, dominated, of course, by the duomo, but also host to the Fontana del Nettuno, a flashy late-baroque fountain rather whimsically dedicated to Neptune. Intricate, allegorical frescoes decorate the 16th-century facades of the Case Cazuffi-Rella, two private Renaissance houses on the piazza's northern side.
