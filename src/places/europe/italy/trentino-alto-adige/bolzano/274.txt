Museo Archeologico dell'Alto Adige | Bolzano (Bozen), Trentino & South Tyrol |  The star of the Museo Archeologico dell’Alto Adige is Ötzi, the Iceman, with almost the entire museum being given over to the Copper Age mummy. Kept in a temperature-controlled 'igloo' room, he can be viewed through a small window (peer closely enough and you can make out faintly visible tattoos on his legs). Ötzi's clothing – a wonderful get-up of patchwork leggings, rush-matting cloak and fur cap – and other belongings are also displayed.
Various exhibitions explore Ötzi's discovery, the world he lived in and his untimely death.
