Schloss Tirol Bird Care Centre | Merano (Meran), Trentino & South Tyrol |  Just below Schloss Tirol's entrance, this wildlife rescue centre rehabilitates injured birds of prey. There is a collection of eagles, vultures, hawks, owls and buzzards to see, but the real attraction is the twice-daily, 40-minute flight demonstration, spectacularly sited with the valley below.
The local owls are particularly beautiful, with feathers that mimic forest timber.
