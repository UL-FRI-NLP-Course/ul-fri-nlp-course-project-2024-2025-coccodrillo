Chiesa di Santa Maria Nuova | Viterbo, Lazio |  This 11th-century Romanesque church, the oldest in Viterbo, was restored to its original form after sustaining bomb damage in WWII. A series of 13th- to 16th-century frescoes line the solemn, grey interior, while outside you can see a stone pulpit where St Thomas Aquinas preached in 1266. Also of note is the church's cloister, the so-called Chiostro Longobardo.
