Museo Territoriale del Lago di Bolsena | Lazio, Italy |  Housed in Bolsena's 13th-century Rocca Monaldeschi at the top of the steeply stacked historic centre, this museum has a small collection of locally unearthed archaeological artefacts and a tiny aquarium.But as impressive as the exhibits are the sweeping lake views from the castle's battlements. Admission to these is included in the museum ticket price, or you can access them directly for â‚¬2.
