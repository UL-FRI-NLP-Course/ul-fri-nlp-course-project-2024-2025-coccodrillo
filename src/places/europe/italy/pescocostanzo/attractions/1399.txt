Palazzo Fanzago | Abruzzo, Italy |  The Palazzo Fanzago was designed by the great baroque architect Cosimo Fanzago in 1624. Look out for the carved wooden dragons under the roof and the ornate baroque window niches facing the square (they're actually fake windows). Inside, the gratis Museo del Merletto a Tombolo displays examples of Pescocostanzo's rich artisan heritage with an emphasis on bobbin lace-making.
