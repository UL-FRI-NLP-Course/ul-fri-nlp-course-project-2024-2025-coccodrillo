Collegiata di Santa Maria del Colle | Abruzzo, Italy |  Rebuilt in the decades following a 1456 earthquake, the atmospheric Collegiata di Santa Maria del Colle combines a superb Romanesque portal with a lavish baroque interior complete with gilded frescoed ceiling. A grand staircase leads up from the street to the main doors.
The church is usually open in daylight hours, but beware, timetables can be fickle in rural Abruzzo.
