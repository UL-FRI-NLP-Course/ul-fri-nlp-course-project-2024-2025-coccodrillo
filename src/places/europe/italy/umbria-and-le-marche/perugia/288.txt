Chiesa di San Michele Arcangelo | Perugia, Umbria |  Also known as the Chiesa or Tempio di Sant'Angelo, this 5th-century Romanesque church is one of the oldest in Italy (and the most appealing in Perugia). It was first built over an earlier Roman temple – hence the circular form and recycled columns in the interior – but it has since been modified and the main portal dates from a 14th-century Gothic makeover.
Before embarking on the long walk back into town, reward yourself with time out on the lovely lawn outside.
