Cattedrale e Abbazia di San Pietro | Perugia, Umbria |  South of the town centre, past the Porta di San Pietro, is this atmospheric 10th-century basilica complex. The basilica, overlooked by a landmark bell tower, is stunning inside, with opulent displays of gilt and marble and some wonderful works of art, including a Piet√† (a painting of the dead Christ supported by the Madonna) by Perugino.
To clear your head afterwards, take a stroll or picnic in the serene Orto Medievale gardens, behind the basilica.
