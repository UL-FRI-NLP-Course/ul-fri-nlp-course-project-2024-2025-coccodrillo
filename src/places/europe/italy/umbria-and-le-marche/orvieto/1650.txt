Chiesa di Sant'Andrea | Orvieto, Umbria |  This 12th-century church, with its curious decagonal bell tower, presides over Piazza della Repubblica, once Orvieto's Roman forum and now a cafe-lined square in the medieval centre. Call ahead for an archaeologist-led tour of ancient Etruscan and Roman buildings and an early Christian church in the basement (â‚¬5).
