Gola dell'Infernaccio | Le Marche, Italy |  There's fine walking to be had in the spectacular mountain country near the village of Montefortino. A stunning, and relatively accessible route, leads through the Gola dell'Infernaccio (Gorge of Hell), a thrilling canyon wedged between walls of vertiginous rock face. Silence hangs over the rugged peaks and ancient woodland, broken only by birdsong and the sound of the fast-flowing River Tenna.
The Gola is signposted off the SP83 north of Montefortino â€“ follow the road, which becomes unsurfaced as it approaches a small parking area at the trailhead.
