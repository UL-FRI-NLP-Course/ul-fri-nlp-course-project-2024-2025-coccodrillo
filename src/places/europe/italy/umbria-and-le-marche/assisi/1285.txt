Foro Romano | Assisi, Umbria |  In among the churches and medieval streets you can still find a few traces of Assisi's Roman past. Extending beneath Piazza del Commune are the remains of the town's ancient forum, discovered during archaeological digs in the 19th century. Above ground, the piazza is dominated by the columned facade of the 1st-century BC Tempio di Minerva, now hiding a rather uninspiring 16th-century church.
