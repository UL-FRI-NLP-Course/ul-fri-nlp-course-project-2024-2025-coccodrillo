La Cattedrale di Santa Maria Annunziata | Todi, Umbria |  Todi's 12th-century Duomo sits at the head of Piazza del Popolo on the site of an earlier Roman temple. Its solemn square facade sports a magnificent central rose window, actually added in the 16th century, and an intricately decorated main portal. Inside, look out for The Last Judgment, a fresco by Ferra√π Fenzoni (aka Il Faenzone) inspired by Michelangelo's more celebrated Sistine Chapel version.
