Museo Pinacoteca Comunale | Todi, Umbria |  Housed in the striking 13th-century Palazzo del Capitano, this museum features an elegant triple window. It holds a fine, if hardly overwhelming, collection of mainly 17th-century paintings, and a rather more successful archaeological section with displays of old coins and ceramics.
