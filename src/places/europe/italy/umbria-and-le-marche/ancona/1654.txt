Arco Clementino | Ancona, Italy |  Built by Luigi Vanvitelli in 1738, this portside arch takes its name from Pope Clement XII who boosted Ancona's fortunes by declaring the city a free port. Its imposing form was originally designed to impress disembarking mariners and serve as a monumental gateway to the Papal States, of which Le Marche was a part.
