Arco di Traiano | Ancona, Italy |  At the northern end of the port, the Arco di Traiano is one of Ancona's treasured ancient relics. Built between AD 110 and 116 by a Syrian architect known as Apollodorus of Damascus, it was crafted out of Turkish marble to honour the Roman Emperor Trajan who had personally financed a major expansion of the port.
