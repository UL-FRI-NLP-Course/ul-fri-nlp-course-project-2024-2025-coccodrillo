Belvedere Cappuccini | Umbria, Italy |  Head to this viewing balcony at the top of town for a living postcard view across the bucolic countryside below â€“ on a clear day you can make out Assisi (it's off to the right, just under the horizon).
Near to the belvedere is the Chiesa di San Severino (an active Capuchin monastery that's closed to the public) and an ancient Roman arch (Arco Romano), dating to the pre-Augustine period.
