Antiquarium & Teatro Romano | Umbria, Italy |  To the southwest of the historic centre lies a partially preserved 1st-century Roman theatre. Artefacts unearthed at the site and around Gubbio are displayed in a modest on-site museum, alongside several mosaics from the Domus of Scylla, the Roman villa over which the museum stands.
