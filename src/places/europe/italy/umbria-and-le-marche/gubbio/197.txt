Piazza Grande | Umbria, Italy |  This panoramic piazza, the result of an ambitious 14th-century urban development plan, is medieval Gubbio's showpiece square. Commanding huge valley views, it's book-ended by two of the town's signature buildings: Palazzo dei Consoli on its western flank and, on the eastern side, Palazzo del Podest√†.
