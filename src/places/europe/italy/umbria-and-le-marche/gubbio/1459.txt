Fontana dei Matti | Umbria, Italy |  In front of the 14th-century Palazzo del Bargello, the city's medieval police station and prison, the Fontana dei Matti (Fountain of the Lunatics) owes its name to a belief that you'll go mad if you run around it three times. On summer weekends, the number of visitors trying this does indeed raise questions about the collective sanity!
