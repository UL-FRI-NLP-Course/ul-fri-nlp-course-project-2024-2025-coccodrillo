Casa Rossini | Le Marche, Italy |  In 1792 composer Gioachino Rossini was born in this four-storey town house on what is now the main drag through Pesaro's historic centre. The small museum is dedicated to the maestro, with prints, personal items, portraits, even a small piano, illustrating his life and famous operas, such as the 1816 bestseller, Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville).
