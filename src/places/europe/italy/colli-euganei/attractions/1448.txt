Castello di Monselice | The Veneto, Italy |  At the southern reaches of the Colli Euganei (Euganean Hills), in the pocket-sized town of Monselice, lies this remarkable medieval castle. Its oldest sections dating back to the 11th century, the complex has played numerous roles, including defensive tower and noble residence. Today it's home to the Antiquarium Longobardo and its collection of ancient, local Lombard artefacts.
