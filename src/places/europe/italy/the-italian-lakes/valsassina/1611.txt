Piani dei Resinelli | Lake Como, The Italian Lakes |  About 9km northeast of Lecco, at Ballabio Superiore, a turnoff west sees you ascend about 8km of switchbacks through wooded country to Piani dei Resinelli, just for the views. The arrival point is made up of a small settlement, highland fields and woods, backed by bare rockfaces. It is a starting point for several hiking trails.
