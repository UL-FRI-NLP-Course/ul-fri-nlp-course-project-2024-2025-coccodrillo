Santuario della Madonna del Ghisallo | Lake Como, The Italian Lakes |  This tiny 17th-century church is a major destination for cyclists, who long ago began leaving jerseys, bicycles, medals and other objects. The place's importance for two-wheeled enthusiasts was such that Pope Pius XII declared the Madonna del Ghisallo the patron of cyclists.
