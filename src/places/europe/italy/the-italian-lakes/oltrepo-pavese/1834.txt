Eremo di Sant'Alberto di Butrio | The Italian Lakes, Italy |  One of the must-see sights of the region is this 11th-century hermitage situated on wooded hillside in the Val di Nizza. Consisting of three inter-connected churches, it's decorated with fading 15th-century frescoes and is a haven of contemplative tranquility.
