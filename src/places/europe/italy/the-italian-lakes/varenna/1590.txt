Chiesa di San Giovanni Battista | Lake Como, The Italian Lakes |  Much overlooked in all the excitement about Varenna's villas are the lovely 14th-century frescoes, somewhat damaged but nevertheless full of colour, tucked inside the tiny Romanesque Chiesa di San Giovanni Battista. Unfortunately, finding it open is a bit hit and miss; ask at the tourist office.
