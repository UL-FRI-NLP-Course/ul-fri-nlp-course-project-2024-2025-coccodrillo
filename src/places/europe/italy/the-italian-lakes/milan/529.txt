Torre Pirelli | Milan, The Italian Lakes |  Construction began in 1956 on Milan’s tallest grattacielo (skyscraper). The 32-storey Pirelli Tower sits on the site of the company’s 19th-century factory, symbolically bookending Italy’s industrial heyday. The smooth tapered sides of Gio Ponti’s modernist icon form the shape of a diamond, his oft-used graphic trademark.
