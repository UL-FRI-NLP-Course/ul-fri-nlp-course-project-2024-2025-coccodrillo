Armani Silos | Milan, The Italian Lakes |  Housed in a fiercely contemporary concrete building created from a defunct grain silo, Giorgio Armani's eponymous museum showcases his love of elegant tailoring. Although there are some 600 garments and 200 accessories in the collection, most interesting, perhaps, is the floor dedicated to his highly crafted and colourful couture line. One for true fashion aficionados.
