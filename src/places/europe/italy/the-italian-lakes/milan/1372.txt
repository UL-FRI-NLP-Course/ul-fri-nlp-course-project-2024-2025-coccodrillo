Studio Museo Achille Castiglioni | Milan, The Italian Lakes |  Architect, designer and teacher Achille Castiglioni was one of Italyâ€™s most influential 20th-century thinkers. This is the studio where he worked until his death in 2002, and the hour-long tours led by his daughter vividly illuminate his playful creative process. From a mayonnaise spoon to a swinging bicycle seat, delight in the (often surprising) purpose of each object. Bookings are essential.
