Villa Reale | The Italian Lakes, Italy |  In Monza's colossal park stands this equally colossal palace. Built between 1777 and 1780 as a viceregal residence for Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, Giuseppe Piermarini's vast Villa Reale was modelled on Vienna's Sch√∂nbrunn Palace. It served as the summer home for Italian royalty, but was abandoned following the assassination of Umberto I in 1900. Years of restoration have revived its glorious 3500-sq-metre frescoed, stuccoed and gilded interior containing royal apartments, a theatre, an orangery and a chapel.
Arguably of more interest is the space given over to avant-garde temporary exhibitions. Andy Warhol was showing at last visit.There's a large modern cafe inside and acres of grand English-style gardens to explore afterwards.
