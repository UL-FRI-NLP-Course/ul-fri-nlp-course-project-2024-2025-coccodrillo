Chiesa di San Giovanni in Bragora | Venice, Italy |  This serene 15th-century brick church harmonises Gothic and Renaissance styles with remarkable ease, setting the tone for a young Antonio Vivaldi, who was baptised here. Look for Bartolomeo Vivarini’s 1478 Enthroned Madonna with St Andrew and John the Baptist, which shows the Madonna bouncing a delighted baby Jesus on her knee.
Bartolomeo’s nephew Alvise depicts Jesus in later years in his splendidly restored 1494 Saviour Blessing, in which Christ has a cloudlike beard and eyes that seem to follow you around the room.
