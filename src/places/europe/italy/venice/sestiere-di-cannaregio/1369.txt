Wilmotte Foundation | Venice, Italy |  Created by architect and designer Jean-Michel Wilmotte, this foundation aims to nurture the talent of young architects via a series of annual international competitions and exhibitions. Winning work is exhibited in this out-of-the-way gallery – itself a beautifully converted shipyard – and shown alongside fascinating architectural photography from masters such as Gio Ponti and Giorgio Massari.
