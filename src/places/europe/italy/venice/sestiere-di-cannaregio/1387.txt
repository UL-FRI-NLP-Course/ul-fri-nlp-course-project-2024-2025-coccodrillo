Chiesa di San Marcuola | Venice, Italy |  The right hand of John the Baptist was once housed in this church founded in the 9th century; however, the church burned in the 14th century, and what you see now was cobbled together (and not quite completed) in the 18th by architects Giorgio Massari and Antonio Gaspari. Inside is Tintorettoâ€™s 1547 Last Supper, with Christ and apostles ominously spotlit against a black background.
