Ponte della Costituzione | Venice, Italy |  Avant-garde Spanish architect Santiago Calatravaâ€™s 2008 bridge over the Grand Canal has been called many things: a fish tail, a glass tongue, pleasingly streamlined, displeasingly wheelchair-inaccessible and torture if you're lugging bags to and from the bus station. Some prefer the bridge by night, viewed as a ghostly streak of light reflected in the Grand Canal; others appreciate daylight, which reveals its red ribbed-steel underbelly.
