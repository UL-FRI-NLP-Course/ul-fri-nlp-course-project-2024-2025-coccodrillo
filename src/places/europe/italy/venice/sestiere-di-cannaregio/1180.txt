Schola Canton | Venice, Italy |  The Schola Canton was built c 1531, with gilded rococo interiors added in the 18th century. Though European synagogues typically avoid figurative imagery, this little one makes an exception to the rule with eight charming landscapes inspired by biblical parables. From the square, look for the small wooden extension and leaning cupola in the corner behind the entrance to the Museo Ebraico. Entry is by guided tour via the museum.
