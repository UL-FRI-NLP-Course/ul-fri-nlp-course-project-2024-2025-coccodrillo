Campo dei Mori | Venice, Italy |  Sior Rioba, a gent in an outsized turban, has been hanging out at the corner of Campo dei Mori since the Middle Ages. The square's name is a misnomer, as Rioba and his three buddies are believed to represent the Greek Mastelli family, 12th-century merchants from Morea. The Mastelli brothers became notorious for their eager participation in Doge Dandoloâ€™s sacking of Constantinople and, according to legend, Mary Magdalene herself turned them into stone.
