Schola Spagnola | Venice, Italy |  The Ghetto's largest synagogue was founded by Portuguese and Spanish refugees around 1580. Its current grand incarnation, dating from the 17th century, shows just how Venetian the community had become, incorporating architectural flourishes such as repeating geometric details, high-arched windows, and exuberant marble and carved-wood baroque interiors. Entry is by guided tour via Museo Ebraico.
