Schola Italiana | Venice, Italy |  The wooden cupola of the 1575 Italian Synagogue protrudes above private apartments at the centre of the Ghetto's main square. The Italians were the poorest in the Ghetto, but their synagogue is starkly beautiful, with elegantly carved woodwork. Entry by guided tour via Museo Ebraico.
