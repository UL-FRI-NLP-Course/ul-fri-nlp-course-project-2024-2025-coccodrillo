Chiesa di San Simeon Piccolo | San Polo & Santa Croce, Venice |  Designed by Giovanni Antonio Scalfarotto and completed in 1738, this domed neoclassical building was one of the last churches to be built in Venice. It's now used for the celebration of the Tridentine (traditional Latin) Mass. For a thoroughly creepy experience, pay â‚¬2 for a candle to explore the darkened cross-shaped crypt below, although you might want to stuff your pockets with garlic just in case.
