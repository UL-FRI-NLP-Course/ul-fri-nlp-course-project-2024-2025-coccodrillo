Chiesa di San Giovanni Elemosinario | San Polo & Santa Croce, Venice |  Hunkering modestly behind T-shirt kiosks is this soaring brick church, built by Scarpagnino after a disastrous fire in 1514 destroyed much of the Rialto area. Cross the threshold to witness flashes of Renaissance genius: Titian's tender St John the Almsgiver (1545) altarpiece and gloriously restored dome frescoes of frolicking angels by Pordenone.
