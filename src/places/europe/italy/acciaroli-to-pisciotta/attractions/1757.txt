Spiaggia Grande di Acciaroli | Cilento Coast, Italy |  Another Cilento stunner, Acciaroli’s main beach has sand, space, a Blue Flag rating and easy access to the historic town at its southern end. Water and sand are kept ruthlessly clean. If you couldn't hack the Amalfi’s rocky, crowded ‘beaches’, this will be a gulp of fresh air.
