Piazzale Papa Innocenzo IV | Manarola, Italy |  This small piazza is dominated by a bell tower that was once used as a defensive lookout. Opposite, the Chiesa di San Lorenzo dates from 1338 and houses a 15th-century polyptych. If you're geared up for a steep walk, from nearby Via Rollandi you can follow a path that leads through vineyards to the top of the mountain.
Reach the piazzale by following Via Discovolo uphill. It's about a 10-minute walk from the waterfront.
