Piazza de Ferrari | Genoa, Italy |  Genoa's fountain-embellished main piazza is ringed by magnificent buildings that include the art nouveau Palazzo della Borsa, which was once the country's stock exchange, and the hybrid neoclassical-modernist Teatro Carlo Felice, bombed in WWII and not fully rebuilt until 1991.
