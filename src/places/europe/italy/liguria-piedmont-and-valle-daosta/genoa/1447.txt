Biosfera | Genoa, Italy |  A giant glass ball housing a humid mini-ecosystem with tropical plants, butterflies and birds, the Biosphere is an innovative addition to the port, although its assorted greenery probably won't delay you more than 15 minutes. The ambient temperature inside is controlled by computers. It was designed by Renzo Piano in 2001, and is known locally as la bolla (the bubble).
