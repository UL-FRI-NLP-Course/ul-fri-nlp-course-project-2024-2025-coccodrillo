Chiesa del Ges√π | Genoa, Italy |  Hidden behind Piazza de Ferrari, this former Jesuit church dating from 1597 has an intricate and lavish interior. The wonderfully frescoed walls and ceiling are anchored by two works by the great Dutch artist Rubens. Circoncisione (Circumcision) hangs over the main altar, and Miracolo di San Ignazio is displayed in a side chapel.
