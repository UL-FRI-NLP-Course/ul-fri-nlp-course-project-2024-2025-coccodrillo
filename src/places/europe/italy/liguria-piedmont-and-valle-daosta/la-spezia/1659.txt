Porto Mirabello | La Spezia, Italy |  It's worth taking a stroll down to the waterfront and across the scenic Ponte Thaon di Revel for a look at La Spezia's modern, expansive port. You'll see some impressive yachts and pretty views of city, sea and mountainous horizon. It's particularly impressive around sunset.
