Museo Tecnico Navale della Spezia | La Spezia, Italy |  Maritime lovers shouldn't miss the world's oldest naval museum, which is reached via a narrow bridge a few blocks southwest of Parco Salvador Allende. The halls contain all manner of naval curiosities, including small models of sailing vessels from around the globe, otherworldly diving suits and a special area dedicated to Marconi's wireless invention. Upstairs, the Sala delle Polene is a hauntingly beautiful room with 28 figureheads that once adorned large sailing ships. The oldest, a sword- and shield-wielding Minerva, dates from 1738.
Oddities include several WWII-era barchini esplosivi, torpedo-like vessels guided towards enemy ships by one or two sailors who were likely to perish during the attack.
