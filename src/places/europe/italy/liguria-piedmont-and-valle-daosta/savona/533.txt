Cappella Sistina | Savona, Italy |  Dating from the 1480s, Savona's Sistine Chapel (like the one in Rome) was created by Pope Sixtus IV. Though far less famous than its Roman counterpoint, this site – a funerary chapel for Sixtus' deceased parents – is a striking work of art. It's well worth seeing if you happen to be around the one day a week it's open.
