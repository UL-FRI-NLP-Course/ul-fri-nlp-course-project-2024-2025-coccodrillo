La Pigna | San Remo, Italy |  San Remo's little-visited old town is a labyrinth of quiet, twisting lanes set on a hilltop just above the bustling centre. Get there by taking Via Santo Stefano uphill and losing yourself among the cobblestone paths. If you keep ascending, you'll eventually reach the Giardina Regina Elena, a pine-shaded terrace (with a playground) that has fine views over town.
