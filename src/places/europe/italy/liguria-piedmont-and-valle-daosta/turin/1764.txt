Giardino Reale | Turin, Italy |  These royal gardens, freely accessed via the Palazzo Reale, make a tranquil setting for a bit of down time in the city centre. Flower-lined pathways, granite sculptures, trickling fountains and forested areas inspire idyllic strolls. You can also grab a chair and watch the day unfold.
