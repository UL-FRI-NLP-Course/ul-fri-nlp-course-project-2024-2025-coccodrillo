Centro Culturale San Giuseppe | Alba, Italy |  A converted church turned cultural centre, this is a lovely place to catch a choral or chamber music performance, or undertake a bracing hike up 134 steps to the 36m belltower (â‚¬1). In the basement, 2nd-century archaeological remains from the vanquished Roman Empire have been uncovered, and they also host temporary art exhibitions here.
