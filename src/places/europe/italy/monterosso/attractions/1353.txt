Convento dei Cappuccini | Monterosso, Italy |  Monterosso's most interesting church and convent complex is set on the hill that divides the old town from the newer Fegina quarter. The striped church, the Chiesa di San Francesco, dates from 1623 and has a painting attributed to Van Dyck (Crocifissione) to the left of the altar. The convent welcomes casual visitors but also has a program of spiritual retreats and workshops.
