Spiaggia San Michele | Le Marche, Italy |  This glorious long beach, sandwiched between crystalline cobalt waters and low white cliffs coated in Mediterranean macchia (shrubland), is a favourite with surfers when the maestrale wind whips in. Like it's neighbour, the Spiaggia Urbani, it's within walking distance of Sirolo.
