Cappella Colleoni | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  The Cappella Colleoni, attached to the north side of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, was built between 1472 and 1476 as a magnificent mausoleum-cum-chapel for the Bergamese mercenary commander Bartolomeo Colleoni (c 1400–75), who led Venice's armies in campaigns across northern Italy. He lies buried inside in a magnificent tomb.
Venetian rococo master Giambattista Tiepolo (1696–1770) did some of the frescoes below the central dome.
