Baptistry | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  This octagonal baptistry was built in 1340 but moved to its present spot and was given a few neo-Gothic flourishes in 1898. Inside, you'll find bas-reliefs depicting key episodes from Jesus' life (created by the 14th-century sculptor) Giovanni da Campione. On the exterior dome, eight statues represent each of the Christian virtues.
