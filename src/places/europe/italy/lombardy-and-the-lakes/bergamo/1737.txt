Rocca | Bergamo, The Italian Lakes |  This impressive fortress is dominated by a round tower that dates from Bergamo's days as a Venetian outpost. La Rocca houses part of the city's history museum, and is surrounded by a park with lovely views over lower Bergamo. The views are even better from the castle's tower.
