Piazza del Comune | Cremona, The Italian Lakes |  This beautiful, pedestrian-only piazza is considered one of the best-preserved medieval squares in all Italy. To maintain divisions between Church and state, buildings linked to the Church were erected on the eastern side and those linked to secular affairs were constructed on the west.
