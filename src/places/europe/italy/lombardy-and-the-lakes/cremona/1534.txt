Palazzo Comunale | Cremona, The Italian Lakes |  The Palazzo Comunale has been home to the city's government for hundreds of years. Begun in the 13th century, its arcaded walkways and courtyards were gradually extended and embellished. On the central pillar of the main facade, look out for the marble arengario (a balcony from which decrees were made and speeches given); it was added in 1507.
