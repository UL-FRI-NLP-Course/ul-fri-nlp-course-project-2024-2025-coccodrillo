Piazza del Foro | Brescia, The Italian Lakes |  Back in the first century AD, the Piazza del Foro was the centre of civic and religious life in Brescia (Brixia). You can see a few fragments – including several Corinthian columns – from this once large square (it stretched 140m by 40m) on the east side of the piazza.
