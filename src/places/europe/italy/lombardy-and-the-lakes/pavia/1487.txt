Castello Visconteo | Pavia, The Italian Lakes |  Looming over the old town is the red-brick Castello Visconteo, built in 1360 for Galeazzo II Visconti. Inside the forbidding ramparts is an enormous walled garden, where art exhibits and wine tastings are held in spring and summer. The castle is also home to Musei Civici, which houses interesting, if poorly curated, archaeological, ethnographic and art collections.
