Orto Botanico | Pavia, The Italian Lakes |  Wander around the historic botanical garden when the Universit√† degli Studi di Pavia is open. It's situated on an area once covered by the convent of Sant'Epifanio, and the outlines of the cloister are still visible. Under the Austrians, it was the site of avant-garde botanical experimentation, but it now provides shady respite from the city.
