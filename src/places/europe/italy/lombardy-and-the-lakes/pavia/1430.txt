Basilica di San Michele | Pavia, The Italian Lakes |  Pavia's most important church isn't the Duomo, but the beautiful Romanesque San Michele, where medieval Lombard kings came to receive their iron crown and where Barbarossa was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1155. Don't miss the presbytery where you'll find fragments of mosaic floor depicting the Labours of the Months, or the atmospheric crypt, with its beautifully decorated capitals.
