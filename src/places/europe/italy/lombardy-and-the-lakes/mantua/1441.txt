Palazzo del Podest√† | Mantua, The Italian Lakes |  This huge, 13th-century palace sits between Piazza delle Erbe and Piazza Broletto and was commissioned by Duke Ludovico Gonzaga. For centuries it served as the town hall, but is currently under renovation after suffering damage in the 2012 Emilia earthquake. Containing 200 rooms spread over eight floors, the work involved is huge, with 2021 touted as the earliest completion date.
