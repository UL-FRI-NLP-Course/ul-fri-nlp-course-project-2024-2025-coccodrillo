Museo Carnico delle Arti e Tradizioni Popolari | Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy |  This four-storey museum has a rich display of artisanal furniture and folkloric objects dating from the 14th to the early 19th century. They're atmospherically displayed in 30 rooms in 17th-century Palazzo Campeis, making it one of the most significant ethnographic museums on mountain life in Europe. The carved cabinetry, wrought iron and weird and wonderful mask collection are quite outstanding.
