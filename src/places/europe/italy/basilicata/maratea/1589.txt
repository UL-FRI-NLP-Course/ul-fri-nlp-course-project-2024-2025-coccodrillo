Maratea Superiore | Basilicata, Italy |  The ruins of the original settlement of Maratea, supposedly founded by the Greeks, are situated at a higher elevation than the current village on a rocky escarpment just below the Christ the Redeemer statue. Abandoned houses with trees growing in their midst, some thought to be over 1000 years old, have long been given over to nature.
