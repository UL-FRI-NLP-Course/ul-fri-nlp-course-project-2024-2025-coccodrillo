Museo Archeologico Nazionale | Basilicata, Italy |  This small but important museum is a real throwback to the days when precious artefacts of the past sat soberly behind glass, accompanied only by simple interpretative cards. Mirrors, ceramics, votive offerings and other relics of the area's Greek and Roman past are laid out for quiet contemplation. Signage is in Italian.
