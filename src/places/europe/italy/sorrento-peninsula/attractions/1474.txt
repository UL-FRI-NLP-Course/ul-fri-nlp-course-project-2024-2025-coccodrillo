Baia di Ieranto | Sorrento Peninsula, Italy |  A spectacular beach at the tip of the Punta Penna peninsula south of Sorrento, Ieranto is reached via a walking path that starts in the village of Nerano. The walk takes about 45 minutes one-way and there are several steep downhill sections to negotiate. Wear good shoes. The pebbly beach is sheltered by headlands and perfect for swimming, but can get crowded in summer.
