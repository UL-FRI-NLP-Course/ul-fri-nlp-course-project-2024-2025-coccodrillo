Grotta Azzurra | Cilento Coast, Italy |  Although it doesn’t have the hype of its Capri counterpart, Palinuro’s Grotta Azzurra is similarly spectacular, with a brilliant play of light and hue. It owes its name to the extraordinary effect created by the sunlight that filters inside from an underground passage lying at a depth of about 8m. Da Alessandro runs trips to this and other caves from €15.
The best time to visit is the afternoon, due to the position of the sun.
