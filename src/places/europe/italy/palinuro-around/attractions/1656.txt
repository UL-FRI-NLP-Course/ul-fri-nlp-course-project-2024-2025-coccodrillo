Spiaggia Palinuro | Cilento Coast, Italy |  The town’s main beach stretches for around 4km north of the centre. There is another more sheltered curve of sand abutting Palinuro’s postcard-pretty harbour in the south, replete with colourful fishing boats, several bars and a rocky headland standing sentinel. You can hire kayaks and arrange boat trips here.
