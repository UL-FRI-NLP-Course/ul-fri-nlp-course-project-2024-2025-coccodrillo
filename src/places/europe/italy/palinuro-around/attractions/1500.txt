Spiaggia Marinella | Cilento Coast, Italy |  For a slightly quieter scene than you might find in Palinuro, head southeast of town to Spiaggia Marinella, surrounded by lush banks of greenery. The beach is approached via steep steps, and thereâ€™s a small car park at the top. The shoreline here is protected by two breakwaters and is excellent for swimming and pedal-boating (rentals available in the summer).
