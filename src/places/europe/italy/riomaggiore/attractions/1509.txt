Fossola Beach | Riomaggiore, Italy |  This small pebbly beach is immediately southeast of Riomaggiore marina. Take the short trail that leads just past the harbour to get here. The shore is rugged and delightfully secluded from the village (though it gets packed in the summer); it's also remarkably photogenic with the waters framed by the steep hillsides. Swimmers should be wary of currents here.
