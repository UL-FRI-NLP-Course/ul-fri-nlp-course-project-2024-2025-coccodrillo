Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio | Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy |  Constructed from 1654 to 1724, the onion-shaped domes of this high-baroque Jesuit church watch over Gorizia's old town square. The interior is richly decorated with marble altars, inlaid wooden furniture dating to the 17th century and a frescoed pulpit glorifying St Ignatius executed by Christoph Tausch, the author of the stunning St Anne's church in Vienna.
