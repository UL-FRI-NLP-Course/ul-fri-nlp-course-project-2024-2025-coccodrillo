Riserva Naturale Regionale Foce dell'Isonzo | Grado, Italy |  The final stretch of the Isonzo river's journey into the Adriatic flows through this 23.5-sq-km nature reserve where visitors can birdwatch, horse ride or walk around salt marshes and mudflats. There's also a cycle path that runs along the shoreline all the way back to Grado, via the Valle Cavanata. There's a small cafe at the visitor centre.
