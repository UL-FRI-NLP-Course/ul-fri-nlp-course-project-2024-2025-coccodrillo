Statue of James Joyce | Trieste, Italy |  James Joyce's presence in the city is palpable, but if you're not feeling it, this bronze statue will help. He's often surrounded by Irish visitors and his scenic home on the Grand Canal makes for great selfies. Don't miss the companion statue of his great friend and fellow writer, Italo Svevo.
