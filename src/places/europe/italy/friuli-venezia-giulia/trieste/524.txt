Synagogue | Trieste, Italy |  This imposing and richly decorated neoclassical synagogue, built in 1912, is testament to Trieste's once significant Jewish community. Heavily damaged during WWII, it has been meticulously restored and remains one of the most important, and profoundly beautiful, synagogues in Italy. It's not necessary to book the tours; just arrive five minutes before they start.
