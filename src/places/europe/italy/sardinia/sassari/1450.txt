Fontana di Rosello | Sassari, Sardinia |  Sassari's most famous fountain sits in a sunken area by Piazza Mercato, a busy traffic junction just outside the city walls. A monumental marble box ringed by four statues and eight lion-head spouts, and topped by two fine marble arches, it was for a long time the focus of city life. Guided tours are available through the tourist office.
