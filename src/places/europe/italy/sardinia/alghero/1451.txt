Giardini Pubblici | Alghero, Sardinia |  At some point you'll probably find yourself passing by Alghero's public gardens. The verdant park, which effectively separates the medieval centre from the modern new town, was created in the 19th century when the landward stretches of the city's defensive walls were torn down. Today it's frequented by everyone from tourists and street sellers to teenagers and chatting locals.
