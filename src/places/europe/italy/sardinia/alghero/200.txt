Campanile | Alghero, Sardinia |  Rising above the historic centre, the Cattedrale di Santa Maria's 16th-century campanile is one of Alghero's signature landmarks. The tower, accessible through a Gothic doorway on Via Principe Umberto, is a fine example of Catalan Gothic architecture with its elegant octagonal structure and short pyramid-shaped spire. Climb to the top for amazing views.
