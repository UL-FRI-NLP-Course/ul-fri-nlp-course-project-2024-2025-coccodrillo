Roccia dell’Orso | Palau, Sardinia |  This weather-beaten granite sculpture sits on a high point 6km east of Palau. The Roccia dell’Orso (Bear Rock) looks considerably less bearlike up close, resembling more – dare we say it? – a dragon. Analogies aside, the granite formations are extraordinary, as are the far-reaching views of the coast from up here. From the parking lot, it's a climb of 10 to 15 minutes.
