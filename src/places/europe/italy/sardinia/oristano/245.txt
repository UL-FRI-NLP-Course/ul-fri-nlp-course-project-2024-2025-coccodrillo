Piazza Eleonora d’Arborea | Oristano, Sardinia |  Oristano’s elegant outdoor salon sits at the southern end of pedestrianised Corso Umberto I. An impressive, rectangular space, it comes to life on summer evenings when townsfolk congregate and children blast footballs against the glowing palazzi. The city’s central square since the 19th century, it’s flanked by grand buildings, including the neoclassical Municipio. In the centre stands an ornate 19th-century statue of Eleonora, raising a finger as if about to launch into a political speech.
Bargain hunters should drop by on the first Saturday of the month when the piazza hosts an antiques market.
