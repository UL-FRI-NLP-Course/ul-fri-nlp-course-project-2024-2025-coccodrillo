Statue of Carlo Felice | Cagliari, Sardinia |  Erected in Piazza Yenne in 1860, this melodramatic statue shows Carlo Felice, Sardinia's king from 1821 to his death in 1831, posing as an ancient Roman. It marks the starting point of the SS131, Sardinia's main northâ€“south artery, the project for which he is best remembered.
