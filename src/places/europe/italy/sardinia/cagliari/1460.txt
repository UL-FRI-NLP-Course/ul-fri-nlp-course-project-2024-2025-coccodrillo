Villa di Tigellio | Cagliari, Sardinia |  These remains of three Roman houses date to the 1st century BC. Legend has it that Tigellio Ermogene – a famous Sardinian poet and musician, and a close a friend of Julius Caesar – lived here. Today the ruins are pretty overgrown and surrounded by houses, so you’ll need to use your imagination to picture the magnificent mosaics, columns and baths that once stood here.
