Piazzetta | Porto Cervo, Sardinia |  The place to be seen is the Piazzetta, a small square at the centre of a web of discreet shopping alleys. From the piazza, stairs lead to the Sottopiazza and La Passeggiata, both lined with fancy boutiques – Cartier, Gucci, Versace, Prada, Valentino, Moschino – you name it, they’re all here.
