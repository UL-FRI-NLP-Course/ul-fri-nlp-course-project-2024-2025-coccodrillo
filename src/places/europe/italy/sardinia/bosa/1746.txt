Chiesa di Sant’Antonio Abate | Bosa, Sardinia |  A short walk from Ponte Vecchio on the southern side of the river is the little Chiesa di Sant’Antonio Abate. Featuring a 16th-century Gothic facade in red trachyte stone, it’s only open during the festival dedicated to St Antonio Abate on 16 and 17 January and again during Carnevale.
