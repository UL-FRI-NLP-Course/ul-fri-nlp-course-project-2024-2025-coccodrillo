Arco d'Augusto | Piedmont, Italy |  The pristine and impressive triumphal Arch of Augustus, dating to 9BC, sits just outside the centre of town. It marks the transition of power between the Celtic-Ligurian Marcus Julius Cottius and Roman Emperor Augustus, who in fact inaugurated it on his way home from Gaul. Its beautifully peaceful position makes it all the more enthralling, plus you'll often get it all to yourself.
