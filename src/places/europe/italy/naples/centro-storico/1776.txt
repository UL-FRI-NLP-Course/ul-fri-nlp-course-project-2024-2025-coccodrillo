Guglia dell'Immacolata | Naples, Italy |  Soaring high above beautiful Piazza del Ges√π Nuovo is Giuseppe Genuino's lavish Guglia dell'Immacolata, an obelisk built between 1747 and 1750. On 8 December, the feast of the Immacolata, a fireman scrambles to the top to place a wreath of flowers on the statue of the Virgin Mary.
