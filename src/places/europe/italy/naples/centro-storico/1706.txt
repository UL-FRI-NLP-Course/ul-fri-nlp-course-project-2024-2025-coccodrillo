Mercato Sant'Antonio Abate | Naples, Italy |  Running along ramshackle Via Sant’Antonio Abate, O’ Buvero is a hyperactive, rough-and-ready neighbourhood market peddling everything from fresh fruit and vegetables, to seafood, local cheeses and salumi (charcuterie). It's also an evocative spot to experience Napoli at its most intense.
