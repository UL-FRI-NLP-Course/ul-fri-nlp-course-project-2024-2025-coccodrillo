Complesso San Pietro Martire | Naples, Italy |  This former Dominican monastery is the current seat of the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II. Although the monastery has its roots in the late 13th century, its cloister dates from 1557. The latter is a simple, elegant affair, with piperno-stone arches gracing both its ground-floor portico and upper-floor loggia. A popular hangout for students, the cloister also offers a view of the colourful majolica dome crowning the monastery's church.
