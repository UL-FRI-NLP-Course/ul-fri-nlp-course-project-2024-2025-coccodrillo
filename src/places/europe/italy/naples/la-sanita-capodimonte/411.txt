Celanapoli | Naples, Italy |  Naples' oldest necropolis, these ancient-Greek aristocratic tombs were hewn into the city’s buttery tufa rock around the 4th century BC. Hidden just a few metres below a weathered palazzo (mansion), two burial chambers have been partially excavated, revealing priceless Hellenistic funerary decorations: precious frescoes and the ochre-draped legs of two figures of a high-relief sculpture.
