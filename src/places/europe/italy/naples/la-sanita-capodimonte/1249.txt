Real Bosco di Capodimonte | Naples, Italy |  Parco di Capodimonte makes for a blissful chill, with lakes, a wood and various 18th-century buildings, including former royal porcelain workshop Palazzo Porcellane. Designed by Ferdinando Sanfelice in 1742 as a royal hunting reserve, the parkâ€™s main attraction, however, is the grandiose Palazzo Reale di Capodimonte. The palace website includes a map of the park, complete with a series of themed walks.
