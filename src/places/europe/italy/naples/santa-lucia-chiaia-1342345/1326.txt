Villa Maria | Naples, Italy |  Fronted by sinuous palms, colourful Villa Maria is an outstanding example of Italian art nouveau architecture. Dating from 1901, the building was commissioned by French entrepreneur Giulio Huraut and designed by Veneto architect Angelo Trevisan as the Grand Eden Hotel, a luxury slumber pad for wealthy foreign travellers. The villa would subsequently house a Swiss school before its conversion to private apartments.
