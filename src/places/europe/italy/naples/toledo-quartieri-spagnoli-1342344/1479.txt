Galleria Umberto I | Naples, Italy |  Recalling Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, Naples' most famous 19th-century arcade is a breathtaking pairing of richly adorned neo-Renaissance fronts and a delicate glass ceiling capped by a lofty 56m dome. Complete with a sumptuous marble floor, the galleria is at its most spectacular at night, when it becomes a surreal setting for impromptu soccer games.
