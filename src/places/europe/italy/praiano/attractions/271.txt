Marina di Praia | Praiano, Italy |  Located a couple of kilometres east of the centre, this charming beach and harbour are the reasons why most people stop off in Praiano. From the SS163 (next to Hotel Onda Verde), a steep path leads down the cliffs to a tiny inlet with a small stretch of coarse sand and very tempting water; the best water is actually off the rocks, just before you get to the bottom. You can also rent boats here (from €90 for two hours).
In what were once fishermen’s houses, there is a quartet of restaurants and a couple of diving operators.
