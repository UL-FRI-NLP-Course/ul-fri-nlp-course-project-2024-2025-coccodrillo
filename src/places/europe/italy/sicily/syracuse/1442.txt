Museo del Papiro | Syracuse, Sicily |  Ortygia's Museo del Papiro offers a fine collection of papyrus documents and products, including artefacts from antiquity. There's also an English-language film about the nifty material's history. That Syracuse has a museum dedicated to papyrus is not coincidental; the papyrus plant grows in abundance around the nearby Ciane River, and was used to make paper in the 18th century.
