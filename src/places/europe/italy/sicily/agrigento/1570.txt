Tempio dei Dioscuri | Agrigento, Sicily |  Four columns mark the Tempio dei Dioscuri, also known as the Temple of Castor and Pollux. Built towards the end of the 5th century, it was destroyed by the Carthaginians, later restored in Hellenistic style, and then destroyed again by an earthquake. What you see today dates from 1832, when it was rebuilt using materials from other temples.
