Fontana del Nettuno | Messina, Sicily |  Located where Via Garibaldi spills into Piazza dell'Unit√† d'Italia, the 16th-century Fontana del Nettuno (Neptune's Fountain) is one of Messina's great fountains. Created by Florentine sculptor Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, its figures are actually copies: the original Nettuno and one of the mostri (monsters) are housed in the city's outstanding Museo Regionale Interdisciplinare.
