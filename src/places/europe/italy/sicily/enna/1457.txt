Museo Archeologico di Palazzo Varisano | Enna, Sicily |  Enna's archaeological museum houses a good collection of local artefacts (labelled in Italian) excavated from throughout the region, as well as objects borrowed from the archaeological museums of both Syracuse and Agrigento. Of particular interest is the Attic-style red-and-black krater (drinking vase), found in the town itself and dating back to the 5th century BC.
