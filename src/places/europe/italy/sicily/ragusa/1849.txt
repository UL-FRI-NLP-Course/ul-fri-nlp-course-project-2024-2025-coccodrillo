Portale San Giorgio Vecchio | Ragusa, Sicily |  On the street to the right of the entrance of the Giardino Ibleo, eye up the Catalan Gothic portal of what was once the large Chiesa di San Giorgio Vecchio, now mostly ruined. The lunette features an interesting bas-relief of St George slaying the dragon.
