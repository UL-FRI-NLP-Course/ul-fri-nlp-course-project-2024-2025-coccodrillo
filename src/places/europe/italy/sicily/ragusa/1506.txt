Fintan Magee Mural | Ragusa, Sicily |  Titled 'The Farmer' and spanning the side of a seven-storey apartment building, this epic mural is the work of prolific Australian street artist Fintan Magee. An ode to the region, the naturalistic work depicts a bearded farmer trimming an orange tree. The mural was commissioned as part of the 2016 edition of Ragusa's now-defunct FestiWall street-art festival.
