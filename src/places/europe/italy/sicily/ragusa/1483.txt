Chiesa di Santa Maria delle Scale | Ragusa, Sicily |  The salita commendatore, a winding pass made up of stairs and narrow archways linking the new town with the old, leads past the Chiesa di Santa Maria delle Scale, a 13th-century Gothic church restyled and extended in the baroque style after the devastating earthquake of 1693. The church offers a good viewing point across the town and surrounding countryside.
