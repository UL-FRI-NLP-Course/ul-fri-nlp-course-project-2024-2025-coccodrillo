Chiesa di San Giuliano | Erice, Sicily |  Built by the Normans in the 11th century, this church later underwent extensive reconstruction, including the addition of an 18th-century baroque bell tower. The interior holds a collection of religious sculptures (the Gruppo dei Misteri) that are paraded through town annually in Erice's Good Friday processions.
A combined Passepartout ticket (â‚¬6) covers admission to the cathedral and its bell tower and Chiesa di San Martino.
