Chiesa di Santa Maria del Soccorso | Ischia, Italy |  This diminutive white church perched above the water in the town centre was originally part of a 14th-century Augustinian monastery; its side chapel and dome were added in 1791 and 1854 respectively, the latter rebuilt after the 1883 earthquake. The 18th-century mismatched majolica tiles adorning the sea-scarred staircase out the front are truly beautiful â€“ as is the view beyond.
