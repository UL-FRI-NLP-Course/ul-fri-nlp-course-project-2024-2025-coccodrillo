Marina della Lobra | Massa Lubrense, Italy |  From central Largo Vescovado itâ€™s a 1.5km descent to this pretty little marina backed by ramshackle houses and verdant slopes. The marina is a good place to rent a boat, the best way of reaching the otherwise difficult-to-get-to bays and inlets along the coast.
