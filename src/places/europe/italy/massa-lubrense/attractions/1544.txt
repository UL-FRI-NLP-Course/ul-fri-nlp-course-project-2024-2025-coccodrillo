Chiesa di Santa Maria della Grazia | Massa Lubrense, Italy |  The town's former cathedral, 16th-century Chiesa di Santa Maria della Grazia, is worth a quick look for its bright majolica-tiled floor, which would look so good in your kitchen back home. The church stands on the northern flank of the central Largo Vescovado. Donâ€™t forget your camera, as there are fabulous views over to Capri from here.
