Torre di Barbaresco | Langhe, Roero & Monferrato, Italy |  Take the lift to the rooftop of this restored medieval tower for a sublime view over wine country. You'll see the meandering Tanaro River, various other settlements (Alba, Neive, Treiso, Asti) and the vineyard-covered rolling hills of Langhe and Roero stretching off to the horizon.
You can also enjoy wine tastings on the breezy terrace here, with four different wines available (â‚¬5 per glass).
