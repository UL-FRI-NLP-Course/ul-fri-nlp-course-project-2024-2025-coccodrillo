La Torre | Corniglia, Italy |  This viewpoint overlooking a photogenic stretch of coastline (direction: Manarola) is reached by a stairway that leads up from the diminutive main square, Piazza Taragio. The tiny square is also a favourite spot among Corniglia's youngest residents to kick around a football.
