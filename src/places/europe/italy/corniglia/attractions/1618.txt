Guvano Beach | Corniglia, Italy |  This lovely, hard-to-reach beach was once a famous nudist spot from the 1960s to the 1990s, when it was accessed by walking through an abandoned railway tunnel. Unfortunately, landslides have led to the tunnel's closure, and the only way to reach Guvano today involves hiring a kayak or arranging a visit on a private boat tour.
