Via Giordano | Naples, Italy |  Named after the great Neapolitan baroque artist Luca Giordano, this partly pedestrianised street is peppered with shops, cafes and strolling crowds of middle-class Neapolitans. The block between Via Stanzione and Via De Mura is home to a row of kiosks selling books (mostly in Italian), CDs and DVDs, and prints of classic film posters.
