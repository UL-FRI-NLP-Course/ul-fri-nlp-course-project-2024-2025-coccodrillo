Via Scarlatti | Naples, Italy |  This bustling Vomero thoroughfare takes its name from Sicilian-born Alessandro Scarlatti, a famous baroque composer known as the founder of the Neapolitan school of opera. The street itself is famous for its shops and cafes, which draw no shortage of well-to-do Neapolitans out for coffee or a spot of retail therapy.
In the middle of the strip is Ernesto Tatafiore's controversial fountain, Fontana Itaca di Tatafiore, which some locals derisively liken to a market tub for eels.
