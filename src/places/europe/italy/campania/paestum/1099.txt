Tempio di Nettuno | Paestum, Italy |  Dating from about 450 BC, the limestone Tempio di Nettuno is the largest and best preserved of Paestum's trio of temples; only parts of its inside walls and roof are missing. The two rows of double-storied columns originally divided the outer colonnade from the cella (inner chamber), where a statue of the temple deity would have been displayed. Despite its commonly used name, many scholars believe that the temple was actually dedicated to the Greek goddess Hera, sister and wife of Zeus.
