Spiaggia di Chiaia | Procida, Italy |  Procida has limited beach appeal, but this long, narrow ribbon of brownish sand with views of Marina Corricella in the distance has a loyal local following. Entry is via a stairway off Via Pizzaco, or you can sail in from Marina Corricella or kayak from Marina Chiaiolella. You'll find seafood restaurant La Conchiglia here.
