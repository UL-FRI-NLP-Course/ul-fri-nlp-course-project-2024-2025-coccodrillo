Sedile Dominova | Sorrento, Italy |  Incongruously wedged between racks of lemon-themed souvenir merchandise, this 15th-century domed palazzo (mansion) has exquisite, albeit faded, original frescoes. Crowned by a cupola, the terrace, open to the street on two sides, was originally a meeting point for the town’s medieval aristocracy; today it houses a working-men’s club where local pensioners sit around playing cards.
