Gallery Celentano | Sorrento, Italy |  From the Chiostro di San Francesco, stairs lead up to this gallery, which showcases the evocative photography of Raffaele Celentano, a contemporary photographer who spends his time between Sorrento and Munich. The gallery's long-term exhibition – a retrospective of Celentano's work over the past quarter of a century – offers some revealing glimpses into the Italian way of life.
The space includes a terrace overlooking the Bay of Naples, as well as a small shop selling limited-edition prints of Celentano's photographs.
