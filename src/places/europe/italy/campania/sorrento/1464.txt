Palazzo Veniero | Sorrento, Italy |  Tucked away on one of Sorrento's original Graeco-Roman decumani (main streets), the Palazzo Veniero is considered a rare and precious example of Arab-Byzantine architecture in southern Italy. Despite being heavily altered since its construction in the 13th century, the building's geometric grey-and-yellow tuff-stone arches have a distinctly Middle Eastern flavour.
