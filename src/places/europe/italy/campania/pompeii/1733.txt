Macellum | Pompeii, Italy |  Dating from the 2nd century BC, the macellum was the city's main produce market. Note the 12 bases at the centre of the market, which were once stands for the timber poles that supported the market's conical roof. Surviving frescoes reveal some of the goods for sale, including prawns.
