Marina Piccola | Capri, Italy |  Little more than a series of private bathing facilities, Marina Piccola is on the southern side of the island, directly south of Marina Grande. A short bus ride from Capri Town, or a downhill 15-minute walk, it has a 50m-long public pebble beach hemmed in by the Scoglio delle Sirene (Rock of the Sirens) at the western end and the Torre Saracena at the other. The swimmingâ€™s not great, but the two rocks rising out of the water about 10m offshore make excellent diving boards.
