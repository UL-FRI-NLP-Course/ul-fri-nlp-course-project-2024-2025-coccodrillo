Isole Faraglioni | Capri, Italy |  These three limestone pinnacles rise vertically out of the sea just south of the Belvedere di Tragara, from where you can admire them. Measuring 109m, 81m and 104m respectively, the isole are home to a rare blue lizard that was once thought to be unique to the Faraglioni but has since been found on the Sicilian coast.
