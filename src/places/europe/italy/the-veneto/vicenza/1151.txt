Villa Valmarana ‘ai Nani’ | Vicenza, Italy |  From La Rotonda, a charming footpath leads about 500m to the neoclassical elegance of Villa Valmarana ‘ai Nani’, nicknamed after the 17 statues of dwarves ('ai Nani') around the perimeter walls. Step inside for 18th-century frescoes by Giambattista Tiepolo and his son Giandomenico. Giambattista painted the Palazzina wing with his signature mythological epics, while his offspring executed the rural, carnival and Chinese themes adorning the foresteria (guesthouse).
