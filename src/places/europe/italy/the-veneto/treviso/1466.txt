Chiesa di San Nicol√≤ | Treviso, Italy |  This unusual, soaring Gothic structure dates to the 13th and 14th centuries, although much of what you see today was rebuilt after devastating air strikes in WWII. Inside, frescoes by Tommaso da Modena line the walls, depicting important Dominicans, whose order still inhabit the seminary next door. Other frescoes by Renaissance talent Lorenzo Lotto line the Cappella Oniga.
