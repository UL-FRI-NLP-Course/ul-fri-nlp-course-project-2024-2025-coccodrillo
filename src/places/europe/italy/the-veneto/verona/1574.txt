Teatro Romano e Museo Archeologico | Verona, Italy |  Just north of the historic centre youâ€™ll find a Roman theatre. Built in the 1st century BC, it is cunningly carved into the hillside at a strategic spot overlooking a bend in the river. Take the lift at the back of the theatre to the former convent above, which houses an interesting collection of Greek and Roman pieces.
