Viewpoint | Trastevere & Gianicolo, Rome |  Many of the vaunted viewpoints along Gianicolo (aka Janiculum) are obscured by trees, but this lesser known overlook at the north end has sweeping views across Rome. There's a small cafe, a few benches, the usual weeds and a bittersweet little toy stand selling gifts for patients in the nearby children's hospital, Ospedale pediatrico Bambin Ges√π.
