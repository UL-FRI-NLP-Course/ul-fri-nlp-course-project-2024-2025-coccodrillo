Complesso Monumentale Santo Spirito in Sassia | Vatican City, Borgo & Prati, Rome |  Originally an 8th-century lodging for Saxon pilgrims, this ancient hospital complex was established by Pope Innocent III in the late 12th century. Three hundred years later Sixtus IV added an octagonal courtyard and two vast frescoed halls, known collectively as the Corsia Sistina (Sistine Ward).
