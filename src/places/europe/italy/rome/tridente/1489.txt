Piazza Barberini | Tridente, Trevi & the Quirinale, Rome |  More a traffic thoroughfare than a place to linger, this noisy square is named after the Barberini family, one of Romeâ€™s great dynastic clans. It's home to two Bernini-designed fountains, the Fontana del Tritone in the centre and the Fontana delle Api in square's northeastern corner.
