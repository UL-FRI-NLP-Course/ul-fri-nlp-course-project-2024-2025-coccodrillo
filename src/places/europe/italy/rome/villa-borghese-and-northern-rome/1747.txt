Piazza di Siena | Rome, Lazio |  A dusty arena surrounded by towering umbrella pines, Piazza di Siena is used to host Rome's top equestrian event in May. It was created in the late 18th century at the behest of the Borghese prince Marcantonio IV and named after the city of Siena, the Borghese family's original home town.
