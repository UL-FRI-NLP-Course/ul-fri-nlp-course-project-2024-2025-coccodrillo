Casina delle Civette | Rome, Lazio |  In Villa Torlonia park, the Casina delle Civette is a bizarre mix of Swiss cottage, Gothic castle and twee farmhouse decorated in art-nouveau style. Built between 1840 and 1930, it's now a museum dedicated to stained glass with designs and sketches, decorative tiles, parquet floors and woodwork.
