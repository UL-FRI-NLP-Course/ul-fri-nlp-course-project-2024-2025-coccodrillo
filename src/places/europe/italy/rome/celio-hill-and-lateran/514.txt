Porta San Paolo | San Giovanni & Testaccio, Rome |  Built after the barbariansâ€™ invasion of Rome, the remarkably well-preserved Porta San Paolo once served as a southern gate in the 3rd-century Aurelian Walls. Today, it houses a small museum dedicated to the history of Via Ostiense, an essential arterial road in ancient times. The space also displays priceless inscriptions, frescoes and paintings recovered throughout history.
