Giardino degli Aranci | San Giovanni & Testaccio, Rome |  Officially called the Parco Savello but known to every Roman as the Giardino degli Aranci (Orange Garden), this walled park is a romantic haven. Head down the central avenue, passing towering umbrella pines and lawns planted with blooming orange trees, to bask in heavenly sunset views of St Peterâ€™s dome and the city's rooftops.
