Basilica dei SS Giovanni e Paolo al Celio | San Giovanni & Testaccio, Rome |  A popular wedding location, this handsome medieval church dates to the 4th century when it was built over the houses of two Roman martyrs. It has since been much altered, though you can still explore the ancient houses that lie beneath it, the so-called Case Romane.
