Battistero Lateranense | San Giovanni & Testaccio, Rome |  Built by Constantine in the 4th century, this octagonal baptistery served as the prototype for later Christian churches and bell towers. The chief point of interest, apart from the architecture, are the decorative mosaics, some of which date to the 5th century.
