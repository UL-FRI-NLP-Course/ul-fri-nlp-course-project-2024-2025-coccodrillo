Area Sacra | Centro Storico, Rome |  This sunken area in the Largo di Torre Argentina, reckoned to be the site of Julius Caesar's murder, contains the remains of four Republican-era temples, all built between the 2nd and 4th centuries BC. These ruins, which are among the oldest in the city, are home to a thriving population of around 300 stray cats and a volunteer-run cat sanctuary. As of June 2023, visitors can now access the site up close thanks to new renovations.
