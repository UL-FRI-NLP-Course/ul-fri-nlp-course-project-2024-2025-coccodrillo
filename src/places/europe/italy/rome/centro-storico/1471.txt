Stadio di Domiziano | Centro Storico, Rome |  Beneath Piazza Navona lie the remains of the 1st-century-AD Stadio di Domiziano, over which the square was laid out in the 15th century. This 30,000-seat arena, the first masonry stadium ever built in Rome, was used to stage athletic meets â€“ hence the name Navona, a corruption of the Greek word agon, meaning public games.
