Chiesa di Sant'Agnese in Agone | Centro Storico, Rome |  With its theatrical facade and rich, domed interior, the Chiesa di Sant’Agnese in Agone is typical of Francesco Borromini’s baroque style. The church, which regularly hosts concerts of sacred music, is said to stand on the spot where the martyr Agnes performed a miracle before being killed. Legend has it that after being stripped naked by her executioners her hair miraculously grew to cover her body and preserve her modesty.
