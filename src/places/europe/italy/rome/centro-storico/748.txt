Fontana delle Tartarughe | Centro Storico, Rome |  This playful, much-loved fountain features four boys gently hoisting tortoises up into a bowl of water. Created by Giacomo della Porta and Taddeo Landini in the late 16th century, it's the subject of a popular local legend, according to which it was created in a single night.
The story goes that the Duke of Mattei had it built to save his engagement and prove to his prospective father-in-law that despite gambling his fortune away, he was still a good catch. Amazingly, it worked and the impressed father allowed Mattei to marry his daughter.In reality, the fountain was no overnight sensation and took three years to craft (1581â€“1584). The tortoises, after whom it's named, were added by Bernini during a restoration in 1658.
