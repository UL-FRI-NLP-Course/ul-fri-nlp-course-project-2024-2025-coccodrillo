Lorcan O'Neill Gallery | Centro Storico, Rome |  The brainchild of Irish gallerist Lorcan O'Neill, this contemporary art gallery calls the former 17th-century stables of Palazzo Santacroce home. It promotes international up-and-coming artists and exhibits the works of established names such as Jeff Wall and Rachel Whiteread. The gallery also hosts readings, screenings and performances both inside and in the outdoor courtyard.
