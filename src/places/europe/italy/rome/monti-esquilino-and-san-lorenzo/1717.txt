Aula Ottagona | Monti, Esquilino & San Lorenzo, Rome |  Hidden behind a stark rectangular facade, the Aula Ottagona (Octangonal Classroom) was once part of the Diocletian Bath complex. In the 1920s the huge cupola was used as a planetarium. The beautiful vaulted space is now part of the Museo Nazionale Romano and hosts occasional temporary exhibitions.
