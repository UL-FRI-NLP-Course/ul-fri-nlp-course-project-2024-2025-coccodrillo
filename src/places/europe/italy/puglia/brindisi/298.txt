Tempio di San Giovanni al Sepolcro | Brindisi, Puglia |  This 12th-century church, a brown bulk of Norman stone conforming to the circular plan the Templars so loved, is a wonderfully evocative structure, austere and bare. You'll see vestigial medieval frescoes on the walls, and glimpses of the crypt below. The church was a popular stop for Crusaders travelling to and from the Holy Land. Don't miss the expansive gardens at the rear of the building.
