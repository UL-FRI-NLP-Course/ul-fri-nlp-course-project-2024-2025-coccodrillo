Cathedral | Brindisi, Puglia |  This 12th-century cathedral was substantially remodelled after an earthquake in 1743. You can see how the original Romanesque structure may have looked by studying the nearby Porta dei Cavalieri Templari, a fanciful portico with pointy arches â€“ all that remains of a medieval Knights Templar church that once also stood here.
