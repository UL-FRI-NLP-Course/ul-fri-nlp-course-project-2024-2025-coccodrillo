Porta dei Cavalieri Templari | Brindisi, Puglia |  After the Romans, the next big event to hit Brindisi was the Crusades during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Porta dei Cavalieri Templari, an exotic-looking portico with pointy arches, is thought to be all that remains of the Knights Templar's main church (although some doubt has been cast on that by recent scholarship). It stands beside the cathedral in the heart of the small historic quarter.
