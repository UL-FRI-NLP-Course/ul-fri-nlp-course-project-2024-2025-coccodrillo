Museo Diocesano d'Arte Sacra | Lecce, Puglia |  This 18th-century seminary, designed by famous Leccese architect and sculptor Giuseppe Cino, today houses a library of old books and a museum dedicated to sacred art. Focusing on Lecce's diocese and its history in particular, it exhibits paintings, sculpture, silverware and other liturgical artefacts, and is well worth a visit.
