Rione Aia Piccola | Alberobello, Puglia |  On the eastern side of Via Indipendenza is Rione Aia Piccola. This neighbourhood is much less commercialised than Rione Monti, with 400 trulli, many still used as family dwellings. You can climb up for a rooftop view at many shops, although most do have a strategically located basket for donations.
