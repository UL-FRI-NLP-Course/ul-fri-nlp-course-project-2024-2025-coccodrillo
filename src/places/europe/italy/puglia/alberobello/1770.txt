Rione Monti | Alberobello, Puglia |  Within the old town quarter of Rione Monti more than 1000 trulli cascade down the hillside, many of which are now souvenir shops. The area is surprisingly quiet and atmospheric in the late evening, once the day trippers have left and the gaudy stalls have been stashed away.
