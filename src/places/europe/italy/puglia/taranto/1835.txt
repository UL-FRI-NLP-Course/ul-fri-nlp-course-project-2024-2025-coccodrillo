Temple of Poseidon | Taranto, Puglia |  This 6th-century BC Doric temple is one of the few visible remains of the once-great Greek colony of Taras. The last two surviving columns and the foundations, while only a vestige of the original, give a sense of its scale and the quality of its construction.
