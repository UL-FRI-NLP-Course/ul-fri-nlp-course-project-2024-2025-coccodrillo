Fortezza Medicea | Siena, Tuscany |  Built by order of Cosimo de' Medici in 1563, this fortified brick castle was decommissioned as a military barracks in the late 18th century and converted into a public park. It's now a popular leisure facility where locals come to relax in the garden or jog around the perimeter. There are panoramic city views from the ramparts and bastions.
