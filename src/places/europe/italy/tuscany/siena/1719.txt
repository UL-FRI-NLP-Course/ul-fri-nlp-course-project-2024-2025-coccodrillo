Palazzo Tolomei | Siena, Tuscany |  This towering Gothic structure with double lancet windows was built in stone between 1205â€“1212 for the Tolomei family, Guelph bankers. It now houses the main local branch of Banca Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze (aka Banca CR Firenze) and was undergoing a major renovation at the time of research.
