Museo Marino Marini | Pistoia, Tuscany |  This gallery inside Palazzo del Tau is devoted to Pistoia's most famous modern son, sculptor and painter Marino Marini (1901–80). Dozens of his drawings and paintings – mainly of female nudes (pear-shaped, evoking goddess of fertility Pomona) and horses – hang here.
Combination tickets with other city-run museums are available.
