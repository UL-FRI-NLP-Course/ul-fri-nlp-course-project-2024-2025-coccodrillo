Battistero di San Giovanni | Pistoia, Tuscany |  Across the square from the cathedral is its 14th-century octagonal baptistry, elegantly banded in green-and-white marble to a design by Andrea Pisano. An ornate square marble font and soaring dome enliven the otherwise bare, red-brick interior. Buy tickets here for the Capella di San Jacopo and bell tower, both inside Cattedrale di San Zeno.
