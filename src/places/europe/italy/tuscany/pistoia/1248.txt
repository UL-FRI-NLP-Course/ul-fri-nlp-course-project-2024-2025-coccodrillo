Museo Civico | Pistoia, Tuscany |  Pistoia's Gothic Palazzo Communale is strung with works by Tuscan artists from the 13th to 20th centuries. Don't miss Bernardino di Antonio Detti's Madonna della Pergola (1498) with its modern treatment of St James, the Madonna and Baby Jesus; spot the mosquito on Jesus' arm.
Combination tickets with other city-run museums are available.
