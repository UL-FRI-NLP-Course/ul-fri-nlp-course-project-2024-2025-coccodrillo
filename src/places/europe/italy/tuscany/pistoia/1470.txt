Piazzetta degli Ortaggi | Pistoia, Tuscany |  Don't miss this beautiful small square, with its laid-back cafe life and striking, life-size sculpture of three blindfolded men, Giro di Sole (Around the Sun; 1996), by contemporary Pistoia artist Roberto Barni (b 1939). In the 18th century the market square, adjoining Piazza della Sala, was the entrance to Pistoia's Jewish ghetto.
