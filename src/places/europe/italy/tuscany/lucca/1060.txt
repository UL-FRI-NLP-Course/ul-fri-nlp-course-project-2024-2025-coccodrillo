Museo Nazionale di Palazzo Mansi | Lucca, Tuscany |  This 16th-century mansion built for a wealthy Luccan merchant is a wonderful piece of rococo excess. The private apartments are draped head to toe in tapestries, paintings and chintz. The elaborate, gilded bridal suite must have inspired many high jinks in its time.
