Torre Guinigi | Lucca, Tuscany |  The bird's-eye view from the top of this medieval, 45m-tall red-brick tower adjoining 14th-century Palazzo Guinigi is predictably magnificent. But what impresses even more are the seven oak trees planted in a U-shaped flower bed at the top of the tower. Legend has it that upon the death of powerful Lucchese ruler Paolo Guinigi (1372–1432) all the leaves fell off the trees. Count 230 steps to the top.
A combination ticket covering the Torre del'Ore or the Orto Botanico is €6/4; all three sights combined cost €9/6.
