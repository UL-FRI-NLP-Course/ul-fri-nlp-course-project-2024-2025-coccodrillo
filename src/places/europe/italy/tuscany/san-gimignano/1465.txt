Museo d'Arte Sacra | San Gimignano, Tuscany |  Works of medieval religious art from San Gimignano's key churches are on display in this modest museum. Particularly beautiful items made from precious metals include crafted chalices and thuribles (censers); there are also some exquisitely embroidered textiles.
A combined ticket to the museum and Collegiata costs adult/reduced €6/3, offering a saving of €1.50/1.
