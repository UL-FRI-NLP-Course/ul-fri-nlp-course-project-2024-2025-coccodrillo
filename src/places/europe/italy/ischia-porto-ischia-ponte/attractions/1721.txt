Spiaggia dei Pescatori | Ischia, Italy |  Wedged in between Ischia Porto and Ischia Ponte is the island's most down-to-earth seaside beach â€“ think colourful vintage fishing boats, soccer matches on the sand and a looming castle perched high above in the distance. Its easy accessibility and sheltered water make it popular with families.
