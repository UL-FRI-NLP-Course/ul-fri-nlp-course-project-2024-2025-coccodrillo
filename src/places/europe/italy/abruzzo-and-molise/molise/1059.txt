Samnite Theatre-Temple Complex | Molise, Italy |  About 30km northeast of Isernia, outside Pietrabbondante, the remains of a 3rd-century-BC Samnite theatre-temple complex reward a visit, as much as anything for their panoramic setting high above the rolling green countryside. The 2500-seat theatre is in good enough shape to be used for performances to this day, although less remains of the temples.
SATI buses run between Isernia and Pietrabbondante twice a day (â‚¬1.65, 40 minutes), albeit at inconvenient times.
