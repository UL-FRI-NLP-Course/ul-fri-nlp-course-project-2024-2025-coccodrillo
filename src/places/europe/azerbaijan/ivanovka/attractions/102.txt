İvanovka | Azerbaijan, Europe |  Although lacking any real 'sights', this unique hilltop village is culturally Russian-Molokan and is about the last place in the country to maintain its Soviet-style collective farm. It's famed for fresh produce, wine and honey and has two guesthouses.
İvanovka is around 15km south of İsmayıllı, around AZN8 by taxi.
