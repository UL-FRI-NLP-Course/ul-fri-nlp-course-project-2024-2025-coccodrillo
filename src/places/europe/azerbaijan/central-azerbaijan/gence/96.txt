Cümә Mosque | Azerbaijan, Europe |  The 1606 Cümə Mosque features a disconnected double minaret and is credited to Persian Shah Abbas, in whose reign it was built.
It's a working mosque but visitors are welcome outside of prayer times. Nearby, the small, heavily renovated tomb tower is of Cavad Xan, the last ruler of the independent khanate of Gəncə (r 1786–1804).
