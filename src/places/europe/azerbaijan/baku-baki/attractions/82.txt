Cümə Mosque | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Though it appears relatively squat seen from outside, the interior of the Old City's carving-festooned 'Friday' mosque contains beautifully patterned interior vaults around a central dome and chandelier. The current structure dates from 1899, albeit built on the site of a 12th-century original with a minaret from 1437.
It's an active mosque but outside prayer times, visitors are welcome.
