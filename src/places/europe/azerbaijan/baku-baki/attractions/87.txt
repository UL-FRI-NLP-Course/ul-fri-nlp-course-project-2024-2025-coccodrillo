Sınıq Qala Mosque | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Partly dating from at least 1079, this little mosque is considered the the oldest still standing in Baku. Its nickname, 'Sinıq Qala' (Broken Tower), was gained when its typical local-style minaret was left damaged by a 1723 Russian naval bombardment. It was repaired around a century later but the name stuck.
The interior is not usually open to visitors.
