Crescent Moon Building | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Several gleaming towers are under construction at Crescent Bay opposite Port Baku, including a potentially phenomenal architectural attention-grabber in the form of a gigantic upside-down crescent moon. That building remains unfinished – construction is reportedly stalled due to technical problems with the upper curve – but once finished it should be yet another great architectural legacy for the city.
