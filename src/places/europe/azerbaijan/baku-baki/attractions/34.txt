Carpet Museum | Baku, Azerbaijan |  From historic flatweaves to modernist picture-rugs, this tailor-made museum displays and explains a superb collection of Azerbaijani carpets. It's housed in a 2014 building by Austrian architect Franz Janz, designed like a stylised roll of carpet.
The idea probably looked great on paper but does create certain presentation difficulties, with some exhibits awkwardly placed on sloping or curving surfaces.There's a carpet shop here, too, and this is where to come to secure the export permit if you've purchased any carpet over 1 sq metre (closed Sundays; ask for carpet assessment days).
