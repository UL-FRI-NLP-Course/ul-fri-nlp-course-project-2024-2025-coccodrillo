Armenian Church of St Gregory the Illuminator | Baku, Azerbaijan |  The sturdy shell of this 1887 stone church remains disused for lack of Armenians, a reminder of the brutal cultural divide that remains as the fallout of the war in Karabakh. The structure was partially restored in 2004 but is not open to visitors.
