Tahir Salahov House Museum | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Tahir Salahov is probably Azerbaijan's greatest living painter, best known for bringing deep emotional intensity into Soviet Realism. The Baku house where he lived has a good if mostly later collection of his works, but there's added interest from some wonderfully naive Stalin-era carpets plus a fascinating range of photos of the artist meeting everyone from Leonid Brezhnev to Michael Jackson.
