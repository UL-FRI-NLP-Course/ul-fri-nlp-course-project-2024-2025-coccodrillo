Fəxri Xiyaban | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Since 1948 this attractively tree-shaded graveyard has been set aside as the last resting place for Azerbaijan's foremost public figures. Many of the memorials are impressive works of statuary.
Former president Heydar Əliyev’s tomb, located here, is the first place that any dignitary is likely to be taken during an official visit to Baku.
