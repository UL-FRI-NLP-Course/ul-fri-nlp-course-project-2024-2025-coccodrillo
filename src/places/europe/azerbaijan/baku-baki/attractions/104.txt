Clock Pylon | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Looking somewhere between an electricity pylon and an oil derrick, this digital clock forms a central Bulvar landmark.
It was once the launch pad for a 1960s form of base-jumping. In the surrounding areas of Bulvar Park, spot the trio of rare baobabs, two ancient olive trees and a splendid little cactus garden.
