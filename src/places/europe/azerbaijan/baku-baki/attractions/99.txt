Dom Soviet | Baku, Azerbaijan |  Baku's most striking Soviet-era building is a gigantic stone construction fronted by an impressive series of layered stone arches and topped by rows of mini obelisks.
It's at its most photogenic when uplit in the early evening, seen either from the upper floors of the JW Marriott Hotel or from the fountain pools across the Bulvar.
