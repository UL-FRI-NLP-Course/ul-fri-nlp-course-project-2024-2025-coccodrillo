Şəbəkə Workshop | Azerbaijan, Europe |  The şəbəkə (stained-glass windows) featured at Xan Sarayı are laboriously made by slotting together hundreds of hand-carved wooden pieces to create intricate wooden frames without metal fastenings. You can see them being produced at this no-hassle family workshop where young apprentices are learning the trade in the back room behind an unmarked little shop where examples are sold and explained.
Opening times vary.
