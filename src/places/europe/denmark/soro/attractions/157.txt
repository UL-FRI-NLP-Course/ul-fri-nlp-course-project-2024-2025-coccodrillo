Sorø Kunstmuseum | Zealand, Denmark |  Flaunting an award-winning extension by Copenhagen-based architects Lundgaard & Tranberg, Sorø Kunstmuseum has regularly changing exhibitions of art both modern and classic, but what you will reliably be able to see is part of Denmark's largest collection of Russian icons, and usually a selection of 19th-century Danish 'Golden Age' paintings.
The contemporary cafe section hosts regular events including low-key live music several times a month.
