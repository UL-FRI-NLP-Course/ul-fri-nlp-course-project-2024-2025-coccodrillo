Ludvig Holberg Statue | Zealand, Denmark |  Stroll Sorø Akademi's western gardens to find a tricorn-hatted bronze figure whose plinth rises above two toga-sporting thespian nymphs. The statue portrays the great Dano-Norwegian humanist playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) whose massive financial bequest of 1750 (re)established the Sorø Akademi in its classical form.
