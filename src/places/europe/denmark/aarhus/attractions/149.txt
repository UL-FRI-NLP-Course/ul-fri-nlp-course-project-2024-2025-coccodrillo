Aarhus Ø | Aarhus, Denmark |  Aarhus' docklands is a new neighbourhood that's home to some head-turning residential developments – the brilliantly spiky Isberget (Iceberg) has won architecture awards and lots of Instagram fans. The district is worth a wander for some cool sea and city views and excellent architecture. The popular summertime Strandbaren is here.Bus 33 runs out this way, but biking is a good option.
