Adelgade | Central Jutland, Denmark |  Cobbled Adelgade is one of the loveliest main streets in Jutland, lined with pastel-coloured cafes and stores, and pretty courtyards. At its southern end is the diminutive old town hall, built in 1789. It has a half-timbered, chocolate-box appearance (it's a popular spot for weddings) and is now home to local history exhibits (free admission).
