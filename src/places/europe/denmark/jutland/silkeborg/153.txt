Aqua | Central Jutland, Denmark |  Aqua, 2km south of the town centre, is an entertaining aquarium, zoo and exhibition centre built into several outdoor lakes. It explores the ecosystems of the area, with lots of touch-tanks and fishy creatures, cute otters and birds among the imaginative displays. Closing times vary, from 4pm in winter to 8pm in July.
Local bus 4 runs down this way, but a nicer option in summer is to take a boat with Hjejlen Boat Company.
