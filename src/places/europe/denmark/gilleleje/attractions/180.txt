Fyrhistorik Museum p√• Nakkehoved | Zealand, Denmark |  Strolling east from Gilleleje along the coastal footpath, you'll come to a pair of lighthouses. The western one (Vestre Fyr) contains a small museum, but it's worth continuing around 300m further to the second one, if only to grab a drink at the associated restaurant Fyrkroen 1772, which has idyllic views from its terrace.
