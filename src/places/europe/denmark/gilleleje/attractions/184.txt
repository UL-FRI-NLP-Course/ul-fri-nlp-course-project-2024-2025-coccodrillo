Kierkegaard Memorial | Zealand, Denmark |  On the clifftop path between the Badehotel and the Gilbjerghoved birdwatching area is a simply inscribed boulder that commemorates the visits to this coastline of the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–55).
The quotation is his 1835 musing meaning 'What is truth other than an idea given life?'.
