Nexø Museum | Bornholm, Denmark |  In a handsome 1796 sandstone building opposite the waterfront, the modest yet endearing Nexø Museum features intriguing exhibits on Nexø’s history, including photos of Nexø before the bombs of WWII and wartime artefacts such as Nazi and Russian military helmets. Other curiosities include cannons, vintage toiletries and an old-school 150kg diving suit.
