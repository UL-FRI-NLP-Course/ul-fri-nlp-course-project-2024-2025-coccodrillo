Store Tårn | Bornholm, Denmark |  Built in 1684, Christiansø’s Store Tårn is an impressive structure measuring a full 25m in diameter, and the tower’s 100-year-old lighthouse offers a sweeping 360-degree view of the island. After major restoration work, the tower reopened in June 2017 with new exhibits on local history and birdlife.
