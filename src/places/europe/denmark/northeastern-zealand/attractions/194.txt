Esrum Kloster | Zealand, Denmark |  While only a shadow of its vast, pre-Reformation self, the former monastery at Esrum remains attractive and really comes into its own during the various medieval fairs held in the grounds.
Esrum is on bus route 362, which links Helsingør and Mårum (a station on the Hillerød–Gilleleje railway line).
