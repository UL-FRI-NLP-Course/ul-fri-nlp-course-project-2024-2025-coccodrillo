Sankt Hans Kirke | Odense, Denmark |  Though most of the triple-transept brick structure you see today dates from 1880, there has been a church on this spot since before 1295, and for much of the Middle Ages it was at the heart of a Templar monastery. Post Reformation it was redeveloped into a palace-castle (Odense Slot, now used as council offices) with direct access to the church still provided across an arched gateway.
