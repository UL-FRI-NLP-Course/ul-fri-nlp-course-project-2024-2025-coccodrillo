Mediemuseum | Odense, Denmark |  Tracing the role of the media in our lives from X Factor to the monastic scriptorium, most of this excellent museum is in Danish and has a Denmark-specific approach. Nonetheless the themes are universal, there's a fine collection of printing presses and loads that's interactive.
Making selfies into magazine covers, laying backing tracks for videos and playing reporter in front of the green screen are all highly entertaining. Free entry on Thursday evenings.
