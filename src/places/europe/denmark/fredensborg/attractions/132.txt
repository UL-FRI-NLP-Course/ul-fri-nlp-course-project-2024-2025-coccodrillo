Normandsdalen | Zealand, Denmark |  Arranged around a circular grassy amphitheatre within Fredensborg palace park are 70 folksy carvings depicting Scandinavian workers of assorted 18th-century professions. They were re-made in sandstone on the orders of King Frederik V who had received miniature versions as wooden dolls from Norwegian postman, JÃ¸rgen Christensen Garnaas.
It's easy enough to walk past them from Skipperhuset and then continue around past the rear of the palace to emerge in Fredensborg town centre.
