Nikolaj Kunsthal | Copenhagen, Denmark |  Built in the 13th century, the church of Sankt Nikolaj is now home to the Copenhagen Contemporary Art Centre, which hosts around half-a-dozen exhibitions annually. Exhibitions tend to focus on modern-day cultural, political and social issues, explored in mediums as diverse as photography and performance art. The centre also houses a snug, well-regarded Danish restaurant called Maven.
