Teatermuseet | Copenhagen, Denmark |  Dating from 1767, the wonderfully atmospheric Hofteater (Old Court Theatre) has hosted everything from Italian opera to local ballet troupes, one of which included fledgling ballet student Hans Christian Andersen. Taking its current appearance in 1842, the venue is now the Theatre Museum, and visitors are free to explore the stage, boxes and dressing rooms, along with displays of set models, drawings, costumes and period posters tracing the history of Danish theatre.
Royal-watchers will enjoy peeking into the royal boxes â€“ Christian VIII's entertainment area comes equipped with its own commode.
