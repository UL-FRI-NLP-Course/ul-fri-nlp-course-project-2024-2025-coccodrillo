Kattegatcentret | Central Jutland, Denmark |  If you fancy being just inches from a shark and in total control, you’ll love the glass tunnel at Kattegatcentret, where the focus is on surrounding sealife. At 2pm you can watch the shark-feeding session – a good way to see just why sharks are at the top of the food chain. There is also a seal pool (and feeding sessions), and a kid-friendly touchpool. Check the website for winter closing dates.
