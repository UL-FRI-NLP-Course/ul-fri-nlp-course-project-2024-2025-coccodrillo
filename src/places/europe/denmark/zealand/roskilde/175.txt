Sankt Jørgensbjerg Kirke | Zealand, Denmark |  Strolling up past a remarkable collection of thatched cottages along Kirkegade and Skt Ibsvej is the highlight of visiting this small 11th-century church.
Along with the Elmelunde Kirke on Møn, the church's core is considered among Denmark's oldest surviving stone buildings, though buttresses, vaulted ceilings and the brick tower were all added in later centuries.
