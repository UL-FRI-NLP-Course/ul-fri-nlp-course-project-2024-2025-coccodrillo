Lützhøfts Købmandsgård & Håndværksmuseet | Zealand, Denmark |  Preserved much as it looked in the 1920s but still functioning as a grocery-hardware shop, Lützhøfts Købmandsgård fronts an enclosed courtyard of old barrows and carriages, plus a lovable tea shop. Upstairs in the green-shuttered mill to the right, a collection of century-old turners' and carpenters' workshops has been preserved complete with old tools.
