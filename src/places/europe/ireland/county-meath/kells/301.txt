Market Cross | County Meath, Ireland |  Until 1996, when it was relocated outside the courthouse on Headfort Pl, the Market Cross had stood for centuries in Cross St, at the heart of the town centre. Besides inviting the pious admiration of the faithful, the cross was used as a gallows in the aftermath of the 1798 Rising; the British garrison hanged rebels from the crosspiece, one on each arm so the cross wouldn't fall over.
