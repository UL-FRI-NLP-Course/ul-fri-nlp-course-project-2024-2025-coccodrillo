Titanic Memorial Park | County Mayo, Ireland |  With the bow of the RMS Titanic cast in bronze and statues of several of the 14 local passengers who were on the ship when it went down, this memorial garden is a place of quiet and poignant repose. The park was created in 2012 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic.
