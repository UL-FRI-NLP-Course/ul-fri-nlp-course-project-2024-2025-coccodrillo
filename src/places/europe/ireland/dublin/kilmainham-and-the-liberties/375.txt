Kilmainham Gate | Dublin, Ireland |  Francis Johnston's impressive Georgian gate was designed in 1812 as the Richmond Tower and located on the quays, near the Guinness Brewery. It was moved here in 1846 as it obstructed the increasingly heavy traffic to the new Kingsbridge Station (Heuston Station), which opened in 1844.
