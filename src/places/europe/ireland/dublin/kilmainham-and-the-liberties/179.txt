Dublin Liberties Distillery | Dublin, Ireland |  Housed in a 400-year-old building is Dublin's newest distillery venture, which opened in 2019 and cements the Liberties' newly established rep as a centre for whiskey production. There's a standard tour, where you learn about the distilling process and finish with a tasting of three whiskeys – the Dubliner, the Dublin Liberties and the Dead Rabbit – although these have all been distilled elsewhere as it'll be at least three years before any of the distillate can be called whiskey.
There's also an Experience tour (€32) where you get to taste six whiskeys, and plans are afoot for a Master Blender experience (€100).
