National Transport Museum | County Dublin, Ireland |  The rather ramshackle National Transport Museum has a range of exhibits including double-decker buses, a bakery van, fire engines and trams â€“ most notably a Hill of Howth electric one that operated from 1901 to 1959. To reach the museum, go through the castle gates and turn right just before the castle.
