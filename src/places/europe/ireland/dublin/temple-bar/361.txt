Mosaic | Temple Bar, Dublin |  Fishamble St, Dublin's oldest street, dates back to Viking times. Brass symbols in the pavement direct you towards a mosaic, just northeast of the overpass between Christ Church Cathedral and Dublinia, laid out to show the ground plan of the sort of Viking dwelling excavated here in the early 1980s.
