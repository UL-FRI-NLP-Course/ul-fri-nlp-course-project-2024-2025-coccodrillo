Oscar Wilde Statue | Dublin, Ireland |  Just inside the northwestern corner of Merrion Sq is a colourful statue of Oscar Wilde, who grew up across the street at No 1 (now used exclusively by the American University Dublin); Wilde wears his customary smoking jacket and reclines on a rock. Atop one of the plinths, daubed with witty one-liners and Wildean throwaways, is a small green statue of Oscarâ€™s pregnant mother.
