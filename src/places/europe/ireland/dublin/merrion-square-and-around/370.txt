Art Market | Dublin, Ireland |  If you fancy picking up a piece of local art directly from the artist, the Sunday art market, where the work of 100 odd artists is hung on the railings of Merrion Sq, is worth an amble. It's been going since 1985 and there's no commission charged as you're buying directly from the artists.
