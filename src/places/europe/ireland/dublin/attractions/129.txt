Magazine Fort | Dublin, Ireland |  Towards Phoenix Park's Parkgate entrance is Magazine Fort on Thomas' Hill. Built between 1734 and 1801, the fort served as an occasional arms depot for the British and later the Irish armies. It was a target during the 1916 Easter Rising and again in 1940, when the IRA made off with the entire ammunitions reserve of the Irish army.
