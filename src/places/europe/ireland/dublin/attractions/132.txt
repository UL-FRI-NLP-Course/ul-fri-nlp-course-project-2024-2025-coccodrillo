Wellington Monument | Dublin, Ireland |  Near the Parkgate St entrance to Phoenix Park is the 63m-high Wellington Monument. It took from 1817 to 1861 to build, mainly because the Duke of Wellington fell from public favour during its construction. Nearby is the People's Garden, dating from 1864, and the bandstand in the Hollow.
