Ashtown Castle | Dublin, Ireland |  The restored four-storey Ashtown Castle is a 17th-century tower house that was 'discovered' inside the 18th-century nuncio's mansion when the latter was demolished in 1986 due to dry rot. You can visit the castle only on a guided tour from the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre.
