Trawmore Beach | County Mayo, Ireland |  Running 3km southeast from Keel, beautiful, Blue Flag, golden-sand Trawmore is among Achill's most photographed beaches. Be aware that there are dangerous rips from its centre to the eastern end (under the Minaun Cliffs). If you're swimming, heed the signs and stick to the western half.
The strand is also good for bracing walks with a backdrop of pounding surf.
