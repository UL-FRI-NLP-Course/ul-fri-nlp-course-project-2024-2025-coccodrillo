Grace O'Malley's Castle | County Mayo, Ireland |  The 40ft-high, 15th-century tower house rising beside the shore at Kildownet is associated with the pirate queen Grace O'Malley. Entering through a steel turnstile is an eerie experience â€“ it reveals a tall hollow shell with slits for windows and a square hole in the roof.
