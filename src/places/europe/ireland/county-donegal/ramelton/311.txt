Old Tullyaughnish Church | County Donegal, Ireland |  The roofless ruins of 17th-century Old Tullyaugnish Church are special because of the Romanesque carvings in the eastern wall, taken from a far older church on nearby Aughnish Island, on the River Lennon. Coming from Letterkenny, turn right at the river, travel around 200m, turn up Church St and it's just after Tank Rd on the right-hand side (opposite the Presbyterian Church).
