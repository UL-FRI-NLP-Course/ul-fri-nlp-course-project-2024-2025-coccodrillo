Tullan Strand | County Donegal, Ireland |  The long strand of surfing beach has a bountiful supply of that gorgeous trademark fine white sand that much of Ireland is famed for. There are rip tides, so swimming can be risky, but the views are stunning and the surfing is grade A. It's north of the town centre; the Roguey Cliff Walk leads here.
