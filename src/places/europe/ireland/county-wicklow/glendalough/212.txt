St Kevin's Kitchen | Glendalough, Ireland |  Glendalough's trademark is St Kevin's Kitchen or Church, at the southern edge of the monastic site. This compact structure, with a miniature round-tower-like belfry, protruding sacristy and steep stone roof, is a masterpiece. It was never a kitchen, instead getting its name because its belfry resembles a kitchen chimney. The oldest parts of the building date from the 11th century â€“ the structure has been remodelled since; but it's still a classic early Irish church.
