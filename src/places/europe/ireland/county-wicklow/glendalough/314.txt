St Kevin's Bed | Glendalough, Ireland |  Just east of Teampall na Skellig, and 10m above the Upper Lake's waters, is the 2m-deep artificial cave called St Kevin's Bed, said to be where Kevin lived. The earliest human habitation of the cave was long before St Kevin's era â€“ there's evidence that people lived in the valley for thousands of years before any monks arrived.
