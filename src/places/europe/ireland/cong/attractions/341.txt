Pigeonhole Cave | County Mayo, Ireland |  This cave, in a pine forest about 1.5km west of Cong, can be reached via a signposted walking loop from the abbey. Steep, slippery stone steps lead down into the cave, where subterranean water flows in winter. Watch for the white trout of Cong â€“ a mythical woman who turned into a fish to be with her drowned lover.
