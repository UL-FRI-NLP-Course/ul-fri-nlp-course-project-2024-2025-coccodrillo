Franciscan Friary | County Donegal, Ireland |  Hidden in a forest at the southern end of the beach, this modern friary was built in the early 1950s and is set in beautiful, tranquil gardens that are open to the public. The Way of the Cross – a religious walk with spectacular views – meanders up a hillside smothered in rhododendrons. The sense of quietude and calmness is enticing. There's a car park here too.
