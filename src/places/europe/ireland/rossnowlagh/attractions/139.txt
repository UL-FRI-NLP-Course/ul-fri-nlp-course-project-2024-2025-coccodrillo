Rossnowlagh Beach | County Donegal, Ireland |  This stunner of a Blue Flag beach is the main draw in town, with the Atlantic surf rolling onto its broad expanse of sand. You can drive your car straight onto the beach as it is a public right of way (which does unfortunately mean that sometimes the beach resembles a vast car park).
