O'Connell's Birthplace | Ring of Kerry, Ireland |  At the bridge across the Carhan River on the eastern edge of town, a neat little memorial park remembers Daniel O'Connell (1775â€“1847), 'the Great Liberator', a political leader who campaigned for Catholic emancipation and Irish independence. He was born in the ruined cottage that stands on the far bank of the river.
