Carrickfinn Beach | County Donegal, Ireland |  Head north of Burtonport on the coast road to reach the picturesque village of Kincasslagh (Cionn Caslach), with ancient cottages perched on top of rocky outcrops and the stunning Blue Flag beach at Carrick Finn. This sweeping stretch of sand with a backdrop of distant mountains remains wonderfully undeveloped, despite being right alongside and parallel to Donegal Airport.
