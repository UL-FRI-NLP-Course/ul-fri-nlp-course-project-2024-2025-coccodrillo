Grace Kelly's Cottage | County Mayo, Ireland |  This tumble down, roofless ruin near Drumgoney Lough (Leg O' Mutton Lake) is the ancestral home of the late actress (and Princess of Monaco) Grace Kelly. Her great grandfather emigrated to America from here in the mid 1800s. It's in Drimurla, some 6km east of Newport.
