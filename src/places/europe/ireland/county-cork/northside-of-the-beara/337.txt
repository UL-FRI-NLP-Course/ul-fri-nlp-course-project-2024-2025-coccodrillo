Derreen Gardens | Beara Peninsula, Ireland |  Derreen Gardens were planted by the fifth Lord Lansdowne around the turn of the 20th century. Mossy paths weave through an abundance of interesting plants, including spectacular New Zealand tree ferns, colourful rhododendrons and red cedars, and you may see seals on the shore. There's a cafe (open 11am to 5pm Easter to October).
