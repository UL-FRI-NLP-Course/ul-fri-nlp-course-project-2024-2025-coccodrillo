St Anne's Church | Cork City, Ireland |  Shandon is dominated by the 1722 St Anne’s Church, aka the ‘Four-Faced Liar’ – so called because each of the tower’s four clocks used to tell a slightly different time. Wannabe campanologists can ring the bells on the 1st floor of the 1750 Italianate tower, and then continue up the 132 steps to the top for 360-degree views of the city.
