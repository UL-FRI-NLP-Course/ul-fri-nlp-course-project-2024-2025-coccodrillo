Elizabeth Fort | Cork City, Ireland |  Originally built in the 1620s, and serving as a garda (police) station from 1929 to 2013, this small star-shaped artillery fort once formed an important part of the city's defences. Newly opened to the public, it offers an insight into Cork's military history, and there are good views across the city from the ramparts. Guided tours (per person â‚¬3) at 1pm provide additional context.
