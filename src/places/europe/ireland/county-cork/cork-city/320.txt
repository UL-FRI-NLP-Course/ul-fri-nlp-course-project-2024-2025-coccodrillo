Radio Museum | Cork City, Ireland |  The National Radio Museum is part of the Cork City Gaol which, after its closure in 1923, housed a radio station from 1927 until the 1950s. The change of use is reflected in the museum where, alongside collections of beautiful old radios, you can hear the story of radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconiâ€™s conquest of the airwaves.
