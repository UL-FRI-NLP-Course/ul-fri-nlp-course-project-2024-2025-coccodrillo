Clock Gate Tower | County Cork, Ireland |  The curious Clock Gate straddles the middle of Youghal's main street. Built in 1777, it served as a town gate, clock tower and jail; several prisoners taken in the 1798 Rising were hanged from its windows. One-hour guided tours (tickets from the nearby tourist office) lead you through four floors of exhibits to a rooftop viewpoint while telling the tale of Youghal's colourful past.
