Jameson Experience | County Cork, Ireland |  Coachloads pour in to tour this restored 200-year-old distillery building. Exhibits and 75-minute tours (run between 10am and 4pm) explain the process of taking barley and creating whiskey (Jameson is today made in a modern factory in Cork). There's a well-stocked gift shop, and the Malt House Restaurant (open noon to 3pm) has live music on Sundays.
