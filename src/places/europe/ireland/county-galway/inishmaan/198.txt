Synge's Chair | Aran Islands, Ireland |  At the desolate western end of the island, Synge's Chair is a viewpoint at the edge of a sheer limestone cliff with the surf from Gregory's Sound booming below. The cliff ledge is often sheltered from the wind; do as Synge did and find a stone perch to take it all in. The formation is two minutes' walk from the end of the lane.
On the walk out to Synge's Chair, a sign points the way to a cloch√°n (circular stone building, shaped like an old-fashioned beehive, from the early Christian period), hidden behind a house and shed.
