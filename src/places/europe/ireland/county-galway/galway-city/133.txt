Fishery Watchtower | Galway City, Ireland |  Constructed in the 1850s, this butter-coloured Victorian tower was used to monitor fish stock levels (and poachers). Now restored, the unique trilevel building contains a tiny museum that gives an overview of Galway's salmon-fishing industry through displays including photos, along with fantastic views over the waterways.
