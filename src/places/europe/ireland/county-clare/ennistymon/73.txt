Cascades | County Clare, Ireland |  Best seen by walking through the arch by Byrne's Inn, Ennistimon's cascades are quite a sight after heavy rain when they surge, beer-brown foaming, and you risk getting drenched on windy days in the flying drizzle. Beyond the cascades, a pretty riverside walk takes you beyond the Falls Hotel.
