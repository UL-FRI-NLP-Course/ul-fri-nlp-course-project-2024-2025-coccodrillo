Clare Heritage Centre Interpretative Museum | The Burren, Ireland |  Many of the displays inside early-1700s St Catherine's Church cover the horrors of the Great Famine, which led to mass emigration. More than 200,000 people lived in Clare before the Famine; today the county's population remains nearly half that.
Across the street, the Clare Heritage & Genealogy Centre, which administers the museum, can help you trace your ancestors.
