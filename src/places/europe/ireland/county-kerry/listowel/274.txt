Kerry Writers' Museum | County Kerry, Ireland |  The Writers' Exhibition in this Georgian building celebrates Listowel's heritage of literary observers of Irish life. Rooms are devoted to local greats such as John B Keane and Bryan MacMahon, with simple, haunting tableaux narrating their lives, and recordings of them reading their work, a reflection of Ireland's tradition of storytelling. There's a cafe and a performance space where events are regularly staged in summer.
