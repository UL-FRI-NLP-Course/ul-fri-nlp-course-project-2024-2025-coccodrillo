Geokaun Mountain | Skellig Ring, Ireland |  The local landowner has transformed the island's highest point, Geokaun (266m), into a network of easy walking trails and viewpoints, with a breathtaking outlook over the Fogher Cliffs. It's possible to drive all the way to the top, so visitors with limited mobility don't miss out on the views. At quieter times the site is unstaffed, and entry is via an automatic barrier (payment with coins only).
