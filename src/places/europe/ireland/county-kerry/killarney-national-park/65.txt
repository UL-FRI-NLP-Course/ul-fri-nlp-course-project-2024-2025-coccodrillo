Muckross Abbey | Killarney National Park, Ireland |  Signposted 1.5km northeast of Muckross House, this well-preserved ruin (actually a friary, though everyone calls it an abbey) was founded in 1448 and burned by Cromwell's troops in 1652. There's a square-towered church and a small, atmospheric cloister with a giant yew tree in the centre (legend has it that the tree is as old as the abbey). In the chancel is the tomb of the McCarthy MÃ²r chieftains, and an elaborate 19th-century memorial to local philanthropist Lucy Gallwey.
