People's Park | Limerick City, Ireland |  This lovely wooded park in Pery Sq at the heart of Georgian Limerick is an excellent place for collapsing onto the grass with a chunky novel when the sun pops out. Check out the restored 19th-century red-and-white drinking fountain. The statue on the column in the middle of the park is of Thomas Spring Rice, a former MP for Limerick.
