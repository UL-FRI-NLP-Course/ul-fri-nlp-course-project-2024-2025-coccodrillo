St Mary's Cathedral | Limerick City, Ireland |  Limerick's ancient cathedral was founded in 1168 by Donal MÃ³r O'Brien, king of Munster. Parts of the 12th-century Romanesque western doorway, nave and aisles survive, and there are splendid 15th-century black-oak misericords (for supporting 'clerical posteriors') in the Jebb Chapel, unique examples of their kind in Ireland and each fabulously carved with creatures and mythical animals.
