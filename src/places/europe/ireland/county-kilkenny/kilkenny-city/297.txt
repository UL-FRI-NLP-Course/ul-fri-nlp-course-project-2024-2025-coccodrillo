Butler House Gardens | Kilkenny City, Ireland |  The beautiful Butler House gardens are home to an unusual water feature constructed from remnants of the British-built Nelson's Pillar, blown up by nationalists in Dublin's O'Connell St in 1966. Access is via a gate at the back of the courtyard behind the National Design & Craft Gallery. Access is restricted during weddings and other private events.
