Butler Gallery | Kilkenny City, Ireland |  The Butler Gallery is one of the countryâ€™s most important art galleries outside Dublin. Small exhibitions featuring the work of contemporary artists are held throughout the year. At the time of research, the gallery was housed in the basement of Kilkenny Castle (accessible without paying the castle's admission price). It's slated to move to new premises in Barrack Lane in 2020, with an on-site cafe.
