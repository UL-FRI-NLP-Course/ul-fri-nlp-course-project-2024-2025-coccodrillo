National Design & Craft Gallery | Kilkenny City, Ireland |  Contemporary Irish crafts are showcased at the imaginative National Design & Craft Gallery, set in former stables across the road from Kilkenny Castle, next to the shops of the Kilkenny Design Centre. Ceramics dominate, but exhibits often feature furniture, jewellery and weaving from the members of the Crafts Council of Ireland. Family days are held the second Saturday of every month, with a tour of the gallery and free hands-on workshops for children. Check the website for additional workshops and events.
