Gelin Tülü Şelasi View | Black Sea Coast, Türkiye |  At the eastern end of Ayder village is a popular viewpoint from which to look out across a very deep-cut valley to a long, vertical series of cascades that pours down the facing mountainside. It's an impressive sight but the experience can seem a slight anticlimax to those whose misleading tour description had suggested a visit to a 'waterfall' rather than the chance to admire one from afar.
