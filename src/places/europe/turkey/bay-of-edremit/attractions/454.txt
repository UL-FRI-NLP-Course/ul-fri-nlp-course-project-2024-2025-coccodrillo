Adatepe Olive-Oil Museum | İzmir & the North Aegean, Türkiye |  Housed in an old olive-oil factory, this unassuming but interesting museum explains the process of making olive oil and illustrates the product's many uses. There's a cafe downstairs, as well as an excellent shop selling every olive-oil product imaginable. Try the falafel wraps and the homemade kombucha (fermented tea).
