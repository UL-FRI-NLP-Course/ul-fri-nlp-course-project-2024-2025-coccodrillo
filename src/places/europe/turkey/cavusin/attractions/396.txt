Çavuşin Kilisesi | Cappadocia, Türkiye |  Just off the highway on the northern edge of Çavuşin you'll find this church, accessed via a steep and rickety iron stairway. Cappadocia's first post-iconoclastic church, it served as a pigeon house for many years and is home to some fine frescoes.It was closed due to ongoing restoration work in 2019 so check locally to make sure it's reopened before visiting.
