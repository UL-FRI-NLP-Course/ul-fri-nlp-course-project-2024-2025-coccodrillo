Kültür Parkı | Bursa, Türkiye |  With its fine lawns and flower beds, tea gardens, playgrounds and a lake where you can hire pedal boats, leafy Kültür Parkı is a good place for travelling families to let the kids run free after pounding Bursa's crowded streets. The Archaeology Museum is also inside the park grounds.
