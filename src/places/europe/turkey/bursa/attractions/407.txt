Turkish & Islamic Arts Museum | Bursa, Türkiye |  Housed in the former medrese (seminary) of the Yeşil Cami, this museum contains 14th- to 16th-century İznik ceramics, jewellery, embroidery, calligraphy, dervish artefacts and Karagöz puppets. It was closed for extensive restoration work when we were last in town, which was expected to be finished by 2021.
