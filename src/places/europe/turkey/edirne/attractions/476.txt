Kırkpınar Evi | Edirne, Türkiye |  A dusty shrine to the sport of oil wrestling, the museum in this 19th-century timber house features press clippings, photographs and a few naff mannequins dressed as wrestlers (ie, not wearing much at all). If it's not open, ask one of the waiters at the çay bahçesı in the front garden.
