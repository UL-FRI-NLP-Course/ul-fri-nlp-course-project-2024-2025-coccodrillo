Turasan Winery | Ürgüp, Türkiye |  The abundant sunshine and fertile volcanic soil of Cappadocia produce delicious sweet grapes, and several wineries carry on the Ottoman Greek winemaking tradition. You can sample some of the local produce here; there's a free tasting of two small samples (one red, one white) then a paid tasting of three larger ones.
