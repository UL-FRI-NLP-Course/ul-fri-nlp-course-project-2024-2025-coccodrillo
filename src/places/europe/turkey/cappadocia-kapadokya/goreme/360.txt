Haçlı Kilise | Göreme, Türkiye |  This church, entered via a rickety wooden staircase, has frescoes dating to the 9th century on its apse and a ceiling carved with a spectacular large cross.On the ridge, just below the rock cone that contains the church, is the charming Cross Church Cafe with its shaded terraces and valley views. It's the perfect pit stop when you're hiking; try the excellent orange and pomegranate juice.
