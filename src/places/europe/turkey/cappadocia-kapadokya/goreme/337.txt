Aynalı Kilise | Göreme, Türkiye |  From the Open-Air Museum entrance, a 1km walk uphill along Müze Caddesi brings you to the signposted trail leading down to the Aynalı Kilise. The main chapel is adorned with interesting red-ochre geometric decorations, but the real highlight here is shimmying through the network of narrow tunnels interconnecting a series of rooms within the rock face. The on-site guardian provides torches for visitors.
