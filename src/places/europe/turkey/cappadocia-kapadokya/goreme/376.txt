Rahibeler Monastery | Göreme, Türkiye |  Downhill from the Sandal Church, the cordoned-off Rahibeler Monastery was originally several storeys high. It's thought that this building served as a nunnery during the 11th century. All that remains is a large plain dining hall and, up some steps, a small chapel with unremarkable frescoes. Due to the instability of the rock cone, it can't be entered.
