Church of St Demetrius | South Aegean, Türkiye |  This 18th-century church, at the northern end of the village, is up the steps to the right as you enter Şirince along the Selçuk road. It served as a mosque after 1923 but is now abandoned and open to the elements. Have a look at what remains of its frescoed vaulted ceiling and choir loft, iconostasis and marble floor.
