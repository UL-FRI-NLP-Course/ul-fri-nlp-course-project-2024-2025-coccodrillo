Arasta Bazaar | Sultanahmet, Istanbul |  This historic arcade of shops was once part of the k√ºlliye (mosque complex) of the Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Camii). Mosques built by the great and powerful usually included numerous public-service institutions, including an arasta (row of shops) such as this, as well as hospitals, soup kitchens and schools. The arasta is now home to some of Sultanahmet's most alluring boutiques.
