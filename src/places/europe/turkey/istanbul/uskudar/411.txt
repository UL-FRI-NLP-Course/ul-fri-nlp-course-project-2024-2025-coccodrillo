Çinili Mosque | Istanbul, Türkiye |  This little mosque is fairly unprepossessing from the outside, but the interior is a totally different story. The walls are decorated with gorgeous İznik tiles, the bequest of Mahpeyker Kösem (1640), wife of Sultan Ahmet I and mother of sultans Murat IV and İbrahim I ('İbrahim the Crazy'). It's a 10-minute walk to get here from the Atik Valide Mosque.
