ARTER | Istanbul, Türkiye |  Opened to great fanfare in September 2019, the new home of the Koç Foundation's collection of contemporary art – one of the most impressive in Turkey – was designed by London-based Grimshaw Architects and is located 1km northwest of Taksim Sq, in the Dolapdere district. It incorporates exhibition spaces, a sculpture terrace, performance halls, a library, an arts bookstore and a cafe, and its exhibition program is sure to be as impressive as its six-floor building, which has a shimmering facade of glass-fibre mosaics.
Free shuttle buses run from the Taksim metro station and Pera Museum in Tepebaşı; check the website for details.
