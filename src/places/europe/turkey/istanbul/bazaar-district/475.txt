Tombs of Süleyman & Roxelana | Istanbul, Türkiye |  To the right (southeast) of the main entrance to the Süleymaniye mosque is its cemetery, home to the octagonal tombs of Süleyman and his wife Haseki Hürrem Sultan (Roxelana). The tilework surrounding the entrances to both is superb and the ivory-inlaid panels in Süleyman's tomb are quite lovely.
