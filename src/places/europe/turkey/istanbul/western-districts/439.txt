Sultan Reşad Türbesi | Istanbul, Türkiye |  Buried here is Mehmet V Reşâd (1844–1918), the Ottoman sultan who reigned during the First Balkan War and the entry of his empire into World War I. He died a few months before the end of the war, so didn't witness the demise of his empire, a melancholy legacy inherited by his brother Mehmet VI. The tomb is closed to the public.
