Zahire Pazarı | South Aegean, Türkiye |  This carefully restored market in the shadow of the Pazar Camı (Bazaar Mosque) features lazy cafes spilling across a leafy cloistered courtyard dotted with traditional craft shops; the city subsidises their rent to maintain traditions such as marbled paper (ebru), hand-woven items and intricate painted boxes. Even if you're not shopping, come for an atmospheric drink.
