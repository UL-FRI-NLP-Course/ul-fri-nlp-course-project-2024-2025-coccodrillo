Ortahisar Tarih Museum | Trabzon, TÃ¼rkiye |  A restored old house and backyard, perched on a fortress bastion above the Tabakhane Bridge, hosts a little museum that's all in Turkish but worth a five-minute peek for its collection of 20th-century Trabzon postcards and for old cine-footage taken by past visitors to the city.
