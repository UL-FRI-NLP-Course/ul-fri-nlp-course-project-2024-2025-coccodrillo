Ortahisar Fatih Büyük Camii | Trabzon, Türkiye |  Originally known by the rather breathless name of the 'Church of the Golden-Headed Virgin Mary', this mosque started out as a church, possibly built by the nephew of Emperor Constantine I. It was claimed for Islam by the Ottomans in 1461. Ionic columns incorporated into the northern entrance may have once belonged to a Roman temple.
