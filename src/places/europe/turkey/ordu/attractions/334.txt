Taşbaşı Kilesisi | Black Sea Coast, Türkiye |  Standing in a hilltop garden overlooking the sea, this hefty former stone building was built as a Greek church (1853) and is undergoing extensive long-term reconstruction. It's the most prominent landmark in the appealing old Greek quarter which climbs a steep rise above the coast, some 500m west of central Ordu.
This attractive neighbourhood's tumbledown houses are slowly being gentrified too, and a handful are now lovely boutique hotels.
