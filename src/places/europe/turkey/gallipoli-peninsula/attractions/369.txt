French War Memorial & Cemetery | Gallipoli Peninsula, TÃ¼rkiye |  The rarely visited French cemetery is extremely moving, with rows of metal crosses and five white-concrete ossuaries each containing the bones of 3000 soldiers. French troops, including a regiment of Africans, successfully attacked Kumkale on the Asian shore in March 1915, then re-embarked and landed in support of their British comrades-in-arms at Cape Helles, where they were virtually wiped out.
