Stadium | Ephesus, TÃ¼rkiye |  Outside the Lower Gate, the stadium dates from the 2nd century AD. The Byzantines removed most of its finely cut stones to build the fortress and the Basilica of St John on Ayasuluk Hill. This 'quarrying' of precut building stone from older, often earthquake-ruined structures was a constant feature of Ephesian history. The stadium is not open to the public.
