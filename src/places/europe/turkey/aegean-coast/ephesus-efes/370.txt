Baths of Varius | Ephesus, TÃ¼rkiye |  Baths were situated at the main entrances to ancient cities so that visitors could be disinfected and wash before entering. These 2nd-century ones stand at the entrance to Upper Ephesus beside the Magnesian Gate erected under Emperor Vespasian in the 1st century AD. Greco-Roman baths also served a social function as a meeting and massage destination. This is one of four bath complexes at Ephesus.
