Roman Theatre | Pamukkale, TÃ¼rkiye |  The Roman theatre is the highlight of Hierapolis, dramatically sitting uphill from the site and overlooking the ruins and mountains beyond. The stage area, with its decorative panels, and 12,000-spectator capacity seating tiers have been carefully restored. It was built in two stages by the emperors Hadrian and Septimius Severus.
