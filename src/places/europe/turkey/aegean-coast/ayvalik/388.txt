Taksiyarhis Memorial Museum | Ayvalık, Türkiye |  This erstwhile Greek Orthodox cathedral, built in 1844 but never used as a place of worship, was completely renovated in 2013 and positively shimmers in the midday sun. Note the catedra (bishop’s seat) decorated with pelicans and a crown, the wonderful pulpit and the 18th-century icons in the apse. The cathedral is huge, with three aisles and a free-standing belfry.
