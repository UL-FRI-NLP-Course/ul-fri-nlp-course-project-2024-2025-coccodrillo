Ortahisar Castle | Cappadocia, TÃ¼rkiye |  Slap in the middle of Ortahisar's town centre, this 18m-high rock outcrop was used as a fortress in Byzantine times. It was reopened after a restoration project stabilised the crumbling edifice, and you can now climb the precarious metal ladders and stairways to the viewing terrace halfway up and admire the glorious view. Head up in the late afternoon for the best photography light.
Wear decent walking shoes; one of the top ladders is exceptionally steep.
