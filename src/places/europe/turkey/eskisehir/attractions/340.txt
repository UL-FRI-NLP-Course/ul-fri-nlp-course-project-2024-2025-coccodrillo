Eskişehir Science & Experiment Centre | Eskişehir, Türkiye |  If you're travelling with kids, this colourful complex makes for an entertaining break from all the historical ruins. Like a cross between a science centre and a fairground, its interactive exhibits and hands-on experiments such as the counterweighted car, fountain-triggering xylophone and infinity bridge illustrate the many forces of nature and will get visitors involved, pulling, pushing and pedalling. Free guided tours are available.
