Büyük Çakıl Plajı | Kaş, Türkiye |  For swimming, head for 'Big Pebble Beach', a relatively clean beach 1.5km southeast of Kaș town centre. Although it's largely pebble-based, there's a few metres of sand at one end. There are shaded cafes for refreshments, which also rent out sunloungers and sunshades.
