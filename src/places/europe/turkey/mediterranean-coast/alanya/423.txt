Cleopatra's Beach | Alanya, TÃ¼rkiye |  Sandy and quite secluded in low season, and with fine views of the fortress, Cleopatra's Beach is the city's best. Alanya's main beaches are also decent enough, although east of the centre they're fronted by a busy main road. The teleferik will deposit you practically on Cleopatra's Beach from the castle.
