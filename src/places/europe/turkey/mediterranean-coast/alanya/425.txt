Armoury | Alanya, TÃ¼rkiye |  This large tower would have served as a coastal watchtower and arsenal during the Seljuk era. If you're game you can follow the walls from here towards the East Bastion, then climb them as they scale the seaward cliff towards the castle, with wonderful views on the way. Be warned, though: they are crumbling, very steep and not exactly safe.
