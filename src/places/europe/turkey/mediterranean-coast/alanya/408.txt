Ömürlü Kemal Atli Cultural Centre | Alanya, Türkiye |  This carefully prepared ethnographic museum displays life as it would have been for Ottoman Turks in Alanya in the 19th century, over two floors. Sometimes volunteer silk spinners work the loom in the handicraft centre next door, which is fascinating to watch. Check out the views from the delightful balcony but don the plastic shoe slippers provided first.
