Theatre | Side, TÃ¼rkiye |  Built in the 2nd century AD, Side's spectacular theatre could seat up to 20,000 spectators and rivals the nearby theatre of Aspendos for sheer drama. Look at the wall of the skene (stage building) for reliefs of figures and faces, including those of Comedy and Tragedy. During the town's September festival it's the venue for performances.
