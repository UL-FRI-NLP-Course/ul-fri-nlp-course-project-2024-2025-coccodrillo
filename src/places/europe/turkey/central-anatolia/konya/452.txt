Sahib-i Ata Külliyesi | Konya, Türkiye |  Behind its requisite grand entrance with built-in minaret is the Sahib-i Ata Külliyesi, originally constructed during the reign of Alaaddin Keykavus. Destroyed by fire in 1871, it was rebuilt in 13th-century style. The mihrab (niche indicating the direction of Mecca) is a fine example of blue Seljuk tile work.
