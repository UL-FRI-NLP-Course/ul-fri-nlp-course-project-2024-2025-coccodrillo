Archaeological Museum | Konya, Türkiye |  The rather dusty Archaeological Museum houses interesting finds from Çatalhöyük, including the skeleton of a baby girl, clutching jewellery made of stone and bone, and a geometric wall painting discovered on-site in 2011 and transplanted to the museum in 2016. Other artefacts range across the millennia, from Chalcolithic terracotta jars to Hittite hieroglyphs, an Assyrian oil lamp shaped like a bunch of grapes, and bronze and stone Roman sarcophagi, one narrating the labours of Hercules in high-relief carvings.
There's an official ticket price but last time we were here, they were letting visitors in for free.
