Kocatepe Cami | Ankara, TÃ¼rkiye |  The huge outline of Kocatepe Cami is the symbol of Ankara. It is one of the world's largest mosques but it is also a modern addition, built between 1967 and 1987.
In the basement of the mosque is a supermarket, which says much about the priorities of modern Turkey.
