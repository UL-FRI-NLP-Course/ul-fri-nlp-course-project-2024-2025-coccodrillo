Ethnography Museum | Ankara, Türkiye |  Housed inside the building (built 1927) that served as Atatürk's mausoleum until the Anıt Kabir was built, the Ethnography Museum has a small but well-curated collection that showcases Turkey's artistic heritage. In the entrance hall, Atatürk's mausoleum space is preserved with photographs of his funeral displayed on the walls.The left-hand hall leading off the entrance contains Seljuk ceramics, Anatolian jewellery and a particularly beautiful collection of Ottoman woodwork including intricately carved minbars (pulpits in a mosque) and mosque doors.
The right-hand hall exhibits daily-life dioramas complete with mannequins.
