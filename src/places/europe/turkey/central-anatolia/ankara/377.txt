Roman Baths | Ankara, TÃ¼rkiye |  At the sprawling 3rd-century Roman Baths ruins, the layout is still clearly visible; look for the standard Roman apoditerium (dressing room), frigidarium (cold room), tepidarium (warm room) and caldarium (hot room). A Byzantine tomb and Phrygian remains have also been found here.
Make sure you wear sturdy shoes as the site is very overgrown in parts.
