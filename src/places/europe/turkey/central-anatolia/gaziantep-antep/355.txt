Hasan Süzer Ethnography Museum | Gaziantep, Türkiye |  This 200-year-old stone house features a central hayat (courtyard) patterned with light and dark stones. Rooms on the ground floor were for service; those on the 1st floor made up the selamlık (quarters for male family members and their visitors); and those on the 2nd floor were the haremlik (for female family members and their visitors). It's currently closed due to extensive renovation work.
