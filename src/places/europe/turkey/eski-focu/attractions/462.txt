Beşkapılar | İzmir & the North Aegean, Türkiye |  If you head west past the outdoor sanctuary of Cybele, you’ll come to the city walls and the partially rebuilt Beşkapılar, effectively the docking area of a castle, built by the Byzantines, repaired by the Genoese and the Ottomans in 1539, and clearly much restored since. Sadly, it's often filled with rubbish.
