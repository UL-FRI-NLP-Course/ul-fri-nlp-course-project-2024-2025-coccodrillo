Milančev Buk | Bosnia & Hercegovina, Europe |  Collectively, this group of cascades tumbles down a vertical height of more than 50m, with a wide arc of rivulets pouring into a series of pools surrounded by lush, green foliage. The main viewpoint is a minute's walk from the ticket gate, 1.3km off the Bihać–Dravar Rd in Martin Brod village. Make sure you check out the view from the red footbridge near the car park, too.
Entry times reflect when the ticket booth is staffed…outside hours you can just walk in.
