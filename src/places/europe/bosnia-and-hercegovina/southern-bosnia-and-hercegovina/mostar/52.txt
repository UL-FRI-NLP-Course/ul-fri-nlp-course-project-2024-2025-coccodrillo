Old Bridge Museum | Mostar, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  This somewhat sparse museum inhabits one of the defensive towers that guard either side of Stari Most. Visits start by climbing the five storeys for partial views and interesting but limited displays about the bridge's context and construction. You then descend and walk through the structure's archaeological bowels, where a lengthy video (in Bosnian) gives a thorough account of the bridge's reconstruction.
