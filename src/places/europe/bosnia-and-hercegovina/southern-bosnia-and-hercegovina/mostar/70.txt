Ljubljanska Banka Tower | Mostar, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Of several ruined structures remaining around Å panski trg, perhaps the most disturbing is the triangular multistorey skeleton of what was once a bank building, infamously used during the 1990s conflict as a snipers' vantage point. Access is blocked, but that hasn't deterred some imaginative graffiti artists.
