Crooked Bridge | Mostar, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Built around 1558, this pint-sized bridge crosses the tiny Radobolja River amid a layered series of picturesque millhouse restaurants. The original bridge, weakened by wartime assaults, was washed away by floods on New Year's Eve 1999; it was rebuilt in 2002.
