War Childhood Museum | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  This affecting museum had its genesis in a 2013 book edited by Jasminko HaliloviÄ‡, in which he asked a simple question of survivors of the Sarajevo siege: 'What was a war childhood for you?' Of the hundreds of replies received, 50 short written testimonies are presented here, each illustrated by personal effects donated by the writer, such as diaries, drawings, toys and ballet slippers. It's a lighter, less gore-filled approach to the conflict than you'll find elsewhere, but equally devastating.
