Kovači Graveyard | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Overloaded with the white gravestones of those killed during the 1990s conflict, this steeply contoured cemetery is the final resting place of the country's first president, Alija Izetbegović. His grave is marked by a modest obelisk shaded by an open-sided dome that glows golden when lit at night.
