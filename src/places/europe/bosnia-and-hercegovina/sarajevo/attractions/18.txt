History Museum of BiH | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Somewhat misleadingly named, this small yet engrossing museum occupies a striking, still partly war-damaged 1960s socialist-modernist building originally dubbed the Museum of the Revolution. It regularly hosts high-profile international exhibitions but the main attraction is the permanent Surrounded Sarajevo display, which charts local people's life-and-death battles for survival between 1992 and 1995. Alongside some heartbreaking photographs are personal effects such as self-made lamps, examples of food aid, stacks of Monopoly-style 1990s dinars and a makeshift siege-time 'home'.
Also interesting is the collection of 1996â€“2011 before-and-after Sarajevo images in the hallway. Directly behind the building, the tongue-in-cheek Tito bar is a museum in its own right.
