White Fortress | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Although it's thought to have had its origins in the Middle Ages, this bastion was substantially strengthened and incorporated into the walls built to protect the neighbourhood of Vratnik in the 1720s. It's now a graffiti-covered and rubbish-strewn shell, but it offers great views along the river and over the entire city.
