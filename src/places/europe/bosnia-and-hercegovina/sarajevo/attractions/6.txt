Sarajevo Cable Car | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Reopened in 2018 after being destroyed during the war, Sarajevo's cable car once again shuttles people on a nine-minute ride, climbing 500m to a viewpoint 1164m up on Mt TrebeviÄ‡. From here it's a short walk to the wreck of the Olympic bobsled track, seemingly held together by layers of graffiti.
