Emperor's Mosque | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Across the river from the old city, this large stone mosque was built in 1565 to replace Sarajevo's very first mosque, a wooden structure built in 1457 shortly after the Ottoman conquest. Major works in 2014â€“15 have also led to the reconstruction of the 1462 Isa-Bey Hamam next door, now incorporating a hotel.
