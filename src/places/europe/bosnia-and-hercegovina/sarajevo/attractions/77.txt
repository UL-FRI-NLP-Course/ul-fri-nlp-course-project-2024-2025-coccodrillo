Museum of Crimes Against Humanity & Genocide 1992â€“1995 | Sarajevo, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  Nothing is sugar-coated in this confronting museum covering the many atrocities that took place throughout Bosnia during the 1990s war. Video footage combined with photographs, artefacts and personal testimonies illustrates the horror and brutality of the times. We wouldn't recommend bringing younger children.
