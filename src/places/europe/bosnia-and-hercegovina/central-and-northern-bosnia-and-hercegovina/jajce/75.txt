Catacombs | Bosnia & Hercegovina, Europe |  Built around 1400 AD for the aristocratic HrvatniÄ‡ family, this two-level crypt is small and roughly hewn but artfully half-lit and notable for the boldly sculpted cross, sun and crescent moon motifs (downstairs), a rare surviving memorial to the independent Bosnian Church. Tito is said to have hidden here during 1943.
