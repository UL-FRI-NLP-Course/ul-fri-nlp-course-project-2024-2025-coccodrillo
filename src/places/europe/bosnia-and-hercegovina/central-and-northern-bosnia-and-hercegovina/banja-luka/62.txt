Kastel Fortress | Banja Luka, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  The chunky walls of this large, squat riverside fortress enclose mainly unremarkable parkland. It's thought there's been a fort here since Neolithic and Roman times, but Kastel's current look is largely 16th century. One stone barracks has been converted into an art gallery and there's an atmospheric restaurant built into the ramparts.
