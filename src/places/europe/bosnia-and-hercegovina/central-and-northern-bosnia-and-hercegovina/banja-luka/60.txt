Museum of Republika Srpska | Banja Luka, Bosnia & Hercegovina |  This large museum walks visitors through local history, from archaeological relics to a graphic display on the horrors of the Usta≈°e concentration camps of WWII, which is a major culminating focus. That it ends abruptly with the terrible suffering of the Bosnian Serbs during WWII is perhaps illustrative of the fear underlying the ethnic cleansing of the 1990s, coverage of which is glaringly absent.
