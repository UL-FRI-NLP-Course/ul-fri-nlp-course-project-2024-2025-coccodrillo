Vidova Gora | Brač Island, Croatia |  At 778m, Vidova Gora is the highest point on the Adriatic Islands and the view from the top is astounding. From here the entire island of Hvar is spread out like a map, with Vis and the mountains of the Pelješac Peninsula and Biokovo filling the horizon. It's easily reached by a good sealed road through a pine forest (look for the turnoff southeast of Nerežišća) or sweat your way up from Bol on foot (two hours) or by mountain bike.
