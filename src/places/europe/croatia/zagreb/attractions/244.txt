Technical Museum Nikola Tesla | Zagreb, Croatia |  Science fans and kids will enjoy the motley collection here, which segues from steam-engine locomotives to scale models of satellites with a replica of a mine and exhibits on agriculture, geology, energy and transport along the way. The planetarium (additional entry 15KN) is great for older kids.
