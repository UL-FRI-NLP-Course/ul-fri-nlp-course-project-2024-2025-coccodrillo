St Michael's Fortress | Šibenik, Croatia |  Clamber up to the battlements of this large medieval fort for magnificent views – particularly impressive at sunset – over Šibenik, the Krk River and the Adriatic islands. Parts of the fortress date to the 13th century, but the surviving shell has been shored up with a polished-concrete understructure and converted into a summer stage.
