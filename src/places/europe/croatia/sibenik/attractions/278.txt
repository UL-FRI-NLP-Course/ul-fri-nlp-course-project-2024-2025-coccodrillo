St John's Church | Å ibenik, Croatia |  Dating from the end of the 15th century, this church is a fine example of Gothic-Renaissance architecture, but sadly the interior has mouldering paintwork and a rather unloved feel. It's officially closed to visitors, but you can peek in when the door is open.
