Issa Archaeological Museum | Vis Island, Croatia |  Housed in a 19th-century Austrian fortress, this small museum has the largest collection of Hellenistic artefacts in Croatia, including ancient Greek pottery, jewellery and sculpture. The highlight is an exquisite 4th-century-BC bronze head of the goddess Artemis. A room on the other side of the courtyard displays relics retrieved from shipwrecks.
