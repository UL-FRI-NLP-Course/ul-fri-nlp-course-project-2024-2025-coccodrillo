Roški Slap | Krka National Park, Croatia |  Beginning with shallow steps and continuing in a series of branches and islets to become 23m-high cascades, this 650m-long stretch is a flamboyantly pretty part of the Krka River. On the eastern side you can visit the water mills that used to grind wheat. Boats leave from Skradinski Buk waterfall (adult/child 140/95KN, 3½ hours).
