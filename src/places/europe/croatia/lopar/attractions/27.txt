Paradise Beach | Rab Island, Croatia |  One of Croatia's best beaches, this sickle of fine sand hems Lopar's southern flank and is the biggest attraction in these parts. Backed by all sorts of attractions, from minigolf to ice-cream parlours, this is the ideal spot for a family holiday. The beach hardly shelves as it goes out into the warm Adriatic, and a small offshore island makes for a great swimming or kayaking destination.
