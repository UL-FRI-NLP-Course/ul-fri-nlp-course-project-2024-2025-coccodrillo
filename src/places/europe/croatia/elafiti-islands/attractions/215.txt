Koločep | Elafiti Islands, Croatia |  The nearest of the Elafitis to Dubrovnik, this sweet island is inhabited by a mere 163 people and is covered in centuries-old pine forests, olive groves and orchards filled with orange and lemon trees. A sandy beach stretches out from the main village past a large resort-style hotel. Continue around the corner and you'll reach a pretty but rocky nudist area.
