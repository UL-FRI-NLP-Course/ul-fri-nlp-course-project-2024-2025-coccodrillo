Ɖorđić-Mayneri Park | Elafiti Islands, Croatia |  A cool retreat on a sunny day, this gorgeous little park was laid out in the late 19th-century by the great-granddaughter of Dubrovnik's last rector. The shade is provided by botanical species from around the world, including North African date palms, North American magnolias and Tasmanian eucalyptus trees.
