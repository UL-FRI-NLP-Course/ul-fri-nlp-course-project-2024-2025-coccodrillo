Veliki Revelin Tower | Korčula Island, Croatia |  The main entrance to the old city is through the southern land gate at the base of this tower. Built in the 14th century and later extended, this fortification is adorned with coats of arms of the Venetian doges and Korčulan governors. There was originally a wooden drawbridge here, but it was replaced in the 18th century by the wide stone steps that give a sense of grandeur to the entrance.
