Marco Polo House | Korƒçula Island, Croatia |  Located in the skinny tower of the house that is purported to have been Marco Polo's, this tiny museum has a few displays, but perhaps the real appeal of the building is its views. Climb the very steep steps for a vista over the rooftops to the sea. Note that the access staircase can be a challenge, so those with dodgy knees or young children may decide to skip it.
