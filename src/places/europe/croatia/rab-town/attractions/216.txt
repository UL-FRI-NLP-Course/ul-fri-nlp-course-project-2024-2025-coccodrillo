Holy Cross Church | Rab Island, Croatia |  This 13th-century church takes its present name from a crucifix upon which, in 1556, the image of Christ was said to have wept due to the immoral conduct of the people of Rab. Sadly, the miraculous cross was lost in the early 20th century. Today the church is a venue for summer concerts during Rab Musical Evenings.
