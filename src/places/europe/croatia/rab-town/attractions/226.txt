Viewpoint | Rab Island, Croatia |  For a great view over Rab's rooftops, including all four bell towers, head to the northwesternmost corner of the old town and look for a small courtyard containing fragments of old monuments. Stone stairs lead up from here on to the walls and a lookout â€“ take care with children, as the drops are steep and the railings past their best.
