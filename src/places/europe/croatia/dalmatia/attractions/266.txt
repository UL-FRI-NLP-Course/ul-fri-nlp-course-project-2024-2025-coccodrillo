Uljara Nadin | Northern Dalmatia, Croatia |  This fine place offers olive-oil tasting (including advice on how to tell the difference between good and bad olive oil), a tour of its production processes, and a shop where you can purchase the real thing. It's a wonderful introduction to what is something of a Croatian obsession.
