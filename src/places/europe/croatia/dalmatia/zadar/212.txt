Land Gate | Zadar, Croatia |  The most elaborate of the city gates also has the prettiest setting, facing a sheltered little marina. Dating from 1543, it has Renaissance-style decorations including St Chrysogonus (Zadar's patron saint) on horseback and the Venetian winged lion. The gate is still used by traffic and was clearly meant to impress those entering â€“ the reverse side is decidedly plain.
