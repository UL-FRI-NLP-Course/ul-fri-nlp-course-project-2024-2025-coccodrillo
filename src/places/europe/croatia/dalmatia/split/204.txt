Meštrović Crikvene-Kaštilac | Split, Croatia |  This 16th-century fortified home, set in an olive grove near the Meštrović Gallery, was bought by Ivan Meštrović in 1939 and restored to house his powerful Life of Christ cycle of wood reliefs in the chapel. At the centre of the complex, a large stone sculpture entitled Author of the Apocalypse looks over a lovely quadrangle.
