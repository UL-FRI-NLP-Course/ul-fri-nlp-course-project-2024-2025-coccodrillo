Split Ethnographic Museum | Split, Croatia |  This mildly interesting museum occupies a former convent built within what was originally the emperor's bed chambers. Downstairs are temporary exhibitions, while elsewhere there's a collection of traditional costumes, jewellery, lace, weapons, toys and tools. Make sure you climb the reconstructed Roman staircase that leads to the Renaissance terrace encircling the top of the vestibule; the views are reason enough to visit the museum.
