Museum of Senses | Split, Croatia |  This museum provides a workout for your senses. Wander through the museumâ€™s five rooms, each of which teases your vision, hearing, smell, touch and balance; bump into your own image in the labyrinth of mirrors, smell unique scents of local winds and second-guess your balance by walking in a vortex.
Fun for all generations, the museum has a small gift shop with entertaining games and cool knick-knacks.
