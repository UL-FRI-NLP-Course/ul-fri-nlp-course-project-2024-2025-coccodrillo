Bačvice | Split, Croatia |  Sandy Bačvice is Split's most popular beach. There's a lot of concrete and it's perpetually crowded, but it offers a good taste of everyday Split life. Locals come here during the day to swim, sunbathe and drink coffee; a younger crowd returns in the evening for the bars and clubs. There are showers and changing rooms at both ends of the beach.
