Episcopal Museum | Hvar Town, Croatia |  Adjoining the cathedral, this treasury houses silver vessels, embroidered liturgical robes, numerous Madonnas, a 13th-century icon, an elaborately carved sarcophagus and, intriguingly, a stamp collection. A highlight is a 15th-century golden chalice that was a gift from the last king of Bosnia.
