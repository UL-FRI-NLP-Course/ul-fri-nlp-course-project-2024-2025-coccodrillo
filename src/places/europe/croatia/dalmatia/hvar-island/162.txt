St Stephen's Cathedral | Hvar Town, Croatia |  Providing a grand backdrop to the main square, this baroque cathedral was built in the 16th and 17th centuries at the height of the Dalmatian Renaissance to replace a cathedral destroyed by the Turks. Parts of the older building include stone reliefs of saints near the rear of the nave and carved 15th-century choir stalls. The building's most distinctive feature is its tall, rectangular bell tower, which sprouts an additional window at each level, giving it an oddly top-heavy appearance.
