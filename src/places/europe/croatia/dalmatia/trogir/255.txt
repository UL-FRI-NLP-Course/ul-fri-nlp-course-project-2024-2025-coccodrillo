Sacred Art Museum | Trogir, Croatia |  Highlights of this small museum include illuminated manuscripts; a large painting of St Jerome and St John the Baptist by Bellini; an almost-life-size, brightly painted Crucifix with Triumphant Christ; and the darkly lit fragments of a 13th-century icon that once adorned the cathedral's altar.
