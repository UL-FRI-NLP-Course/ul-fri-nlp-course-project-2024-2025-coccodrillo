Grand Cipiko Palace | Trogir, Croatia |  This palatial house, opposite the cathedral, was home to a prominent family during the 15th century. It's not open to the public, but you can stop to admire the intricately carved Gothic triforium encasing the windows on the facade, the work of Andrija Ale≈°i.
