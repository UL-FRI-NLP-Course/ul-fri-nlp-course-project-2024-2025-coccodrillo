Marmont's Gloriette | Trogir, Croatia |  Right at the western tip of Trogir island, this elegant gazebo was built by the French during the Napoleonic occupation of Dalmatia. At the time it jutted out into a marshy lagoon and Marshal Marmont used to sit within the circle of columns, surrounded by water, and play cards.
