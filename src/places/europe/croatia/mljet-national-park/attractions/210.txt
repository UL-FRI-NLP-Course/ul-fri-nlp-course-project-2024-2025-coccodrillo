Roman Palace | Mljet Island, Croatia |  It's hard to miss this impressive structure on the Polače waterfront; it's so large that the road now passes through the centre of it. Built around the 5th century, this palatial residence has a rectangular floor plan and towers on the front corners separated by a pier. Other ancient ruins scattered around the town include a late Antiquity fort and an early Christian church.
