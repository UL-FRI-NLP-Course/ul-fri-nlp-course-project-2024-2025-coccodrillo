Grisia | Rovinj, Croatia |  Lined with galleries and souvenir stores, this cobbled street leads uphill through the old town to St Euphemia. Windows, balconies, portals and squares are a pleasant confusion of styles â€“ Gothic, Renaissance, baroque and neoclassical. Notice the unique fumaioli (exterior chimneys), built during the population boom when entire families lived in a single room with a fireplace.
