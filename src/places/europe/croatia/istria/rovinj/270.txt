Balbi Arch | Rovinj, Croatia |  This elaborate arch was built in 1679 as the main town gate. The top of the arch is ornamented with a Turkish head on the outside and a Venetian head on the inside. The winged lion at the top is a symbol of Venice, although this one is unusual in that it has visible genitalia.
