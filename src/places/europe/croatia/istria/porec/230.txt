Sveti Nikola | Poreč, Croatia |  The island of Sveti Nikola lies just short of 500m south of the peninsula. From May to October small passenger boats make the crossing from the wharf on Maršala Tita. Once there, pebble and concrete beaches, rocky breakwaters, shady pine forests and great views of the town across the way await.
