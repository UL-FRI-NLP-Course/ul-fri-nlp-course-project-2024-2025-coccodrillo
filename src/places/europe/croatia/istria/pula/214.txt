Zerostrasse | Pula, Croatia |  This underground system of tunnels was built before and during WWI to shelter the city's population and serve as storage for ammunition. Now you can walk through several of its branches, which all lead to the middle where there's a photo exhibition on early aviation in Pula. There are three entrances, the easiest of which to find is by the taxi stand on Giardini.
