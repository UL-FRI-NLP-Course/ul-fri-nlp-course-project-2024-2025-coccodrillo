Mir Lake | Northern Dalmatia, Croatia |  Saltwater Mir Lake is fed by underground channels that run through limestone to the sea; it's home to an endemic species of eel. The lake, which is clear but has a muddy bottom, is surrounded by pine forests and its water is much warmer than the sea. Like most mud in unusual places, itâ€™s supposed to be very good for your skin.
