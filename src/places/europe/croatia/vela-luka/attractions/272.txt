Ošjak | Korčula Island, Croatia |  The tiny uninhabited island of Ošjak sits within Vela Luka harbour, only 15 minutes by taxi boat from the town. Paths lead through the pine forest to rocky coves where you can swim in relative seclusion. Bring everything you need with you, as there's nothing on the island.
