Orlando Column | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  Luža Sq once served as a marketplace, and this stone column – carved in 1417 and featuring the image of a medieval knight – used to be the spot where edicts, festivities and public verdicts were announced. The knight's forearm (51.2cm) was the official linear measure of the Republic – the ell of Dubrovnik.
