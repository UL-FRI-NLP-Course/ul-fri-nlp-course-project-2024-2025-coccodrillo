Ploče Gate | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  Less ornamented than the Pile Gate at the other side of town, Dubrovnik's eastern entrance is approached by a stone bridge followed by a wooden drawbridge, historically lifted at sunset and opened at sunrise. Pass the outer gate and Fort Revelin to find the statue of St Blaise with the city in his hands installed above the inner gate.
