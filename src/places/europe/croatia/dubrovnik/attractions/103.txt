Archaeological Museum | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  The museum presents two exhibitions, one on the archaeological research of Fort Revelin and its foundry, and the other on early medieval sculpture. Among the displayed fragments of stone, there are some good examples of medieval plait-work (pleter) â€“ psychedelic squiggles somewhat similar to those associated with Celtic art.
