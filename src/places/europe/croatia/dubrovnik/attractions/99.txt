Dr Franjo Tuđman Bridge | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  When it opened in 2002 this 518m-long lopsided cable-stayed bridge cut the drive west from Dubrovnik by 20 minutes. Park at the lot on the far side of the bridge to enjoy bird’s-eye views of Gruž Harbour and the Elafiti archipelago. It's particularly spectacular at sunset. For added thrills, book a bungee jump.
