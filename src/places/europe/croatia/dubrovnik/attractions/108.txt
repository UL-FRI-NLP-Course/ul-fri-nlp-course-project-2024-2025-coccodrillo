Marin Držić House | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  Educational but not terribly interesting (unless you're a fan of 16th-century Croatian theatre), this small museum is devoted to Marin Držić (c 1508–67), Dubrovnik's famous priest-playwright. The museum houses manuscripts and editions of his plays, and one room has been set up to replicate his original cell.
