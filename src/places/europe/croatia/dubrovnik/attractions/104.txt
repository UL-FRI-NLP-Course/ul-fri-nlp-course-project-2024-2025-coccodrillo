Gradac Park | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  If the old town gets too busy or too hot, this little hidden park provides shady seclusion. There's rarely more than a handful of locals here, along with the odd intrepid Game of Thrones fan seeking the site of The Purple Wedding. Relax, read a book and take in the views of the old town, Fort Lawrence and Danƒçe beach below.
