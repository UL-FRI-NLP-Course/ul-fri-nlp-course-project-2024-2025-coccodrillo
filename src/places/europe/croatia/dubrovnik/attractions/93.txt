St Blaise’s Church | Dubrovnik, Croatia |  Dedicated to the city's patron saint, this exceptionally beautiful church was built in 1715 in the ornate baroque style. The interior is notable for its marble altars and a 15th-century silver gilt statue of St Blaise (within the high altar), who is holding a scale model of pre-earthquake Dubrovnik. Note also the stained-glass windows designed by local artist Ivo Dulčić in 1971.
