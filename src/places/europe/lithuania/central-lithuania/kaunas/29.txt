Choral Synagogue | Kaunas, Lithuania |  Built in 1871, the only functioning synagogue of those that survived since 1941, and one of the few remnants of Kaunas' once-strong Jewish community, this is a remarkable dark-wood and gold bimah. Outside there's a memorial to 1600 children killed at the Ninth Fort. It's best to call ahead if you wish to visit.
