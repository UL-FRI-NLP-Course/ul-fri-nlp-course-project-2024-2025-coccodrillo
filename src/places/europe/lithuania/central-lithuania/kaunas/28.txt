Kiemo Galerija | Kaunas, Lithuania |  Artist Vytenis Jakas moved into this courtyard over a decade ago and turned it into an ever-evolving art project, creating murals and transferring onto walls the photos of Jewish families that lived here before WWII. The 'Stick Your Memory' wall encourages you to join in and contribute a sentimental knick-knack to the chaotic yet joyful collage.
