Trakai Castle | Lithuania, Europe |  Stepping across the wooden walkway to Trakai's Gothic castle is like tripping into a fairy tale. The castle is estimated to date from around 1400, when Grand Duke Vytautas needed stronger defences than the peninsula castle afforded. Arranged between its coral-coloured brick towers, the excellent Trakai History Museum conveys the flavour of past eras: chainmail, medieval weapons, 19th-century embroidery and glassware, plus talking knights, projected onto the stone walls.In summer the courtyard is a magical stage for concerts and plays.
Archery and shooting ranges offer the chance to learn how you'd have fared as a castle defender.The castle's prominence as a holy site is reflected in its collection of religious art.
