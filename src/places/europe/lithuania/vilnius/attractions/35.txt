Gates of Dawn | Vilnius, Lithuania |  The southern border of Old Town is marked by the last standing of five 16th-century portals that were once built into the city walls. A suitably grand way to enter Old Town, the focal point of the Gates of Dawn is the Chapel of Mary the Mother of Mercy, housing the 'Vilnius Madonna'. Framed in silver, this 17th-century painting of the Virgin Mary attracts pilgrims from across Europe.
