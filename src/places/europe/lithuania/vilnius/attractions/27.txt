MO Museum | Vilnius, Lithuania |  Opened in October 2018, this assemblage of contemporary Lithuanian art and photography is the country's first private museum. An orderly union of sharp angles, polished glass and white plaster, the ultramodern gallery was designed by visionary Daniel Libeskind, the architect behind Berlin's Jewish Museum. Around 5000 20th-century artworks are assembled within, freshened by rotating exhibitions and occasional cultural events.
