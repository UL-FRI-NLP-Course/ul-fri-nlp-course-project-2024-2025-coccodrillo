Three Crosses | Vilnius, Lithuania |  Crosses were first erected in the 17th century, in memory of a group of monks martyred by pagans three centuries earlier. The current crosses replace three bulldozed by the Soviets; their twisted remains can be seen below the current set. Walk up the hill from T Kosciuskos gatvÄ—, and enjoy fabulous views of the city, particularly good here at sunset.
