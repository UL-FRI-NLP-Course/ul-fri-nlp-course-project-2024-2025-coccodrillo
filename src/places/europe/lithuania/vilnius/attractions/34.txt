St Michael the Archangel Church | Vilnius, Lithuania |  This grand early-17th-century chuch, built by the Sapiega family, now houses a wonderful museum of sacral art. The building itself, with its single Gothic nave, coloured-marble high altar and alabaster statuary, is a rare example of late-Renaissance architecture in Vilnius. The exhibition includes religious art, liturgical vessels and rare manuscripts, plus a precious monstrance and reliquaries from Vilnius Cathedral.
