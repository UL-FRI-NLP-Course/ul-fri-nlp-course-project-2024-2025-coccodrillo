Rinkuškiai Brewery | Lithuania, Europe |  The pride and joy of the region brews over two dozen beers, including the Port of Discovery and Microhistory series. On-tap offerings include a temptingly sweet porter with a bitter kick, a cold-filtered Hops & Cannabis and a smoky house gira (kvas). Call ahead to arrange a tour (from €5 for 40 minutes).
The attached restaurant is the best in town and the shop next to the brewery sells all their hop-heavy wares, plus beer snacks.
