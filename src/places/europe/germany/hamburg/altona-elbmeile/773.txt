Rote Flora | Hamburg, Germany |  One of the most outstanding remnants of the area’s rougher days, the graffiti-covered Rote Flora looks one step away from demolition. Once the famous Flora Theatre, it’s now an alternative cultural centre with a calendar of new music, protests and events. The city protected it from gentrification in 2014.
