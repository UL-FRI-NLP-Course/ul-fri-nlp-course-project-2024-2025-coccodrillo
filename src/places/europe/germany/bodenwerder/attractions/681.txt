Burgruine Polle | Fairy-Tale Road, Germany |  Sitting on a crag in a loop of the Weser River in the little village of Polle, 15km from Bodenwerder, this wonderfully accessible castle ruin (c 1200), affords beautiful views over the river valley below. You can climb to the top of the tower or just admire the views from the quirky sculpture garden within the garden walls. This is an offbeat, special spot.
