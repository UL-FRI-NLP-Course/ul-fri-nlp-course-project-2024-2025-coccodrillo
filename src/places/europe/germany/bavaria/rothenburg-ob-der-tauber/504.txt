Stadtmauer | Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany |  With time and fresh legs, a 2.5km circular walk around the unbroken ring of town walls gives a sense of the importance medieval people placed on defending their settlements. A great lookout point is the eastern tower, the Röderturm, but for the most impressive views head to the western side of town, where a sweeping view of the Tauber Valley includes the Doppelbrücke, a double-decker bridge.
