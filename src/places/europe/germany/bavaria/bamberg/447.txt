Historisches Museum | Bamberg, Germany |  Bamberg's main museum fills the Alte Hofhaltung (old court hall), a former prince-bishops' palace near the cathedral, with a mixed bag of exhibits. These include a model of the pilgrimage church Vierzehnheiligen and the Bamberger GÃ¶tzen, ancient stone sculptures found in the region. Often of greater interest are the expertly curated special exhibitions, which examine aspects of the region's past in more detail.
In winter the museum is often only open for special exhibitions.
