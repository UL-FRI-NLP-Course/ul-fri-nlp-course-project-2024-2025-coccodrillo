Klein Venedig | Bamberg, Germany |  A row of diminutive, half-timbered cottages once inhabited by fishermen and their families (hence the street's name meaning 'fishery') comprises Bamberg’s Klein Venedig (Little Venice), which hems the Regnitz’s east bank between Markusbrücke and Untere Brücke. The little homes balance on poles set right into the water and are fronted by tiny gardens and terraces (wholly unlike Venice, but who cares), the river flowing sluggishly past just centimetres below ground level.
Klein Venedig is well worth a stroll but looks at least as pretty from a distance, especially in summer when red geraniums spill from flower boxes. Good vantage points include the Untere Brücke near the Altes Rathaus, and Am Leinritt on the opposite bank. Notice the boats tied up outside each house – locals still use them to get around.
