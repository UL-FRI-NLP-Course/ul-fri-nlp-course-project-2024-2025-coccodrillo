Felseng채nge | Nuremberg, Germany |  Deep beneath the Albrecht D체rer Monument on Albrecht-D체rer-Platz lurks the chilly Felseng채nge. Departing from the brewery shop at Bergstrasse 19, tours descend to this four-storey subterranean warren, which dates from the 14th century and once housed a brewery and a beer cellar. During WWII, it served as an air-raid shelter. Tours take a minimum of three people and last 60 to 70 minutes. Take a jacket against the damp chill.
