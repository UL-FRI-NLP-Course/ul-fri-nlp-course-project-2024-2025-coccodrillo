Maximilianmuseum | Augsburg, Germany |  The Maximilianmuseum occupies two patrician townhouses joined by a statue-studded courtyard covered by a glass-and-steel roof. Highlights include a fabulous collection of Elias Hollâ€™s original wooden models for his architectural creations, and a collection of gold and silver coins. However, the real highlights here are the expertly curated temporary exhibitions on a variety of Bavarian themes.
