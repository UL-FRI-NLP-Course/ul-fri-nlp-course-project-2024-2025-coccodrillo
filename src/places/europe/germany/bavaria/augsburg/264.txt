Rathausplatz | Augsburg, Germany |  The heart of Augsburg’s Altstadt, this large, pedestrianised square is anchored by the Augustusbrunnen, a fountain honouring the Roman emperor; its four figures represent the Lech River and the Wertach, Singold and Brunnenbach brooks.
Rising above the square are the twin onion-domed spires of the Renaissance Rathaus, built by Elias Holl from 1615 to 1620 and crowned by a 4m-tall pine cone, the city’s emblem (also an ancient fertility symbol). Upstairs is the Goldener Saal, a huge banquet hall with an amazing gilded and frescoed coffered ceiling.For panoramic views over Rathausplatz and the city, climb to the top of the Perlachturm, a former guard tower, and also an Elias Holl creation.
