Aegidienkirche | Hanover, Germany |  This former Gothic church (dating from 1347) was never repaired or reconstructed after it was bombed in 1943, and today stands as a reminder of the horrors of war. Inside the ruin is the Peace Bell, donated by sister city Hiroshima. Every 6 August at 8.15am, the date and time of the atomic detonation at Hiroshima, a delegation from both cities meets here to ring the bell.
