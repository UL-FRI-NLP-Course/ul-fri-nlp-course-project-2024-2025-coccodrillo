Erlebnis Zoo | Hanover, Germany |  More than 175 species of animals roam modern enclosures at this 22-hectare zoo east of the centre, though the experience doesn't feel particularly worth the steep price tag. If you go at the weekend, be prepared to jostle through hordes of stroller-pushing families. Children under age two are admitted free.
U-Bahn line 11 terminates right outside.
