Kestner Gesellschaft | Hanover, Germany |  Itâ€™s always worth checking listings for the Kestner Gesellschaft. Founded in 1916 to bring innovative artworks from international artists to Hanover, the society exhibited works by Otto Dix, Georg Grosz, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee before they became famous; today this renowned gallery still curates shows that later tour Europe. Its wonderfully light, high-ceilinged premises were once a bathhouse.
