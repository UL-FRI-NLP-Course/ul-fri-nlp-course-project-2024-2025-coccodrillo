Schlossmuseum | Frankfurt & Southern Rhineland, Germany |  Ornate furnishings, carriages and paintings pack the Schlossmuseum, one block east of Luisenplatz. It occupies the southeast corner of the Schloss complex, one-time residence of the landgraves and grand dukes of Hessen-Darmstadt. Rebuilt after WWII damage, it is now part of Darmstadt's university, the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. The only way to visit is on one-hour tours (in German; some guides speak English).
