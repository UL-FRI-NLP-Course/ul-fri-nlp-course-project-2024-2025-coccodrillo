Rheinisches Landesmuseum | Trier, Germany |  A scale model of 4th-century Trier and rooms filled with tombstones, mosaics, rare gold coins (including the 1993-discovered Trier Gold Hoard, the largest preserved Roman gold hoard in the world, with over 2600 gold coins) and some fantastic glass are highlights of this museum, which affords an extraordinary look at local Roman life.
