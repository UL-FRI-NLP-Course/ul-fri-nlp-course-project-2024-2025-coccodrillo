Rathaus | Bremen City, Germany |  Bremen's landmark and Unesco-listed Rathaus (city hall) dates to 1400 but was a work in progress for centuries, as succeeding generations each tried to leave their own mark on the ever-growing complex. Much of the most lavish detail was added in the 17th century. It's the only town hall in Germany from the late Middle Ages that has survived the centuries intact.
