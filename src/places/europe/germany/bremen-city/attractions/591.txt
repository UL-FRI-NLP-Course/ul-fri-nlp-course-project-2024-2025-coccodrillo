Town Musicians of Bremen Statue | Bremen City, Germany |  Local artist Gerhard Marcks cast this 1951 statute of the famous quartet in their most famous pose â€“ scaring the robbers who invaded their house, with the rooster atop the cat, perched on the dog, on the shoulders of the donkey. On Sundays at noon between May and September a re-enactment of the story is staged for the kiddies.
