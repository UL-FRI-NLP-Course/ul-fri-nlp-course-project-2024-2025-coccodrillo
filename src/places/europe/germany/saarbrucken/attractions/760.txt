Basilika St Johann | Frankfurt & Southern Rhineland, Germany |  This dazzlingly baroque Catholic church, designed by Friedrich Joachim Stengel and completed in 1758, wows you with its gleaming gold altars, pulpit, organ case and overhead ray-burst design – and with its legions of ubercute putti. As you face the facade, the entrance is to the left around the side on Türkenstrasse.
