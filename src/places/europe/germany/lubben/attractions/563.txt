Museum Schloss Lübben | Spreewald, Germany |  The prettiest building in town is the petite Schloss, now home to a nicely curated regional history museum. Exhibit highlights include an interactive town model and a 2m-long medieval executioner’s sword. Follow up with a (free) wander around the Schlossinsel, an artificial archipelago with gardens, a leafy maze, playgrounds, cafes and a harbour area where you can board punts for leisurely tours.
