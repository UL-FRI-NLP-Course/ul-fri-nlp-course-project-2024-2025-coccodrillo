Kloster Alpirsbach | The Black Forest, Germany |  All the more evocative for its lack of adornment, this 11th-century former Benedictine monastery effectively conveys the simple, spiritual life in its Romanesque three-nave church, spartan cells and Gothic cloister, which hosts candlelit concerts from June to August.
