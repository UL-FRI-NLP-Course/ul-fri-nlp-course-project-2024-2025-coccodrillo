Schlossturm & SchifffahrtMuseum | Düsseldorf, Germany |  Looking a bit forlorn by the river, the Schlossturm is all that’s left of the electors’ palace, which burned down in 1872. Recently restored, it houses a multimedia exhibit about shipping and trading on the Rhine and a cafe in the top of the tower.
