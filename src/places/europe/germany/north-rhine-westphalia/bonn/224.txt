August Macke-Haus | Bonn, Germany |  The expressionist painter August Macke (1887–1914) lived and worked in this house in the three years before his untimely death on the battlefields in WWI. Soak up the master’s aura in his recreated studio and see some originals; the finest works, though, are not far away at the Kunstmuseum Bonn.
