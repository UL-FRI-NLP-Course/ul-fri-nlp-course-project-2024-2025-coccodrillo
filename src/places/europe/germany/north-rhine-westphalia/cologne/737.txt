Museum f√ºr Angewandte Kunst | Cologne, Germany |  If Aalto, Eames and Olivetti are music to your ears, you should swing by the Museum of Applied Arts, which displays a prestigious and extensive collection of classic and innovative objects in its newly reopened Design section. The historical collection upstairs, meanwhile, will remain closed for restoration for the foreseeable future.
