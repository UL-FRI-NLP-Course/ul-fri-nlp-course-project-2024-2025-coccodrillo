KölnTriangle Panorama | Cologne, Germany |  The noise of the city fades to a quiet hum on the viewing platform located at a lofty 103m atop the KölnTriangle office tower on the right Rhine bank across from the Cologne Cathedral. The building, with its shiny glass and aluminum facade, is an eye-catcher in its own right.
