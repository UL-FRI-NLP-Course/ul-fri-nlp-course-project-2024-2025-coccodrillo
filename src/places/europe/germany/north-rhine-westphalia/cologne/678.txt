Church of St Maria im Kapitol | Cologne, Germany |  The striking clover-leaf choir is an architectural feature pioneered at this 11th-century Romanesque church, where major treasures include the ethereal stained-glass window, ornately carved wooden doors from 1065 and a spectacularly ornate Renaissance rood screen.
The church roughly follows the outline of the ancient Roman temple that stood here before.
