Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum | Cologne, Germany |  This ethno-museum makes a bold opening statement with a huge rice barn from Sulawesi filling its cavernous lobby. Beyond here are three floors of theme-based exhibits (art, living, death and the afterlife, religions etc) on the cultures of the world; fear not about getting your knuckles rapped – many are interactive and you're encouraged to touch.
A combination ticket with the adjacent Museum Schnütgen costs €10 (concession €7).
