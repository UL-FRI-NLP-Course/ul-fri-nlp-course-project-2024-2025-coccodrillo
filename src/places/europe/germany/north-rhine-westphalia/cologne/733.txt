Church of St Gereon | Cologne, Germany |  The most eccentric looking of Cologne's many Romanesque churches, St Gereon grew from a late-Roman chapel into this massive complex lidded by a 10-sided dome decorated with delicate ribbed vaulting. This translates into a stunning architectural ensemble filled with treasures, beautiful stained-glass windows and red-and-gold dome ceiling.
