Mäuseturm | Rhine Valley, Germany |  The Mouse Tower, on an island near the confluence of the Nahe and Rhine, is where – according to legend – Hatto II, the 10th-century archbishop of Mainz, was devoured alive by mice as punishment for his oppressive rule. In fact, the name is probably a mutation of Mautturm (toll tower), which reflects the building’s medieval function.
