Deutsches Weintor | German Wine Route, Germany |  There's no missing the start of the German Wine Route, which is marked by this towering stone gate, the 1936-built Deutsches Weintor. Inside is one of Germany's largest wine cooperatives. The adjacent Vinothek doubles as a tourist information office.
