Theater Figuren Museum | Lübeck, Germany |  Even if you think you don't like puppets, don’t miss this wondrous collection of some 1200 puppets, props, posters and more from Europe, Asia and Africa. The artistry is amazing, as is the ancient alley where it's located; try to catch a performance at its theatre. The museum was closed for renovations at the time of writing.
