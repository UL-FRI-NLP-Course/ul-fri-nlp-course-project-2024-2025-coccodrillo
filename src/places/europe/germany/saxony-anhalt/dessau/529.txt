Haus Kandinsky/Klee | Central Germany, Germany |  Closed for renovation in 2018, Haus Kandinsky/Klee is scheduled to reopen in 2019 and is most notable for the varying pastel shades in which Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee painted their walls (re-created today). There's also biographical information about the two artists and special exhibitions about their work.
The ticket price grants entry into all four of the Meisterh√§user buildings.
