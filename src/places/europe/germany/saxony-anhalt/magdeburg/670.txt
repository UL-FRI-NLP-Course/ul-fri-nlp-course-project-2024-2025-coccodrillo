Kunstmuseum Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen | Central Germany, Germany |  Magdeburg’s oldest building, a decommissioned medieval monastery, is now a museum presenting regional sculptures and contemporary art from Saxony-Anhalt. The front door, designed by popular local artist Heinrich Apel (b 1935), is fun: knock with the woman’s necklace and push down on the man’s hat to enter. Admission to the cloister is free.
