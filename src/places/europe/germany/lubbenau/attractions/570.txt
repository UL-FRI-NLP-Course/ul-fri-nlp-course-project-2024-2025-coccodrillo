Spreewald-Museum LÃ¼bbenau | Spreewald, Germany |  Take a trip down the Spreewald memory lane at this regional history museum imaginatively set up like a historical department store. Stops include a grocery, a bakery, a furrier and a shoemaker as well as a clothing store featuring traditional Sorb garb. A modern annexe houses the locomotive and a passenger car of the Spreewaldbahn, a narrow-gauge train that connected local villages from 1898 until 1970.
