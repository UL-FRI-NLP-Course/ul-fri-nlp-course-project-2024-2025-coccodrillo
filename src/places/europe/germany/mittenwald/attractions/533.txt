Geigenbaumuseum | Mittenwald, Germany |  Matthias Klotz (1653–1743) is the man credited with turning Mittenwald into an internationally renowned centre of violin making. Learn more about him, the craft and the instrument itself in the engagingly organised Geigenbaumuseum. There’s still a violin-making school in town today and the film showing the many steps required in fashioning the instrument is truly fascinating. The museum is also the venue for occasional concerts.
