St Peterskirche | Munich, Germany |  Some 306 steps divide you from the best view of central Munich via the 92m tower of St Peterskirche, central Munich's oldest church (1150). Inside awaits a virtual textbook of art through the centuries. Worth a closer peek are the Gothic St-Martin-Altar, the baroque ceiling fresco by Johann Baptist Zimmermann and rococo sculptures by Ignaz GÃ¼nther.
