Münzhof | Munich, Germany |  The former Münzhof (mint) has a pretty courtyard that's remarkable for its three-storey Renaissance arcades dating from 1567. An inscription on the western side of the building reads Moneta Regis (Money Rules), particularly apt words for this well-heeled part of Europe. The building now houses the agency charged with protecting Bavaria's many historical monuments.
