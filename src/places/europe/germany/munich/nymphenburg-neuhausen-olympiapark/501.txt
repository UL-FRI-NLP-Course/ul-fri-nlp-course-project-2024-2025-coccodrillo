Neuer Botanischer Garten | Munich, Germany |  Munich's verdant New Botanical Garden segues smoothly from the north side of the palace park and ranks among the most important in Europe. About a century old, it boasts some 14,000 plant species from around the world. Highlights include the Victorian-style Palmenhaus (glass palm house) with its famous collection of tropical and subtropical plants. Other greenhouses shelter cacti, orchids, ferns, carnivorous plants and other leafy treasures.
