Klosterkirche St Anna im Lehel | Munich, Germany |  The Asamkirche may be more sumptuous, but the Klosterkirche St Anna im Lehel is actually a collaboration of the top dogs of the rococo. Johann Michael Fischer designed the building, and Cosmas Damian Asam painted the stunning ceiling fresco and altar. This was the first rococo church to be built in Munich.
