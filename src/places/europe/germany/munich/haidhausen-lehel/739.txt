St Nikolaikirche | Munich, Germany |  St Nikolaikirche was first built in 1315 in Gothic style, only to go all baroque three centuries later. Outside the prim church ensemble of St Nikolai and Lorettokapelle, the covered walkway protects some pretty nifty 'Stations of the Cross' made of Nymphenburg porcelain. Today the church is used by a Ukrainian Orthodox congregation.
