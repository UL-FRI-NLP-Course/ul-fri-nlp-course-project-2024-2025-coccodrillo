NS Dokuzentrum | Munich, Germany |  The mission of the NS Dokuzentrum, located right at the heart of what was once Nazi central in Munich, is to educate locals and visitors alike about the Nazi period and Munich's role in it. The excellent exhibition looks to find the answers to questions such as how did Hitler come to power, what led to the war, and why did democracy fail. Period documents, artefacts, films and multimedia stations help visitors form their own understanding of this history.
