Leuchtenberg-Palais | Munich, Germany |  Odeonsplatz marks the beginning of the Maxvorstadt, a 19th-century quarter built to link central Munich with Schwabing to the north. Leo von Klenze masterminded its overall design and several of the buildings, including the Leuchtenberg-Palais, a stately town palace modelled after a Roman palazzo and now home of the Bavarian Finance Ministry.
