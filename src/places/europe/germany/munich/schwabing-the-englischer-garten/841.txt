Monopteros | Munich, Germany |  At the top of a gentle hill in the Englischer Garten stands the heavily photographed Monopteros (1838), a small Greek temple built by 19th-century star architect, Leo von Klenze. From here you can admire the view of the Munich skyline, which is particularly attractive at sunset.
