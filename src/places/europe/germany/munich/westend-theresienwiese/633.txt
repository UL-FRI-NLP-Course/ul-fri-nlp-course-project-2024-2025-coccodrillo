Bavariastatue | Munich, Germany |  The Bavariastatue is an 18m-high Amazon in the Statue of Liberty tradition, oak wreath in her hand and lion at her feet. This iron lady has a cunning design that makes her seem solid, but actually you can climb via the knee joint up to the head for a great view of the Oktoberfest, which takes place in the surrounding grounds. At other times, views are not particularly inspiring.
