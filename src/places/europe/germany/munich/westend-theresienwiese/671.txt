Ruhmeshalle | Munich, Germany |  The classical Ruhmeshalle is an open gallery of famous Bavarians, whose busts adorn the wall like hunting trophies. The hall curls horseshoe-like around the green-tinged Bavariastatue: climb up to the head cavity to get a great view from her hollow eyes of the 'Wies'n', as the locals call the surrounding Oktoberfest grounds.
