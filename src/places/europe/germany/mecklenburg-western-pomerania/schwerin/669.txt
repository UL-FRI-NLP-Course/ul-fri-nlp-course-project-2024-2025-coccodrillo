Pfaffenteich | Northern Germany, Germany |  Schwerin's central lake was created by a dam in the 12th century. Through the centuries it was surrounded by some of the city's most elegant buildings. At the southwest corner, the vividly orange Arsenal dates from 1840. You can cross the waters on a small ferry that makes four stops.
