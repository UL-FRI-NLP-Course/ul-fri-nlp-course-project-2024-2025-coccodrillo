Schwerin Dom | Northern Germany, Germany |  Above the Markt, the soaring Gothic Dom is a superb example of north German red-brick architecture. You can climb up to the viewing platform of its 19th-century cathedral tower (118m), which is a mere 50cm taller than Rostockâ€™s Petrikirche. Down on earth, check out the elaborately carved pews. Construction lasted from 1270 to 1892.
