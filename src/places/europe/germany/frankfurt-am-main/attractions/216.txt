Frankfurt Stock Exchange | Frankfurt am Main, Germany |  The famous old Börse, built in 1843, is an impressively colonnaded neoclassical structure. The porch is decorated with allegorical statues of the five continents. A new visitor centre is expected to open in 2019, and will offer guided tours.
In the square out front, a sculpture entitled Bulle und Bär depicts a showdown between a bull and a bear.
