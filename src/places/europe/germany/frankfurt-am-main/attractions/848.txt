Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen | Frankfurt am Main, Germany |  Located in the centre of the RÃ¶merberg, this bronze fountain depicts the goddess Justitia holding up scales and a sword. The first fountain was inaugurated in 1543, with several replacements over the years. In 1612, at the coronation of Matthias, the fountain ran with wine.
