Dommuseum | Frankfurt am Main, Germany |  To the left as you enter the cathedral, the Dommuseum has a small collection of precious liturgical objects, and a young girl's grave dating from 680 AD, with gold jewellery, glass and clay vessels and amulets, which was discovered in 1991. Temporary exhibitions of contemporary art often take place in the cloister.
