WildtierPark Edersee | Fairy-Tale Road, Germany |  Species native (and often those that have been reintroduced) to the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park, including wolves, red deer, eagle owls, lynx, bison, wildcats, ibex and mouflon, can be seen up close at this 80-acre wildlife park on the northeastern corner of the lake in Edertal. An adventure playground, a petting zoo, an educational exhibition and an on-site restaurant make it a great bet for families.
