Kirchdorf Wamberg | Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany |  For an easy hike accompanied by achingly quaint, chocolate-box views head to Germany's highest Kirchdorf (basically a hamlet with a church where services are held). You can walk from near the hospital (around 45 minutes) or take the Eckbauerbahn lift then walk along the path heading northeast through some exquisite Alpine scenery. The views from the village are worth the effort.
