Seepromenade | Lake Constance, Germany |  In summer the harbourside promenade has a happy-go-lucky air, with its palms, bobbing boats and folk sunning themselves in pavement cafes.Out at the harbour gates, looking across to the Alps, is Lindau’s signature 36m-high Neuer Leuchtturm and, just in case you forget which state you’re in, a statue of the Bavarian lion. The square, tile-roofed 13th-century Mangturm (Old Lighthouse) guards the northern edge of the sheltered port.
