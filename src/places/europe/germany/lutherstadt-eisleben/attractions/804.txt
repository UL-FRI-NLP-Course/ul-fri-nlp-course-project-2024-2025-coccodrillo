St Annenkirche | Central Germany, Germany |  This church features a stunning Steinbilder-Bibel (stone-picture Bible; 1585), the only one of its kind in Europe, and a wittily decorated pulpit. While district vicar, Martin Luther stayed in the apartments of the St Annenkirche, 10 minutes west of the Markt in the hills above Eisleben.
