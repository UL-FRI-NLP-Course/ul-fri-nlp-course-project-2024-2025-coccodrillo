Park Charlottenhof | Potsdam, Germany |  Laid out by Peter Lenn√© for Friedrich Wilhelm IV, Park Charlottenhof segues imperceptibly from Park Sanssouci but gets far fewer visitors. Buildings here reflect the king's passion for Italy. The small neoclassical Schloss Charlottenhof, for instance, was modelled after a Roman villa. It was designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel.
