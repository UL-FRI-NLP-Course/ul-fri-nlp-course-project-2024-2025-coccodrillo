Filmmuseum Potsdam | Potsdam, Germany |  The permanent exhibit of this venerable yet completely updated film museum presents an engaging romp through the history of the UFA (one of the world's oldest film studios), its GDR-era successor DEFA and its contemporary incarnation as the Studio Babelsberg. Temporary exhibits zero in on specific themes, people and periods, while the cinema (tickets €6, concession €5) shows international art house fare, retrospectives, children's films and silent movies accompanied by an organ.
