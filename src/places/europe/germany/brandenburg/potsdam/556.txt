Orangerieschloss | Potsdam, Germany |  Modelled after an Italian Renaissance villa, the 300m-long Orangery Palace (1864) was the favourite building project of Friedrich Wilhelm IV â€“ a passionate Italophile. Its highlight is the Raffaelsaal (Raphael Hall), which brims with 19th-century copies of the famous painter's masterpieces. The greenhouses are still used for storing potted plants in winter. Views from the tower are quite nice as well.
