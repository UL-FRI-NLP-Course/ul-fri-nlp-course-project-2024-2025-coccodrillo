Belvedere auf dem Pfingstberg | Potsdam, Germany |  For splendid views over Potsdam and surrounds, ascend the spiralling wrought-iron staircases of this twin-towered palace, commissioned by Friedrich Wilhelm IV and modelled on an Italian Renaissance-style villa. There's a small exhibit chronicling the history of the building and the 1801 Pomonatempel just below it. The latter was Karl Friedrich Schinkelâ€™s very first architectural commission at age 19.
