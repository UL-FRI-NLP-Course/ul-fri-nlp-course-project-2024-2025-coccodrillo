Strandpromenade | Rügen Island, Germany |  A highlight of Binz is simply strolling its 4km-long north–south beach promenade, lined with elegant villas. At the southern end of the built-up area, you’ll find the palatial Kurhaus, a lovely 1908 building housing a luxury hotel. In front of it is the long pier. Strandpromenade continues further south from here, and becomes markedly less busy.
