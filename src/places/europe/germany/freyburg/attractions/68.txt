Schloss Neuenburg | Central Germany, Germany |  This large medieval castle on the hill above town is one of Freyburg’s highlights. It houses an excellent museum that illuminates various aspects of medieval life. The complex includes a rare Romanesque two-storey (or ‘double’) chapel and a free-standing tower, the Dicker Wilhelm, which has further historical exhibitions and splendid views.
