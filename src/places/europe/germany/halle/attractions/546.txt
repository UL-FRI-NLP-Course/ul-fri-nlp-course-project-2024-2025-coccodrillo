Kunstmuseum Moritzburg | Central Germany, Germany |  The late-Gothic Moritzburg castle forms a fantastic setting for this superb permanent collection of art. The addition of a glass and aluminium roof over the north and west wings, which had been ruined since the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), nearly doubled the exhibition area. Airy and sky-lit, the new space is entirely dedicated to modern art. Older parts of the castle showcase works from medieval times to the 19th century.
