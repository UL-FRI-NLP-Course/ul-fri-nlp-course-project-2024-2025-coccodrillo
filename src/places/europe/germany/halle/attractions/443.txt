Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen | Central Germany, Germany |  Halle’s central square has no fewer than five towers. One of these is the freestanding bell tower known as Roter Turm, but the other four rise up from the bulky late-Gothic Marktkirche. Inside is its prized possession, Luther’s original death mask of wax (ask the attendant to take you into the separate room to see it). It also has a Renaissance pulpit from which he preached.
Organ music is performed here at noon on Tuesday and Thursday, and on Saturday from May through September.
