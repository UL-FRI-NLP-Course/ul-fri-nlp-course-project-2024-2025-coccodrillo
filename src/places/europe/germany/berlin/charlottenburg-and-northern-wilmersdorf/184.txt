Schloss Charlottenburg - Neuer Flügel | City West & Charlottenburg, Berlin |  The palace’s most beautiful rooms are the flamboyant private chambers of Frederick the Great, designed in 1746 by the period's star architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff. Standouts include the confection-like White Hall banquet room, the mirrored and gilded Golden Gallery and the paintings by Watteau, Pesne and other 18th-century French masters. Also note the apartment of Luise (1776–1810; a popular queen and wife of King Friedrich Wilhelm III), with its stunning bedroom designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel.
