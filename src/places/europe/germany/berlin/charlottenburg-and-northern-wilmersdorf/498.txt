Mahnmal am Breitscheidplatz | City West & Charlottenburg, Berlin |  This simple memorial honours the victims of the terror attack of 19 December 2016, when an Islamist asylum seeker drove into a crowd at the Christmas market held every year on Breitscheidplatz. Unveiled on the event's one-year anniversary, it consists of a golden crack that runs down the steps descending from the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, with the names of the 12 victims chiselled into the front of the steps.
