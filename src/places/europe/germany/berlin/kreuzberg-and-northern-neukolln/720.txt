Künstlerhaus Bethanien | Kreuzberg, Berlin |  Founded in 1975, the Künstlerhaus is an artistic sanctuary and creative cauldron for emerging artists from around the globe. In 2010 it moved into this former light-fixture factory, where it maintains one of Germany’s largest artist-in-residence programs. Exhibits showcase their work, as well as that of former residents and other artists.
