Luftbr√ºckendenkmal | Kreuzberg, Berlin |  Nicknamed Hungerharke (Hunger Rake), the Berlin Airlift Memorial right outside the former Tempelhof Airport honours those who participated in keeping the city fed and free during the 1948 Berlin Blockade. A trio of spikes represents the three air corridors used by the Western Allies, while a plinth bears the names of the 79 people who died in this colossal effort.
