Chamissoplatz | Kreuzberg, Berlin |  Created in the 1880s, this charismatic square with its cobbled streets, old-time lanterns and octagonal public latrine looks virtually unchanged 140 years later. No surprise that movie directors favour it as an outdoor set for Old Berlin.
The best time to visit is Saturday morning, when one of Berlinâ€™s longest-running organic farmers' markets takes over.
