Kulturbrauerei | Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin |  The fanciful red-and-yellow brick buildings of this 19th-century brewery have been upcycled into a cultural powerhouse with a small village's worth of venues, from concert and theatre halls to nightclubs, dance studios, a multiplex cinema and a free GDR history museum. The main entrances are on Knaackstrasse and Sredzkistrasse.
On Sundays, foodies fill up on global treats at the street-food market, while in December, the old buildings make a lovely backdrop for a Swedish-style Lucia Christmas market.
