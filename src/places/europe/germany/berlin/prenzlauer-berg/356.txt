Pfefferberg | Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin |  This rambling listed brewery compound has been adapted to house cultural venues, resto-bars, a hostel and offices. Beer production resumed in 2013 with the opening of the Pfefferbräu microbrewery.
At the Christinenstrasse (northern) entrance, the Tchoban Foundation – Museum für Architekturzeichnung (Museum for Architectural Drawing) is housed in a spectacular pile of relief-decorated sandstone cubes designed by Sergei Tchoban. Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson has his studio next door.
