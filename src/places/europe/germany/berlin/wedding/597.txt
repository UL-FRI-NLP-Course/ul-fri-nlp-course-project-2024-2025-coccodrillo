Preussische Spirituosen Manufaktur | Berlin, Germany |  This historic factory has made premium spirits and liqueurs since 1874 and even counted German Kaiser Wilhelm I among its customers. All is produced by hand and in limited quantities using ancient equipment. Today its Adler label gin and vodka is served in fine drinking parlours around town and, along with other potent potions, sold in the on-site shop. Tastings and tours are available by arrangement.
