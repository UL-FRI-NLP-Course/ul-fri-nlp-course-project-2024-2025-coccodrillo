Boxhagener Platz | Friedrichshain, Berlin |  The heart of Friedrichshain, 'Boxi' is a lovely, leafy square with benches and a playground. It's framed by restored 19th-century buildings harbouring boho cafes, artisanal bakeries and shabby-chic boutiques. The area is busiest during the Saturday farmers' market and on Sundays, when a flea market brings in folks from all over town.
