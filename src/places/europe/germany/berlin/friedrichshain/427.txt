Holzmarkt | Friedrichshain, Berlin |  The Holzmarkt urban village on the Spree is a perpetually evolving cultural open playground – and a nose-thumbing at the luxury lofts, hotels and office buildings that continue to gobble up the riverside real estate.
Grab a pizza and a beer and count the boats passing by while chilling in the Mörchenpark, or treat yourself to a fine meal at Katerschmaus and dance through the night at Kater Blau.
