Urban Spree | Friedrichshain, Berlin |  Comprising a gallery, a bookshop, artist studios, a concert room and a beer garden, this grassroots urban art hub is a top stop in the RAW Gel√§nde compound along Revaler Strasse, especially in summer. That's also when it hosts festivals and special events and presents Berlin's best street musicians on weekends.
The building's facade doubles as an 'Artist Wall', with new urban artworks going up every month or so.
