Dong Xuan Center | Berlin, Germany |  This sprawling cluster of industrial halls repurposed from a Cold Warâ€“era factory for carbon products is today the cultural, culinary and commercial hub of Berlin's sizeable Vietnamese community. Each building is lined with long corridors where vendors peddle plastic flowers, cheap clothing, sacks of rice and exotic produce. Even if you're not buying, it's fun to browse and wrap up a visit with a bowl of authentic pho soup.
