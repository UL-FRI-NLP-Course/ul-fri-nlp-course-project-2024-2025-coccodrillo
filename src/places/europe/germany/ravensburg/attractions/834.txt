Mehlsack | Lake Constance, Germany |  The all-white Mehlsack (flour sack) is a tower marking the Altstadt’s southern edge. A steep staircase leads up to the Veitsburg, a quaint baroque castle that now harbours a restaurant of the same name, with outlooks over Ravensburg’s mosaic of red-tiled roofs.
