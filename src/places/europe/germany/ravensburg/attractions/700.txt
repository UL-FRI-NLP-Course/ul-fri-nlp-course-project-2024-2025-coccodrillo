Marienplatz | Lake Constance, Germany |  The heart of the Altstadt is the elongated, pedestrianised Marienplatz, framed by sturdy towers such as the round Gr√ºner Turm, with its lustrous tiled roof, and frescoed patrician houses, such as the late-Gothic, step-gabled Waaghaus. The 15th-century Lederhaus, with its elaborate Renaissance facade, was once the domain of tanners and shoemakers.
