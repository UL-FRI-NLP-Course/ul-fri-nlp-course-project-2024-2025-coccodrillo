Schloss Güstrow | Northern Germany, Germany |  Güstrow's fabulous Renaissance 16th-century Schloss is home to a historical museum as well as a cultural centre, period art exhibitions and occasional concerts. You can tour rooms that recall the luxe excesses of its royal residents. The formal gardens are an exercise in orderly flora.
