Friedrichsplatz | Mannheim, Germany |  Five blocks northeast of the Hauptbahnhof, Friedrichsplatz is an oasis of manicured lawns, lovely flower beds and art-nouveau fountains. Its centrepiece is the 60m-high Wasserturm (Water Tower), a bit of 19th-century civil architecture that has become one of the cityâ€™s symbols. An elegant ensemble of red sandstone edifices, many with arcades, lines the perimeter.
