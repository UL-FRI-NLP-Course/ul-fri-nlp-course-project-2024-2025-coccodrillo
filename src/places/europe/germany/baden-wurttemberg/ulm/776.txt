Albrecht Berblinger Plaque | Ulm, Germany |   This bronze plaque marks where Albrecht Berblinger, a tailor who invented a flying machine, attempted to fly over the Danube in 1811. The so-called ‘Tailor of Ulm’ made an embarrassing splash landing but his design was later shown to be workable (his failure was caused by a lack of thermals on that day).
