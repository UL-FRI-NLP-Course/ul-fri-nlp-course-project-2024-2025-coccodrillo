Stadtmauer | Ulm, Germany |  South of the Fischerviertel, along the Danubeâ€™s north bank, runs the red-brick Stadtmauer (city wall), the height of which was reduced in the 19th century after Napoleon decided that a heavily fortified Ulm was against his best interests. Walk it for fine views over the river, the Altstadt and the slightly off-centre Metzgerturm.
