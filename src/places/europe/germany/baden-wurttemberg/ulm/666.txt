Synagogue | Ulm, Germany |  Fitting neatly into Ulm's ensemble of eye-catching contemporary architecture, this free-standing synagogue was built for the Jewish community and completed in 2012. The architecturally striking edifice sits on the Weinhof, close to the former synagogue that was destroyed during Kristallnacht in 1938. At night its main window shimmers with the Star of David pattern.
