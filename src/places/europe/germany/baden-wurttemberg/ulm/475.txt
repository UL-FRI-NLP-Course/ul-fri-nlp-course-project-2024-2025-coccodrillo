Stadthaus | Ulm, Germany |  Designed by Richard Meier, the contemporary aesthetic of the concrete-and-glass Stadthaus is a dramatic contrast to the Münster. The American architect caused uproar by erecting the postmodern building alongside the city’s Gothic giant but the result is striking. The Stadthaus stages exhibitions and events, and houses the tourist office and a cafe.
