Kunstmuseum Stuttgart | Stuttgart, Germany |  Occupying a shimmering glass cube, this gallery presents high-calibre special exhibits alongside a permanent gallery filled with a prized collection of works by Otto Dix, Willi Baumeister and Stuttgart-born abstract artist Alfred Hölzel. For far-reaching views over the city, head up to the Cube cafe and restaurant.
Out front, the primary colours and geometric forms of Alexander Calder’s mobile catch the eye.
