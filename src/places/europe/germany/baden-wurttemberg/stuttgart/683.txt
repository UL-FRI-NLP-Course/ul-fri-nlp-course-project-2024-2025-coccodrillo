Turmforum | Stuttgart, Germany |  Some of the best views of Stuttgart are from the the top of the tower jutting out from the main train station. A free lift (elevator) deposits you right below the revolving Mercedes star. You also get a bird’s-eye view of 'Stuttgart 21', a huge – and controversial – revamp of the main train station. Exhibits on floors 3, 5 and 7a explain the details.
