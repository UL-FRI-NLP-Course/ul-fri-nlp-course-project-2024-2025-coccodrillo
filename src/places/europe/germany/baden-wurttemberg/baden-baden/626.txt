Trinkhalle | Baden-Baden, Germany |  Standing proud above a manicured park, this neoclassical pump room was built in 1839 as an attractive addition to the Kurhaus. The 90m-long portico is embellished with 19th-century frescos of local legends. Baden-Badenâ€™s elixir of youth, some say, is the free curative mineral water that gushes from a faucet linked to the Friedrichsbad spring.
