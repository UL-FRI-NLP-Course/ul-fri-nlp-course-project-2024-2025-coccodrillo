Neues Schloss | Baden-Baden, Germany |  Vine-swathed steps lead from Marktplatz to the 15th-century Neues Schloss, the former residence of the Baden-Baden margraves, which is set to reopen at some point in the distant future. The lookout is still accessible, and affords far-reaching views over Baden-Badenâ€™s rooftops and spires to the Black Forest beyond.
