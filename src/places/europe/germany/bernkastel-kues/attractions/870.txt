Marktplatz | Moselle Valley, Germany |  Bernkastelâ€™s pretty Marktplatz, a block inland from the bridge, is enclosed by a romantic ensemble of half-timbered houses with beautifully decorated gables. Look for the iron handcuffs, to which criminals were attached, on the facade of the 1608-built Rathaus.
