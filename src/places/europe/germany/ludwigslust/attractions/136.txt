Schloss Ludwigslust | Northern Germany, Germany |  Such was the allure of this palace that when the ducal seat moved 36km north to Schwerin in 1837, some family members continued living here until 1945. Now part of the Schwerin State Museum, its high point is the stately, gilt-columned, high-ceilinged Golden Hall. After lavish renovations, the East Wing has reopened; the royal bedrooms and living quarters are a gilded highlight.
