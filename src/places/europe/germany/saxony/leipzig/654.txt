Kroch-Haus | Leipzig, Germany |  Leipzig's first 'skyscraper', the 11-storey Kroch-Haus is topped by a clock and two muscular bronze sentries, who bash the bell at regular intervals; the motto (in Latin) reads 'Work conquers all'. The first two floors house Leipzig University's small but fascinating collection of Egyptian artefacts, salvaged by German archaeologists from the pyramids over two centuries.
