Pfunds Molkerei | Dresden, Germany |  The Guinness-certified ‘world’s most beautiful dairy shop’, founded in 1880, is a riot of hand-painted tiles and enamelled sculpture, all handmade by Villeroy & Boch. The shop sells replica tiles, wines, cheeses and other milk products. Not surprisingly, the upstairs cafe-restaurant has a strong lactose theme. Slip in between coach tours for a less shuffling look around.
