Naumberger Dom | Central Germany, Germany |  The enormous Cathedral of Sts Peter and Paul is a masterpiece of medieval architecture. While the crypt and the east choir feature elements of the Romanesque, the famous west choir is a prime example of early Gothic design. Here you'll find a dozen monumental statues of the cathedral founders, the work of the so-called Master of Naumburg. Medieval stained-glass windows are augmented by ruby-red modern panes by Neo Rauch, one of the premier artists of the New Leipzig School.
