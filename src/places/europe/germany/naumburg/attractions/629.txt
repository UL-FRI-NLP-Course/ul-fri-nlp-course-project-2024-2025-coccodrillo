Nietzsche Haus | Central Germany, Germany |  The exhibits here consist mostly of photos, documents and reams of biographical text about one of Germany’s greatest philosophers. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) spent most of his childhood in this modest home, acquired by his mother after the death of her husband. In 1890 she brought her son back here to nurse him as he was going slowly mad, allegedly as a result of syphilis.
