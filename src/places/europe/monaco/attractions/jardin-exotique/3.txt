Jardin Exotique | Monaco, Europe |  Home to the world’s largest succulent and cactus collection, from small echinocereus to 10m-tall African candelabras, the gardens tumble down the slopes of Moneghetti through a maze of paths, stairs and bridges. Views of the principality are spectacular. Admission includes the Musée d'Anthropologie, which displays prehistoric remains unearthed in Monaco, and a 35-minute guided tour of the Grotte de l’Observatoire. The prehistoric, stalactite- and stalagmite-laced cave is the only one in Europe where the temperature rises as you descend.
Bus 2 links Jardin Exotique with the town centre.
