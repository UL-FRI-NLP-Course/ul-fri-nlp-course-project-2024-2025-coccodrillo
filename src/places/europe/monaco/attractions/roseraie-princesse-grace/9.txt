Roseraie Princesse Grace | Monaco, Europe |  Thoroughly revamped in 2014, this exuberant collection of over 4000 rose bushes – along with the adjacent Parc Fontvieille – stands out in dramatic contrast to the otherwise sterile high-rise environment of Fontvieille. The garden bursts with colour in springtime, with multihued roses climbing up arbours and encircling the trunks and branches of olive trees.
