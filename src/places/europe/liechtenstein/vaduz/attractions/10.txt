St Florin Cathedral | Vaduz, Liechtenstein |  The former parish church of St Florin was given the status of cathedral in 1997 with the setting up of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vaduz. The stone structure with a 45m-high tower was built in 1874 and designed by Friedrich von Schmidt from Vienna. It sits at the southern end of the pedestrianised zone.
