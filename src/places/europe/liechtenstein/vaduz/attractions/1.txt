Schloss Vaduz | Vaduz, Liechtenstein |  A riot of turrets and towers plonked high on a hillside and set against the theatrical backdrop of jagged mountains, Schloss Vaduz is quite the fairy-tale castle of your wildest dreams. It was built as a fortress in the 12th century and is now the official residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein. Though closed to the public, it is worth the climb for the wide-ranging views. Trails ascend the hill from the end of Egertastrasse.
For a rare peek inside the castle grounds, arrive on 15 August, Liechtensteinâ€™s National Day, when there are magnificent fireworks and the prince invites all Liechtensteiners over to his place for a glass of wine or beer.
