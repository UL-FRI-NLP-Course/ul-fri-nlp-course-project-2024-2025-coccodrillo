Postmuseum | Vaduz, Liechtenstein |  Liechtenstein once made a packet producing souvenir stamps for enthusiasts, but that market has been hit by the rise of email. Here youâ€™ll find all national stamps issued since 1912 in a surprisingly interesting little museum.
It was closed for renovation at the time of research and is scheduled to reopen in early 2019.
