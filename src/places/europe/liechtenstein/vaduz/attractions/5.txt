Parliament Building | Vaduz, Liechtenstein |  Since 2008, Liechtenstein's 25-member Parliament has been convening in this somewhat startlingly modern building. Munich-based architect Hansjörg Göritz designed both it and the central square Peter-Kaiser-Platz, named after the famous local historian Peter Kaiser. The building is made up of the ‘Long House’, the ‘High House’ and the ‘Joining House’.
