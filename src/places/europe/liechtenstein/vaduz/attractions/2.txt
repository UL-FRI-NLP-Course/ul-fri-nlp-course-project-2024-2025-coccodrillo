Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein | Vaduz, Liechtenstein |  This black concrete and basalt cuboid on pedestrianised Städtle hosts temporary exhibitions, revolving around the gallery’s collection of contemporary art, which includes Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Paul Klee and Joseph Beuys originals. The Prince of Liechtenstein's collection of old masters was relocated to the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna. The cafe-sushi-bar revives art-weary gallery goers.
