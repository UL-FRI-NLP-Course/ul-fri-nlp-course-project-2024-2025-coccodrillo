Església de Sant Esteve | Andorra la Vella, Andorra |  These days aligned north–south, Andorra la Vella's parish church dates from the 12th century. Apart from some wonderfully warm, glowing stained-glass windows and the Romanesque apse on its eastern side (some of whose frescoes now lie in Barcelona's Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya), it has little of interest, as it was much reformed in the 20th century.
