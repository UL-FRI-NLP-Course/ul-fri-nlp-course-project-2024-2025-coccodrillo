Barri Antic | Andorra la Vella, Andorra |  The small Barri Antic (intrusively and artificially bisected by Avinguda del Pr√≠ncep Benlloch) was the heart of Andorra la Vella back when the principality's capital was little more than a village. The narrow cobbled streets around the historic Casa de la Vall are flanked by attractive stone houses.
