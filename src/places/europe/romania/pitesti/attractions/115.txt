Piteşti Prison Memorial | Wallachia, Romania |  A modest memorial marks the spot where the city's notorious prison once stood and where insidious mind-control experiments were carried out in the late 1940s and early '50s. The main memorial is a tiled column; nearby is a map of other detention and extermination sites around Romania. It's a 15-minute walk from the centre, heading north on Str Victoriei, which becomes Str Negru Vodă.
