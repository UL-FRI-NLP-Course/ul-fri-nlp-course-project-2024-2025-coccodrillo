Alma Vii Fortified Church | Transylvania, Romania |  In September 2016 the ribbon was cut on fresh restoration works in Alma Vii, and this charismatic village and centrepiece fortified church have never looked finer. The stocky sanctuary dates to the 16th century, though the church vault was given a Gothic makeover in the 19th century. It's flanked by four watchtowers, which reveal Transylvanian traditions through innovative, kid-friendly displays.
