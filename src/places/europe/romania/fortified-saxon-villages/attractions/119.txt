Valea Viilor Fortified Church | Transylvania, Romania |  Standing proud in the whisper-quiet village of Valea Viilor is an 18th-century church with weighty protective walls. It’s necessary to call a caretaker to get inside (phone number posted outside). Once in, you can climb stairs to walk the perimeter of the old walls and peep at the church’s fine 17th-century altar.
It’s a 14km drive southwest from Mediaș.
