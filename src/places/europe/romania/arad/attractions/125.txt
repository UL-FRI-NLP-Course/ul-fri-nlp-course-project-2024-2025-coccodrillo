Reconciliation Park | Romania, Europe |  This monument park, three blocks west of Pia≈£a Avram Iancu, contains two notable statues. In the centre, the Liberty Monument was erected in 1890 to honour 13 Hungarian generals executed after the 1849 Hungarian uprising. Nearby, an even more impressive Triumphal Arch was built in 2004 to remember the Romanian fighters killed in the same insurrection.
