National Military Museum | Bucharest, Romania |  The National Military Museum doubles nicely as a Romanian history museum, with its chronological rundown of how the country defended itself. In the museum entrance, note the 1988 communist mural that celebrates the Palace of Parliament (painted just a year before the revolution). In back is a hangar with early aviator Aurel Vlaicuâ€™s historic 1911 plane.
