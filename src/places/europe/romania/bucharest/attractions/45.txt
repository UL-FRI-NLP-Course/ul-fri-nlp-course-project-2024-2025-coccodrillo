National History Museum | Bucharest, Romania |  Hardly a 'national' museum of history, given the rather small collection of maps, statues and jewels on display. The museum is strong, however, on the country's ties to ancient Rome. The highlight of a visit is a replica of a 2nd-century column to Roman Emperor Trajan.
