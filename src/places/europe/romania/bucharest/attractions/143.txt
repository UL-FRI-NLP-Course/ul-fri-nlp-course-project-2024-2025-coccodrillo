St Apostles’ Church | Bucharest, Romania |  Tiny St Apostles’ Church, north of B-dul Unirii (west of the Piaţa Unirii), survived Ceauşescu's 1980s demolition project – to a degree. The church, built in 1636, was not moved, but the surrounding parkland was ripped up and replaced with blocks of flats. It’s overgrown, with trees and near-abandoned buildings.
