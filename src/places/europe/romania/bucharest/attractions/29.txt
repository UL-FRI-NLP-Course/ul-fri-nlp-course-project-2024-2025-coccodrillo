Creţulescu Church | Bucharest, Romania |  The modest Creţulescu Church stands in repose near the far larger and more dramatic Royal Palace. Look for the original paintings near the door to the church that date from the building's foundation in 1722. The church was damaged and renovated several times over the course of the centuries. In front, there's a bust to the liberal Romanian politician Corneliu Coposu, who spent time in prison under the communists.
