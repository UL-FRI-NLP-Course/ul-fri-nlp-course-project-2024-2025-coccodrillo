County Museum | Transylvania, Romania |  Did you know that Bistriţa is the only place in Transylvania where men’s traditional headwear involves a crown of peacock feathers? Inside a former garrison, Bistriţa’s County Museum offers interesting tidbits of local history around its three exhibition spaces: ancient history, with Thracian bronze tools; the rural past, with handicrafts and farming tools; and a collection of modern art.
On our visit, the museum was anxiously awaiting restoration work but the collections were still diverting.
