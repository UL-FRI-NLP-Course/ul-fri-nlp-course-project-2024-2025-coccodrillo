Şugălete | Transylvania, Romania |  Facing the church on the north side of Piaţa Centrală is Şugălete, a row of 13 terraced buildings constructed between 1480 and 1550. This two-floor Renaissance structure, with elegant archways and colourful facades, bustled with trading activity during medieval times.
Şugălete is worth admiring from outside, but it's not possible to enter.
