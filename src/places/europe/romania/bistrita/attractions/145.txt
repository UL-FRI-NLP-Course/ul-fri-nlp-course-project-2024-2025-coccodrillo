Evangelical Church | Transylvania, Romania |  Bistriţa’s number one landmark is the Evangelical Church, whose 76m Gothic tower dominates its main square. Construction began in the 14th century, and Italian architect Petrus Italus de Lugano gave it a Renaissance-style makeover in 1563, adding its portals. It’s worth climbing the tower for views over the town.
