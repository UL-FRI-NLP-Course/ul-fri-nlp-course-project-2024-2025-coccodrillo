Naval History Museum | Constan≈£a, Romania |  This museum offers a fascinating if slightly confusing stroll through 2000 years of maritime history on the Black Sea. The exhibit begins in the Greco-Roman period, with some intricate models of old Roman boats, but quickly moves to the 19th and 20th centuries. The garden is strewn with relics of real propellers, landmines and torpedoes that seem to be rusting into the ground.
