Ion Jalea Sculpture Museum | Constanţa, Romania |  This small museum, just at the entryway to the seaside promenade, features the works of Ion Jalea (1887–1983), a 20th-century sculptor often said to be a forefather of modern technique. Jalea lost an arm as a Romanian soldier in WWI and continued to work using only his right arm.
