Natural History Museum | Sibiu, Romania |  Ornate ceilings flanked by moose heads make this Natural History Museum worth a peep for its 19th-century architecture alone, while the dinosaur garden outside is great for kids. Exhibitions include cave bear remains from 40,000 years ago, a woolly rhino skull, and some displays of taxidermied Romanian wildlife (to the sound of hooting birds and huffing brown bears, piped through the display rooms).
