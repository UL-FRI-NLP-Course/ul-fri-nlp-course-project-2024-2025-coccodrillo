Strada Sforii | Braşov, Romania |  Formerly an access route for firefighters, Strada Sforii is one of the narrowest streets in Europe at 1.2m wide. Lurid tales have sprung up about Vlad Țepeș snatching a kiss from his future wife in this very lane, but it's mostly modern-day lovers who squeeze through.
