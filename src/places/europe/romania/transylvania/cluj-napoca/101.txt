National History Museum of Transylvania | Cluj-Napoca, Romania |  Within this museum of regional history you’ll discover Dacian artefacts, mostly from Sarmizegetusa’s archaeological sites, including glass blow pipes, blacksmithing tools, reconstructed urns and silver bracelets. English information is scant, but there are a few virtual reality games aimed at children, to immerse you in historic Romanian dwellings (if you can get them to work). The museum is on the 2nd floor.
