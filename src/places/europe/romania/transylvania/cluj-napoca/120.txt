Tailor's Tower | Cluj-Napoca, Romania |  Rotating exhibitions of local art within this stone tower can be somewhat threadbare. But it’s still worth wandering inside this pointy-roofed former lookout, which dates to the 15th century but was rebuilt in 1718 with 150 cartfuls of stone.
There’s a fetching statue of anti-Ottoman revolutionary Baba Novac outside.
