Gorham's Cave Complex | Gibraltar, Europe |  Inscribed on Unesco's World Heritage list in 2016, these four archaeologically rich cliffside caves on Gibraltar's southeastern coast were inhabited by Neanderthals from around 127,000 to 32,000 years ago. Though the caves themselves are off-limits, you can see them from the nearby viewing platform.
