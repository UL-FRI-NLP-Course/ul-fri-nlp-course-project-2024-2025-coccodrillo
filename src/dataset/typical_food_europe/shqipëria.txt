description=Flijais a typical dish of Albanian cuisine, prepared both in Albania and Kosovo. Although it is commonly termed as a pie or a cake, flija can more accurately be described as a stack of layered pancakes.

The batter is poured in such a pattern that the layers consist of triangle-shaped gaps.As each new layer is applied, it is immediately baked by covering the pie pan withsaç, a dome that's been previously heated over an open fire, topped with ash and cinders in order to preserve the temperature. Once the layer is baked, it is coated with fillings, then covered with a new thin layer of batter, and the baking process is repeated once again until all of the batter is spent.Flija can be served with various accompaniments including savory ones like sour milk, yogurt, pickled vegetables, cheese, andajvar, a spicy vegetable spread, as well as sweet ones: either a side of jam or a drizzle of honey.
