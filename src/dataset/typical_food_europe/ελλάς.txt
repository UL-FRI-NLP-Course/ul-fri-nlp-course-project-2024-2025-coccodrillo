Archaeologists have found evidence of flatbreads made by ancient civilizations across the Middle East and Mediterranean, including the Egyptians and Sumerians.The term "pita" is a Greek word, which means "pie" or "bread". This might suggest that the Greeks adopted this form of bread from their Middle Eastern neighbors. The bread is a staple in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines today, including those of Greece, Türkiye, Lebanon, and Syria.The simple process of making pita bread, which involves mixing wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt, then baking it at high temperatures, would have been achievable with the tools and resources available to ancient civilizations. The high heat causes the dough to puff up and create a pocket, which is a distinctive feature of pita bread.This pocket makes pita bread versatile for a variety of dishes, as it can be used to scoop up or hold various fillings. Pita is the perfect choice for steaks, lamb, falafel, kebabs, or chicken, and it is traditionally paired with hummus, tzatziki sauce, or tabouleh.

Ahilios, Vronderou, and Kalithea) in Fiorina prefecture.These large beans have been cultivated in this area since the 16th century. They have a thin, smooth, white skin and a distinctive kidney shape. The unique microclimate and composition of the soil in Prespon area are the main reasons why these beans are so rich in minerals and trace elements and so low in cholesterol and fat.Elephant beans should be soaked overnight before cooking to bring out their fullest flavor. While these giant beans are used to prepare 'Gigantes', a traditional vegetarianmezemade with tomato sauce, and a number of traditional soups, they are so rich in flavor that they also go great with nothing more than a drizzle of olive oil and a dash of salt and pepper.

food_type=Cheese
description=This cheese is traditionally produced from goat's or sheep's milk, although some dairies also use cow’s milk or a mixture of the three, taken from breeds reared on the Cyclades in the southern Aegean Sea. The diet of the animals is based on the area's endemic aromatic plants, which affect the flavor of their milk.In recent past, the traditional method of producing this cheese was improved by the addition of fresh butter made from the cream obtained after skimming the milk, but this butter can only amount to 15% of the total weight of the cheese. It increases the fat content and givesKopanistian even creamier texture.The flavor of this white to slightly pink cheese is often described as spicy, pungent, peppery, and reminiscent of Roquefort due to fermentation of bacteria such as penicillium and lactobacilli. The best-known types of Kopanisti are from Tinos and Mykonos.The cheese is mainly served as an appetizer alongside a glass of ouzo, retsina, or raki, and is often used in traditional dishes and sandwiches due to its creamy and spreadable texture. One of the most popular ways to use it is in a Myconian variation ofntakos- a barley rusk that's softened in olive oil and water, topped with chopped tomatoes, Kopanisti cheese, olive oil, and oregano.

food_type=kiwi-fruit
description=This kiwi variety is cultivated in the fertile plains of the Spercheios River valley in the prefecture of Phthiotis. Even though kiwi trees usually need well-drained soil to grow, this type has adapted well to the region's hot climate and high levels of precipitation.Despite its distinctive flavor, the Sperchiou kiwi is not as popular as other Greek varieties, mainly due to its high price and a lack of promotion. This is changing, however, and the Sperchiou kiwi is finally getting the recognition it deserves.It is distinguished by its easily peeled brown skin and juicy, delicately scented pulp. The flavor of Sperchiou kiwis is a perfect balance between sweet and sour, which makes this fruit best enjoyed in various fruit salads, healthy smoothies, or with some tasty Greek yogurt.

food_type=Cheese
description=Kariki is a unique and traditional cheese originating from the Greek island of Tinos. Kariki is essentially a blue cheese, but what makes it particularly special is that it's made from the milk of cows, sheep, or goats, and then aged in hollowed out and dried gourds, a method that contributes to its unique taste and texture.The aging process is crucial to developing Kariki's characteristic flavors. The cheese is first left to mature in the gourds for up to six months, where it naturally ferments and develops a strong, pungent flavor, similar to other well-known blue cheeses.However, unlike many blue cheeses that are inoculated with specific molds, Kariki's fermentation process relies on the natural flora present in the gourds and the environment, which gives it a distinct terroir-specific taste that cannot be replicated elsewhere.Kariki is not very well-known outside of Greece, making it a rare find for cheese enthusiasts. Its flavor is described as intensely spicy and salty, with a creamy yet crumbly texture. Due to its strong taste, Kariki is often enjoyed as part of a cheese platter, paired with sweet fruits like figs or pears, or used sparingly in salads and other dishes to add a depth of flavor.
