description=Elongated, crispy, crunchy and intensely fragrant, churros consist of deep-fried yeast dough encrusted with sugar. Although some may argue against consuming these sweet treats, warning others about the dangerous effects of sugar and fat on human bodies, the popularity of churros throughout the world doesn't seem to wane.Originally invented by Spanish shepherds who could easily cook them in a pan over an open fire, today these unusually shaped, cinnamon sugar sprinkled twists are most commonly eaten in Spain and Latin America as a hot breakfast food, accompanied by a strong cup of coffee or a cup of thick hot chocolate.Their characteristical shape is achieved by pressing the dough through plastic tubes so it emerges on the other side in thin, ridged ropes. Although churros are a Madrid specialty, the ones found in Seville are often praised because they differ in a lighter and more delicate texture.In Cuba, they may be filled with guava, in Mexico with dulce de leche, and in Uruguay with cheese.

description=Roscón de Reyes is a sweet ring-shaped bread that is prepared with a sweet, yeasted dough and comes topped with sugar and candied or dried fruit.

The cake appears under various names throughout Spain, southern France, Portugal, and Latin America - it is often flavored with orange blossom water or rum, while the center is occasionally filled with marzipan or whipped cream.Spanish tradition also suggests hiding a dry fava bean and a king figurine inside the cake.

description=One of the most emblematic dishes of Madrilenian cuisine known as cocido madrileño is a hearty meat and chickpea stew whose origins can be traced back to the medieval-era Castilla La Mancha. Some food historians claim that this one-pot meal evolved from a peasant dish calledolla podrida Manchega, but wasn't named cocido madrileño until the 17th century.However, most sources agree that the famed dish has its roots in the Sephardic stew calledadafina–a Shabbat kosher meal based on chickpeas, vegetables, and either hard-boiled eggs or meat such as lamb, veal, beef, or chicken. With the arrival of the Inquisition, feared of prosecution by the Catholic priests who roamed the streets of Madrid at the time–in search of both Jewish and Muslim cookery–the converted Spanish Jews called Marranos started incorporating pork into their adafinas to prove themselves as Christians.Over time, with the addition of lard, bacon, Serrano ham,chorizo(pork sausages) andmorcilla(blood sausages), adafina reportedly became the dish that is now known as cocido madrileño. This substantial meal is traditionally served in three separatevuelcosor courses: the first one is a rich, flavorful stock with added noodles; the second vuelco consists of chickpeas and vegetables, while the meat is dished out as the third course.Once commonly consumed during winter, cocido madrileño can nowadays be found prepared throughout the year in many of Madrid's restaurants and taverns.
