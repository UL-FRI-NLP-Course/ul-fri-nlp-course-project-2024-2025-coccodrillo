description=Cremeschnitte is avanilla-flavored custard cream cake and an absolute classic among central and eastern European desserts.It is known by many names, most of which have stemmed from the Germancremeschnitte, and literally translate to eithercream sliceor, in some cases,cream pie.According toHistorical Sociolinguistics, it is believed that the origins of the cremeschnitte date back to the blend of two cuisines in the Austro-Hungarian empire.However, its Polish nameNapoleonkaindicates that this dessert might have possibly originated from the Frenchmille-feuille, which is also known asthe Napoleon- another pastry whose exact origin is unknown, even though its modern form was said to be influenced by improvements of Marie-Antoine Carême, the famous French chef-extraordinaire.Still, while the Napoleon is made up of three layers of puff pastry alternating with two layers of pastry cream, the typical cremeschnitte is made with only two layers of puff pastry held together by a hefty amount of vanilla-flavored pastry cream, which is sometimes topped with a thin layer of whipped cream.Cremeschnitte is most often simply sprinkled with icing sugar, but it can also be topped with a glossy and smoothglacéicing, and nicely decorated with a traditionalchevrondesign. Two of the most popular cremeschnitte varieties include the aforesaid Polish Napoleonka orkremówka, which was known to be the favorite dessert of Pope John Paul II, and Sloveniankremna rezina, the signature dessert of Bled; a popular Alpine resort settled on the shores of the eponymous lake.

Sacher-Torte is said to taste the best when accompanied by a small cloud of unsweetened whipped cream on the side.It was invented in 1832 by Franz Sacher, a pastry chef for Prince Clemens Lothar Wensel Metternich, the State Chancellor of Austria at the time. The prince wanted a new cake, and Sacher, 16 years old at the time, obliged him by creating something new from ingredients that were readily available in the kitchen.Suffice to say, the cake was a huge hit, and Franz's son Eduard opened a hotel calledSacherin 1876, serving the popular cake up to this day.

food_type=sweet-pastry
description=A traditional pastry dessert with a rich and vivid history, apfelstrudel (apple strudel) is one of Austria's most popular delicacies. This sweet treat consists of thin layers of dough filled with a flavorful apple filling. Its story starts with the invention of baklava, a filo pastry popular in the Balkans and the Middle East.Since baklava requires very thin dough, similar to strudel, the technique was likely perfected by either the Ottomans or the Greeks. It is believed that strudel arrived in Hungary first, then Austria, due to the fact that the Ottomans had constant interactions with the Habsburgs.The oldest known recipe for strudel dates back to 1696, while other varieties, such as the apple strudel recipe, date back to the 1800s. Some claim that the dish was invented in Vienna for the Emperor of Austria and the rest of high society. Depending on the recipe, the filling may additionally include raisins, cinnamon, rum, and nuts such as almonds or walnuts.It is recommended to serve the strudel warm, straight from the oven, accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, or vanilla sauce.

description=Considered a variation on the traditionalfrankfurter würstchen(frankfurter sausage), wiener würstchen is the name of an Austrian sausage that is typically prepared with a mixture of pork and beef. The combination is finely chopped and seasoned with spices such as white pepper, coriander, mace, paprika, salt, and ginger before it is placed into a thin sheep intestine, smoked, and parboiled.It was back in 1805, in Vienna, when Johann Georg Lahner, a butcher from Gasseldorf but trained in Frankfurt, created a new variety of sausage by adding beef to the original frankfurter, which was made exclusively from pork. Initially, his creation carried the nameLahners würstel, but it soon came to be known asfrankfurter würstel- a name that has stuck until today in Austria.In Germany, the sausage came to be known as wiener würstchen (meaningViennese sausagein German), referring to the place where the production of these sausages initially began. Another reason why the Germans had to call these sausages wiener würstchen instead of frankfurter sausages, as was the case in Vienna, was because of the protected status that frankfurter würstchen have been enjoying in the country since 1860.These sausages are usually enjoyed in pairs, either warm or cold, and they are typically simply heated in boiling water, roasted, or grilled.

description=Even thoughtafelspitzis today one of the most popular Austrian dishes, this succulent boiled veal dish was once reserved only for the ruling class, and it was the favorite dish of Emperor Franz Joseph I. According to the 1912 imperial cookery book, tafelspitz was standard fare at the court, and "his Majesty’s private table was never without a fine piece of boiled beef." The nametafelspitz(lit. a tip [of meat] for the table) refers to a cut from the top hind end of the cow just below the tail, though some cooks prefer to use top round or chuck for this dish, while the richest and juiciest meat comes from a leg cut calledbeinfleisch.Regardless of the cut, the meat is always simmered slowly with root vegetables. Some chicken pieces and a marrow bone may also be added to the mix, and the pot is constantly skimmed, resulting in a crystal clear broth. Traditionally, tafelspitz is eaten in separate courses: first comes the broth that's served hot in bouillon cups, followed by tender slices of beef which are usually accompanied by potatoes, carrots, and a creamy apple-horseradish and chive sauce.

description=Schnitzel Wiener Art is a take on the classic of Austrian cuisine, the Wiener schnitzel, a breaded and fried veal cutlet. But unlike the traditional Wiener schnitzel, the schnitzel Wiener Art is made with a pork cutlet, not a veal one. The reason behind this switch is the fact that pork is much cheaper and more available than veal.Today, most restaurants in Austria and Germany serve the Wiener schnitzel made with pork and not the real Wiener schnitzel. Luckily, they are obliged by law to state so on their menu. Schnitzel Wiener Art is prepared the same way as the traditional Wiener schnitzel.The pork is thinly pounded, breaded, and pan-fried, usually in oil or a mix of oil and butter. When it comes to serving, the same side dishes are served as with the traditional Wiener schnitzel — a potato salad, French fries, and parsley potatoes will all do, and to cut through the fat, any of the following — a dollop of lingonberry jam, a salad, or lemon wedges to squeeze over the meat — should also be present when the schnitzel is served.

The creation became an instant success, and since Fürst did not patent the praline, many similar products appeared on the market, including the perfectly round Mirabell version.In 1995 it was decided that only Fürst’s creation, which is sold wrapped in silver foil, may be labeled as the Original Salzburger Mozartkugel.
