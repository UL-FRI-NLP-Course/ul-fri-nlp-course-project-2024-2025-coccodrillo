description=Delicious and fragrant waffles are the most famous Belgian culinary trademark. Made with thick dough or thin batter, the cakes are baked in a specially designed waffle iron which creates an unusual checkered pattern on the top and bottom of each cake.In Belgium, there are two distinct varieties of this national dessert: the light Brussels waffle, and the denser Liege waffle. The key distinction is in the batter: while the Brussels waffle batter is thin and runny, the Liege variety is made with a thick, brioche-like dough which produces a cake with uneven edges and dense texture.However, this distinction is only recognized in Belgium, while everywhere else in the world, this popular dessert is known simply asthe Belgian waffle. Even though waffles have been present in Belgian cuisine since the Middle Ages, and were initially made with a mixture of barley and oats, they were made famous at World’s Fair, held in New York in 1964.Read more

It is a decorative bay tree that has been trimmed down to a perfect shape. It must be at least five years old and grown in a pot.The trees are remarkably uniform in size and shape, which is a result of more than 400 years of cultivation during which the best mother plants were used to further perfect the next batch. In addition to being genetically outstanding, each tree is perfectly pruned to achieve symmetry and a variety of shapes such as a pyramid, sphere or pillar.Since they are grown in the harsh, cold climate of Flanders, they can withstand winters much better than their southern counterparts which makes them very popular in Russia, the United Kingdom and other colder countries. What is also interesting about the ‘Vlaamse laurier’ is that only eleven growers produce more than 105,000 trees every year, mostly for export.Since this particular laurel tree is ornamental, it is often used at exhibitions and for wedding decorations, both in Belgium and abroad.

Flanders Reds are often blended, and most examples are aged in oak barrels, which may impart subtle chocolate, vanilla, and spice notes.These beers pair well with heavier, fatty dishes, such as stews, braised meat, or roasted duck, but they can also be a good match to lighter dishes that share similar tart flavors.

food_type=ales
description=Saison, which translates asseason, is a Belgian style ale that originated in the French-speaking region of Wallonia as a seasonal thirst-quenching beer that was mainly brewed during winter or fall, and it was then left to ferment until the summer.Also known as farmhouse ale, it was made by farmers, and though each brewer had a unique recipe, saisons were usually pale, low in alcohol, and had distinctive spicy notes. The style is believed to have originated sometime in the 18th century, but its popularity declined by the end of the 20th century.Only recently, it has been reintroduced by various craft breweries that brew versatile saisons which are typically higher in alcohol and which range from pale golden to light amber. Modern versions also often include spices and tend to be fruity and subtly malty, with light hop bitterness.They are oftenbottle-conditioned—they undergo a second fermentation in the bottle—and tend to be quite effervescent and refreshing. Although they are quite versatile in character, most varieties can match full-flavored and spicy dishes, seafood, creamy cheese, and even tangy desserts.

description=Bière brut, also known asbière de Champagne, is a somewhat new beer style that was first introduced in Belgium in the early 2000s. The beers are top-fermented and then allowed to mature in the bottle with Champagne yeast cultures.These beers are dry, clean, bubbly, light-bodied, and refreshing. They can range from very pale gold to pale amber. Their alcohol content is higher than in most beers, typically around 8% ABV. They are usually bottled in 750-milliliter champagne-style bottles that are corked and caged.Bière brut style is mainly defined by its production technique. The beer is bottle-conditioned to create a secondary fermentation within the bottle. After aging, the beer is riddled and disgorged (remuage and dégorgement). These are traditional Champagne methods in which the bottles are turned to move the sediment to the cork, and the yeasty sediment is then removed after the second fermentation.Bière brut is not your everyday beer style. Because of the time-consuming production process, it is rare and usually expensive. Because of its light character, this beer would pair well with shellfish, salads, and citrus flavors. It can also be enjoyed as an aperitif.

description=Grisetteis a beer style that hails from Hainaut province in Belgium. Often compared to saison—the preferred choice among Belgian farmers—grisette was a farmhouse ale developed to satisfy the needs of the local miners. By 1960, the style disappeared, and its revival was not as big as with saison.The style was not well documented, so the exact characteristics of the original are difficult to pinpoint. The beer was most likely a refreshing and hop-forward pale ale that varied in color and strength. Modern interpretations of grisette were introduced in the 1990s, and since there was no specific historical framework, they tend to vary in character.They can be described as light, approachable, refreshing, and moderately hoppy, with low alcohol content, typically around 4% ABV. They usually have a dry finish, while some may have spicy, fruity, or funky character. It is not clear what is the origin of the name.Grisettecan be translated aslittle gray, and while some theories claim the name was inspired by the ladies who wore gray aprons and served grisette, some suggest that it was a reference to the gray dust that the miners were covered at the end of the day.
