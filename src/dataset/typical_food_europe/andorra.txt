description=Trinxat is a savory Andorran dish consisting of chopped and mashed cabbage and potatoes with the addition of mushrooms, garlic, pork or bacon, salt, pepper, and olive oil. The name is derived from the Catalantrinxar, meaningto slice, mash, or chop.The mash gets flattened into small pancakes that are fried in oil and garnished with bacon pieces.Trinxat is an ideal winter dish due to the fact that cabbage is the best after it's been touched by frost, and it doesn't get any better conditions than those on high altitudes of Andorra's mountainous parts. Locals learned to make the most of the crops that grow on poor soil, so it is not unusual that potatoes are heavily represented in the dish.It is quick, easy and inexpensive to prepare, and has achieved such popularity that it even has its own festival, celebrated in the town of Puigcerdá. For the most authentic experience, it is recommended to garnish this flavorful hash pancake with some finely chopped parsley and enjoy it while it's still piping hot.

description=This beef of exceptional quality comes from the hardy, brown coatedBruna d'Andorrabreed or from crosses between the cows of Bruna breed and bulls of theCharolais,LimousinandGasconbreeds.All the cattle must be born, fed and reared within the designated geographical zone which includes the entire territory of Andorra, a tiny mountain principality settled in the eastern Pyrenees and landlocked between France and Spain. The animals are slaughtered and sold after a minimum period of eight months, and in order to comply with the standards of breeding in a stress-free environment, the maximum distance they can travel while being transported to the butchery is limited to 25 kilometers.Due to the high quality mountain pastures and a specific fattening process which includes cereals and pulses, the tender, juicy and succulent Andorra beef is particularly prized and sought after.
