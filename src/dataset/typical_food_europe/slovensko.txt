food_type=Dumplings
description=Halušky is the incredibly soft variety of potato dumplings, usually associated with Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The dough is created with grated raw potatoes and flour. They are typically cooked so the batter is spread on the wooden board, and small pieces of dough are cut and dropped directly into the boiling water.Another, more modern approach, employs a special halušky strainer through which the batter is gently pressed and dropped in water, creating tiny dumplings in the process. Both techniques result in irregularly shaped dumplings which have a soft texture and pale color.Similar types of dumplings are found in numerous Central and East European countries, the most famous being the thick Germanspätzle. Although halušky are easily found in supermarkets, these tender potato dumplings are traditionally prepared from scratch at many Slovak and Czech households.They are usually served alongside traditional meat dishes, but the most famous combination is known asbryndzové halušky, a Slovak classic consisting of halušky, salty sheep cheese, and fried bacon.
