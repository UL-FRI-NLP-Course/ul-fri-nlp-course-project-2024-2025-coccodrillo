description=Before every traditional Russian main meal, there arezakuski, a course of appetizers that are usually served to guests who are seated around the table, although a buffet arrangement is also quite common. For special events, there might be a dozen or two dozen zakuski served to the guests.Typically, zakuski include appetizers such as cold cuts of meat, salads, pirozhki, cured fishes, pickled vegetables, a selection of cheeses, bread, and caviar. Zakuski is the most important course, and most hosts will spend much more time preparing and arranging zakuski than preparing the main course.The origins of zakuski are still shrouded in a veil of mystery, but it is speculated that the custom arose before the 19th century as a way of feeding guests who traveled long distances and whose arrival couldn't be predicted, so they were fed small bites of food while the main meal was being prepared.A bottle of vodka often takes the center spot on the table, since the zakuski table is meant to accompany and enhance the experience of drinking it, and shots of vodka are often repeated throughout the meal. Along with butter and bread, such as white, black, or a combination of rye and wheat, caviar is the most famous part of zakuski, often served in glass containers and consumed on its own, or on a piece of toasted white bread.

food_type=pancakes
description=These traditional Russian pancakes are prepared with flour, eggs, milk, yeast, and a pinch of salt.

food_type=beef-dishes
description=When it first appeared in the mid-19th-century Russia, beef Stroganoff was a dish made out of lightly floured beef cubes that have been sautéed and cooked in a simple sauce made from stock and mustard with only a small amount of sour cream.The origin of the dish is unclear, but it is most likely linked to a French chef—or a French-trained chef—working for the Stroganoff family. Although Russian in origin, the dish is strongly influenced by the French style of cooking—this is most obviously seen in the way the beef is cut, in either cubes or strips.The first known recipe appeared in Elena Molokhovets’sA Gift to Young Housewives,published in 1871. Since then, the dish has had major alterations. The beef is still cut in strips, but the sauce is much richer; with sliced mushrooms and onions that are cooked with beef stock and thickened a bit with sour cream that is only stirred in at the end.The dish is traditionally served with potato straws, but is often served with either rice pilav, egg noodles, or mashed potatoes.
