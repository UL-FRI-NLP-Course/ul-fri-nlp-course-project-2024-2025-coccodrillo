food_type=lagers
description=Pilsneris a beer style that originated in Pilsen (Plzeň), a city in western Bohemia. It was first brewed in 1842, making it one of the youngest beer styles to appear in modern brewing. The style originated when the citizens of Pilsen, who grew unhappy with the quality of the beer, decided to build Bürger Brauerei (Citizens’ Brewery), which would later become Pilsner Urquell.They eventually brought a Bavarian brewmaster Josef Groll—who went to create the first pilsner brew. Although the initial idea was to create a Bavarian-style lager, the use of Czech ingredients influenced the emergence of a new style. The original pilsner, which was one of the first versions of a clear, light-colored beer, was made with light malted barley from Moravia and Saaz hops.The style was soon imitated across the world, with varying results. Nowadays, the official classifications divide the style into two main regional categories: Bohemian and German pilsner. Despite slight differences in style and numerous imitations around the world, the best pilsner examples will be crisp and refreshing, with a dominant hop character.In the Czech Republic, only beer from Pilsen is referred to as pilsner, while in Germany, the name that is most commonly used for pilsner brews ispils.
