Today, most of these crackers are factory-produced, but easy preparation and convenient storing make it a standard homemade option.Light, easy to crack and to handle, it is a perfect accompaniment that is served alongside a variety of appetizers, dips, sauces, cold meat cuts, smoked salmon, cheese, and fruit spreads.
